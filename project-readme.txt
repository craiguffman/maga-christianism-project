# MAGA Christianism Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains research, analysis, and publication materials for an integrated project examining the theological distortions present in MAGA Christianism and developing constructive alternatives through Participatory Freedom Theology.

## Core Frameworks

### Seven Theological Mutations
The project identifies and analyzes seven theological mutations that co-articulate in MAGA Christianism:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity

### Participatory Freedom Theology
This constructive theological alternative emphasizes:

- **Trinitarian Foundation**: Freedom emerges from participation in divine life
- **Freedom as Non-Domination**: Freedom as capacity to love rather than absence of constraint
- **Being With**: Incarnational presence rather than doing for/to others
- **Reformed Catholic Synthesis**: Integration of Reformed insights and Catholic sensibilities
- **Democratic Virtue**: Character formation for participatory politics

## Publication Structure

The project publishes across five complementary streams:

1. **Monday**: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
2. **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (spiritual formation)
3. **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
4. **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (historical analysis)
5. **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)

Additional content includes:
- **Lexicon Entries**: Created ad hoc to support the five main streams
- **Weekend Wisdom**: Practical applications created on an as-needed basis
- **Special Features**: Occasional content outside the regular structure

## Core Prompt Templates

The project utilizes standardized prompt templates for consistent outputs:

1. **Source Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of academic sources
2. **Thematic Synthesis**: Integration of insights across multiple sources
3. **Article Analysis**: Analysis of contemporary articles for publication
4. **Artifact Creation**: Standard structure for creating content artifacts

## Workflow Integration

This project integrates across multiple tools:

- **VSCode**: Primary text editor and version control
- **Tana**: Knowledge management and note-taking
- **Scrivener**: Long-form content development
- **Descript**: Audio/video content creation
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **Claude**: AI-assisted research and content development

## How to Use This Repository

### For Research
1. Use the source_analysis template for analyzing new sources
2. Create thematic syntheses to integrate across sources
3. Use article_analysis for contemporary materials
4. Follow the established metadata structure for integration

### For Content Creation
1. Use the artifact_creation template for new content
2. Refer to voice_synthesis guide for consistent tone
3. Follow publication stream guidelines for specific content types
4. Maintain version numbering for all significant updates

### For Claude Integration
1. Configure Claude using established preferences
2. Use standardized prompts for consistent outputs
3. Focus on the modular integration of Claude-generated content
4. Maintain version history for all Claude interactions

## Version Tracking
All significant files use a consistent versioning approach:
- Timestamp-based filenames: YYYYMMDDHHMM_descriptive_name.extension
- Version notation: v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, etc.
- Version history section in each file documenting changes

## Contribution Guidelines
