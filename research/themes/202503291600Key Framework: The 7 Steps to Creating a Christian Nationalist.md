I've analyzed the sermon transcripts, and they provide rich material for your MAGA Christianism critique project. Let me extract the key anecdotes, arguments, and frameworks that would be most valuable for your outline.

## Key Framework: The 7 Steps to Creating a Christian Nationalist

From the October 2, 2022 sermon, you provide a comprehensive breakdown of how Christian nationalism develops:

1. **Supersessionism (Marcionite Heresy)**: Displacing Jews as the chosen people and replacing them with Europeans/Americans as God's new chosen people, creating a hierarchy of human value.

2. **Pedagogical Posture**: Adopting a position of superiority where white Christians believe they possess the gospel and can assess others' compliance with it, justifying colonization.

3. **Utility-Based Identity**: Replacing place-based identity with portable identity tied to bodies and productivity, valuing people for what they produce rather than their connections.

4. **Individual Salvation**: Reducing the gospel to a story about personal salvation rather than God's communal reconciliation of creation.

5. **Primitive Biblicism/Adoptionism**: Reducing scripture to law and stripping Jesus of his Jewish identity and ongoing role in believers' lives.

6. **Liberalism on Steroids**: Making freedom (defined as independence) the highest value rather than love, with freedom understood as "nobody can mess with me."

7. **Protestant Work Ethic**: Believing prosperity indicates faithfulness, leading to judgment that those who don't prosper must be unfaithful.

This framework provides an excellent analytical structure for your book's theological critique section.

## Powerful Anecdotes and Illustrations

1. **The Houston Mega-Church Sermon** (September 4, 2022 sermon): The anecdote about a pastor at Second Baptist Church of Houston using the Book of Revelation to declare "holy war" against "wokeness" demonstrates how apocalyptic language is weaponized against political opponents.

2. **"How Can You Say Jesus Was a Jew?"** (October 2, 2022 sermon): The encounter where Christians were outraged at learning Jesus was Jewish perfectly illustrates how Christian nationalism has divorced itself from historical Christianity.

3. **Water Fountain Liturgy** (briefly referenced): Your personal experience growing up with segregation in Baton Rouge demonstrates how social practices formed moral imagination without explicit instruction.

4. **German Church in the 1930s** (August 28, 2022 sermon): The parallel between German Christians asking Jewish Christian pastors to leave their positions and contemporary Christian nationalism shows the historical pattern of religious accommodation to cultural xenophobia.

5. **The Rich Man and Lazarus** (September 25, 2022 sermon): Your framing of Lazarus as "a poor black American boy" trapped in intergenerational poverty creates a powerful contemporary application of Jesus's parable.

## Key Arguments

1. **Tyrant's Playbook Pattern** (September 4, 2022 sermon): You outline how dominant powers cling to control through apocalyptic rhetoric, painting themselves as victims and saviors, sowing chaos, then using it to justify a return to power under the banner of "law and order."

2. **Historical Pattern of Resistance to Equality** (September 4, 2022 sermon): You trace how after each victory for equality (Lincoln, Civil Rights movement, Obama's election), "resistance arose like weeds overtaking a neglected garden," using the language of law and order to protect dominant power.

3. **Christian Blindness to Lazarus** (September 25, 2022 sermon): Your argument that white Christians, unlike Black Christians and white non-Christians, remain blind to economic inequality due to Christian nationalism provides a powerful theological diagnosis.

4. **Biblical Justice vs. Secular Justice** (August 28, 2022 sermon): Your definition of justice as "that act which in every moment enables us to live as reconciled people" rather than "getting what one deserves" offers a theological alternative to retributive frameworks.

5. **Salvation as God's Gift of Memory** (September 11, 2022 sermon): Your framing of salvation as "remembering who you are by remembering whose you are" provides a theological counter to Christian nationalist identity formation.

## Theological Concepts for Your Framework

1. **Two Economies: Manna vs. Mammon** (September 18, 2022 sermon): Your contrast between God's economy of manna and abundance versus mammon and exploitation provides a theological lens for critiquing economic dimensions of MAGA Christianism.

2. **Jubilee as Core Christian Practice** (August 28, 2022 sermon): Your explication of Leviticus 25 and Jubilee as "the generative principle of Christianity" offers a biblical basis for critiquing systems of debt and inequality.

3. **"Get Out of His Way"** (September 4, 2022 sermon): The concept of "making ourselves small so that he is big" and channeling Christ's love rather than our own provides a theological alternative to dominance-seeking.

4. **The Intersection of Love and Justice** (October 2, 2022 sermon): Your framing of Christian life as living at "the intersection of love and justice" offers a powerful alternative to power-oriented Christianity.

5. **Christocracy vs. Democracy** (August 28, 2022 sermon): Your concept of Christians participating in democracy as "brothers and sisters of a Christocracy" provides a framework for Christian political engagement that's distinct from partisan alignment.

## Most Relevant to MAGA Christianism Critique

The most compelling elements for your critique:

1. The "plantation preacher" metaphor, identifying those who "preach the myth of a lost cause" that America was once great and would be great again if only "good Anglo Protestants take to the streets to take back that which was stolen from them."

2. Your analysis of how Christian nationalism "can't grasp why it's essential to our own transformation that we celebrate that Jesus is a Jew," showing how it divorces itself from Christianity's Jewish roots.

3. The contrast between servant power and dominant power, with your assertion that Jesus teaches "Don't lust for dominant power, embody servant power. That's how you follow me."

4. Your distinction between guilt and responsibility, using the analogy of new executives taking over a company that dumped toxic waste - they're not guilty of the original act but are responsible for cleaning up the mess.

5. The identification of binary apocalypticism as using Revelation to divide the world into simplistic categories of good/evil, us/them, creating a false view of reality that enables dehumanization.

These elements provide powerful theological, historical, and personal dimensions for your critique of MAGA Christianism, particularly how it distorts Christianity's core tenets to justify power-seeking and exclusion rather than the radical love and justice taught by Jesus.
