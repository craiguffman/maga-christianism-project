## Definition
Nationalism as analyzed by Michael Freeden represents a "thin-centered ideology" that lacks the comprehensive scope of full ideologies. Unlike complete ideological systems, nationalism provides only a partial framework focused on national identity and sovereignty, requiring supplementation from host ideologies to achieve comprehensiveness.

## Key Components
- **Ideological Thinness**: Nationalism "rarely appeared on its own but was taken over by host ideologies: conservatism, liberalism, fascism"
- **Supplementary Requirement**: Contains "outward-pointing sockets that enable additional and systematic plug-ins to be attached" to broaden its ideational appeal
- **Developmental Potential**: Has "the potential to become full if [it] incorporate[s] existing elements of other ideologies"
- **Limited Problem-Solving**: Unlike comprehensive ideologies, nationalism lacks systematic solutions to political problems beyond identity concerns

## Significance
Freeden's analysis fundamentally challenges how we categorize and respond to Christian nationalism. By establishing nationalism as a thin-centered ideology incapable of providing comprehensive political solutions on its own, it suggests Christian nationalism similarly lacks ideological completeness. This has significant implications for analyzing MAGA Christianism, suggesting it functions not as a coherent theology or complete worldview, but as an identity marker with ideological fragments that gain power through combination with other political frameworks.

## Scholarly Context
Freeden's work on thin-centered ideologies provides an essential analytical framework within political theory. His approach builds upon but differs from classical ideology studies (Marx, Mannheim) by focusing on morphological analysis of ideological components. This framework has been applied to populism (Mudde, Kaltwasser) and can similarly illuminate Christian nationalism as a political phenomenon. Freeden's approach specifically clarifies why nationalist movements tend to align with and borrow from more comprehensive ideological systems.

## Applications to MAGA Christianism Analysis
- **Hybrid Ideological Formation**: MAGA Christianism can be analyzed as a hybrid formation where "Christianism" and nationalist elements function as thin-centered ideological components mutually reinforcing each other
- **Borrowed Comprehensiveness**: Explains why Christian nationalism draws from conservative, populist, and sometimes libertarian ideologies for policy solutions beyond identity assertions
- **Theological Thinness**: Supports our analysis that theological content in MAGA Christianism is often thin and selective, focusing primarily on identity markers rather than comprehensive theological frameworks
- **Strategic Alignment**: Helps explain the strategic alliance between religious and nationalist movements despite theological incongruities

## Related Concepts
- [[Thin-Centered Ideologies]]: Freeden's broader conceptual framework encompassing nationalism, populism, and other incomplete ideological formations
- [[Brubaker on Christianism]]: Brubaker's analysis of Christianism as identity marker parallels Freeden's approach to nationalism
- [[Christian Nationalism Definitions]]: Various scholarly attempts to define Christian nationalism can be evaluated through Freeden's framework
- [[Tribal Epistemology]]: The thin-centered nature of nationalism may contribute to its reliance on group-based knowledge claims

## Research Questions
- How does the "thinness" of nationalism affect its susceptibility to being co-opted by more comprehensive ideologies?
- If Christian nationalism is a thin-centered ideology, what are its core concepts versus its borrowed elements?
- What implications does this have for how we analyze and respond to Christian nationalist movements?
- Does the thin-centered nature of nationalism explain why it so readily combines with religious identity markers?
