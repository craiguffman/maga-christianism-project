- William Sims Bainbridge and I have distinguished between sect movements and cult movements (Stark and Bainbridge 1979, 1985, 1987). The former occur by schism within a conventional religious body when persons desiring a more otherworldly version of the faith break away to “restore” the religion to a higher level of tension with its environment. This is the process of sect formation analyzed by H. Richard Niebuhr (1929). Sociologists can cite both theory and considerable research to show that those who take part in sect movements are, if not the dispossessed, at least of lower social standing than those who stick with the parent body.

- Cult movements, on the other hand, are not simply new organizations of an old faith; they are new faiths, at least new in the society being examined. Cult movements always start small—someone has new religious ideas and begins to recruit others to the faith, or an alien religion is imported into a society where it then seeks recruits. In either case, as new faiths, cult movements violate prevailing religious norms and are often the target of considerable hostility.

- The starting point is to notice that religion can in fact compensate people for their inability to gain certain things they desire. However, the inability of humans to satisfy desires has two quite different aspects. First, some people are unable to gain desired rewards that are only scarce—rewards that others are able to obtain, or to obtain in more ample amounts. These include the tangible rewards such as wealth and health, the lack of which underlies all deprivation interpretations of religion. Clearly, religions provide a variety of effective mechanisms by which people can endure such deprivations, including promises that earthly sacrifice will merit heavenly recompense. But we must also recognize a second aspect of deprivation: the ability of religion to compensate people for desired rewards that seem to be absolutely unavailable to anyone, at least in this life. The most obvious of these, and perhaps the one most intensely sought by humans, is victory over death. No one, rich or poor, can gain eternal life by direct methods in the here and now. The only plausible source of such a reward is through religion, and the fulfillment of this promise is postponed to another world, a world known only through religious means. Finally, we must recognize that as organized social enterprises, religions are a source of direct rewards to members. That is, religious organizations reward some people with status, income, self-esteem, social relations, entertainment, and a host of other things they value. These distinctions lead to the following propositions (Stark and Bainbridge 1980). ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=613))

- First: The power of an individual or group will be positively associated with control of religious organizations and with gaining the rewards available from religious organizations. Second: The power of an individual or group will be negatively associated with acceptance of religious compensators for rewards that actually exist. Third: Regardless of power, persons and groups will tend to accept religious compensators for rewards that do not exist in this world.

- The second of these propositions captures the long tradition of deprivation theories of religion: that the poor will pray while the rich play. We may call this the otherworldly or sectlike form of religious commitment. The first proposition, on the other hand, explains the relative absence of the lower classes from more conventional religious organizations, for it captures the religious expression of privilege. We can call this the worldly or churchlike dimension of religious commitment. The third proposition can be called the universal aspect of religious commitment, since it notes that in certain respects everyone is potentially deprived and in need of the comforts of faith. It is this proposition that explains why the upper classes are religious at all, why they too are susceptible to faith (something Marxist… ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=629))

- To state this as a proposition: Religious skepticism is most prevalent among the more privileged. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=645))

- although sociologists have long believed that people who give their religious affiliation as “none” are primarily secular humanists, considerable recent research shows this not to be the case. Most such people are merely indicating a lack of conviction in a conventional brand of faith, for they are also the group most likely to express interest in belief in unconventional mystical, magical, and religious doctrines. For example, “nones” are the group of Americans most willing to accept astrology, yoga, reincarnation, ghosts, and the like (Bainbridge and Stark 1980, 1981). Moreover, people who report their original religious background as “none” are extremely overrepresented in the ranks of converts to new religious movements (Stark and Bainbridge 1985).

- But can it really be true that it is the privileged who are most likely to embrace new religious movements? This is precisely what we ought to expect when we realize that conversion to a new religion involves being interested in new culture—indeed, in being capable of mastering new culture.

- What is true of new technology, fashions, and attitudes ought also to be true in the realm of faith. For new religions always involve new ideas. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=657))

- While sects are able to appeal to people of little intellectual capacity by drumming the old, familiar culture, new religions find such people difficult to reach. Thus they must gain their hearings from people of social standing and privilege. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=661))

- But sometimes there is substantial discontent with conventional faith among the more privileged. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08783D3C1&location=664))

- sometimes a traditional faith and its organized expression can become so worldly that it cannot serve the universal need for religious compensators (proposition 3). That is, religious bodies can become so empty of supernaturalism that they cannot serve the religious needs of the privileged either. At such moments, the privileged will seek new options. Indeed, it is the privileged who will be most aware of erosions of the plausibility structure of conventional faiths.
