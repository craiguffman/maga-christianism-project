### Highlights

- This work is an attempt to demonstrate that the liberal tendency to overlook the value inherent in nationalism is mistaken, and to explore ways in which nationalism might contribute to liberal thinking. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=117))

- In the pursuit of this task, it breaks away from the liberal tendency to describe nationalism as resting merely on irrational (some say primitive) fears of “the stranger,” as motivated by a morally irrelevant attraction to what is familiar and similar, by an unscrupulous desire for power, or as an excuse to grab advantages for one nation at the expense of others. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=121))
- Underlying nationalism is a range of perceptive understandings of the human situation, of what makes human life meaningful and creative, as well as a set of praiseworthy values. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=125))
- have consequently refrained from taking a frequently offered piece of advice suggesting I renounce the concept of “nationalism” in favour of a less emotionally loaded term, such as “people” or the much discussed “community.” ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=129))
- Liberals who give up this term and surrender it to the use of conservative political forces, or note the difference, to chauvinist and racist ideologies, alienate themselves from a whole set of values that are of immense importance to a great many people, including liberals. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=132))
- If the conflict between liberalism and nationalism is, as Gellner describes it, “a tug of war between reason and passion,”2 liberals might feel obliged to give liberal values priority over national convictions. But if this description is simplistic and misleading, there may be no easy way of ranking these two sets of values. Liberals might then have to acknowledge that a wide range of incommensurable and incompatible values and norms are relevant to their life, and seek a reasonable compromise. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=143))
- This book suggests that the liberal tradition, with its respect for personal autonomy, reflection, and choice, and the national tradition, with its emphasis on belonging, loyalty, and solidarity, although generally seen as mutually exclusive, can indeed accommodate one another.

- How can we determine which will be more valuable to the individual’s well-being—a wide range of civil liberties or membership in a flourishing cultural group, full-scale autonomy, or a deep sense of belonging? ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=157))
- Arguing that national values should be acknowledged and respected, rather than dismissed as inherently groundless and irrational, entails a move toward greater moral complexity and more frequent collisions between rights and values. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=158))
- Tidiness is not a proper end for heterogeneous societies, says Berlin; there are no perfect answers to social problems, and the pursuit of absolute solutions too often leads to oppression or bloodshed. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=160))

- It presents nationalism as a way of thinking about human nature and about a world order, from which prescriptive implications for moral and political thought might be derived. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=169))
- On the contrary, nationalists can endorse this notion and claim that, by nature, individuals are members of particular human communities. Outside such communities they cannot develop a language and a culture, or set themselves aims. Their lives become meaningless; there is no substance to their reflection, no set of norms and values in light of which they can make choices and become the free, autonomous persons that liberals assume them to be. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=173))
- It is argued in this work that although cultural choices are neither easy nor limitless, cultural memberships are not beyond choice. In this sense, the view of culture and communal membership developed here differs from the perfectionistic and collective approach generally adopted by communitarians, in that it cherishes openness, reflection, and individual choice. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=181))
- “imaginary” implies that, unlike the family, the tribe, or the people, the nation exists only when its members consciously conceive themselves as distinct from members of other groups. This “illusive” definition makes it hard to draw clear distinctions between a nation and other types of cultural communities. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=201))
- This demand for a public sphere in which the cultural aspects of national life come to the fore constitutes the essence of the right to national self-determination. This right is to be distinguished from the right to self-rule, which is the right to take part in the political institutions that govern one’s life. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=210))
- Liberal nationalism is predicated on the idea that all nations should enjoy equal rights, and in fact derives its universal structure from the theory of individual rights found at its core. If national rights rest on the value that individuals attach to their membership in a nation, then all nations are entitled to equal respect. The justification of national rights is thus separated from the glorious or tormented past of each nation, from its antiquity, or from its success in attaining territorial gains. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=221))
- Its most immediate consequences touch on the claim that membership influences the moral obligations of individuals. Members have certain special obligations and responsibilities toward each other, thereby sustaining a claim for partiality: Individuals thus have a reason, although not an ultimate one, to prefer members over nonmembers. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=227))
- Were homogeneous nation-states possible, liberal nationalism would pose no problems. But most contemporary states are multinational, and under these circumstances, the demand that a state should reflect one national culture entails harsh implications for members of minority groups. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=245))
- The most important aspect of this distinction is that nationality, which is here used to describe membership in a nation and not in its misleading yet widespread connotation of citizenship, should not be a criterion for participating in the political sphere or for the allocation of goods and services. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=248))
- Moderate nationalism offers a coherent theoretical position, indeed, a more coherent one than its more extreme “relatives.” Why should liberal nationalism, which places reflection, choice, and internal criticism at its center, and rejects the notion that nationalism must necessarily “exalt the idea of the nation above all other ideas,”4 be defined as postnationalist? ([Location 1625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1625))
- The outcome of this process is a redefinition of legitimate national goals and the means used to pursue them. Liberal nationalism thus celebrates the particularity of culture together with the universality of human rights, the social and cultural embeddedness of individuals together with their personal autonomy.

- Arguing that one could approach nationalism as a theory entails an attempt to uncover the presence of some unifying characteristics able to cut across the myriad of claims raised by different national groups. The existence of these characteristics is often masked by the character of the nationalist discourse which, by its very nature, insists on presenting national claims as unique, a product of each nation’s distinct identity. Nationalists prefer to justify their claims by reference to the particular culture, history, and religion of their nation, rather than by relating them to a broad theory that could fit other national groups. On this count, nationalism differs from other schools of thought. Whereas liberals, for instance, often go out of their way to demonstrate that their specific policies, however remote, correlate with a general theory, nationalists consistently attempt… ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1650))
- a theory of nationalism is, by nature, polycentric. It necessarily recognises and cherishes the plurality of the national phenomenon. ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1672))
- The claim that the Jews are God’s chosen people thus cannot be justified with reference to a theory of nationalism, although it is certainly a nationalist claim. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1674))
- Cruise O’Brien claims that virtually every Christian nation took the idea of a chosen people in the promised land and applied it to itself. Although unsure of the full number, O’Brien observes that “writers of the following nations explicitly refer to their people as chosen and to their land as promised: England, France, Germany, Spain, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland, and especially and insistently the United States, for both whites and blacks took up this theme.”9 Other nations, such as Israel, Iran, and Egypt, could be added to this list. But no nationalist would ever describe the pretension to be a chosen people living in a promised land as part of a general pattern, as this would invalidate the claim. Being chosen is only meaningful if others are not. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1679))
- It is attractive because it captures the importance of context, of cultural affiliations, of the need for roots, for belonging, for human development and self-fulfillment, thereby illuminating a broad range of issues that liberal theory tends to brush aside.

- are two different and incompatible discourses embedded in each national claim. One tends to describe the particular sequence of events through which a nation has evolved by referring to what is unique to the group, thus developing arguments that are only meaningful to the group’s members. The other emphasises the universal dimension of politics, places the national story within a framework, and relates it to that of other nations, thus developing arguments that are also meaningful within a general context. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1691))
- Israelis tend to view the establishment of the state of Israel in light of their personal and painful history of expulsion and persecution, from the days of the destruction of the Second Temple through the horrors of the Holocaust and present-day anti-Semitism. This narrative is told in ways that necessarily lead to one conclusion: Due to the tragic sequence of events that marks Jewish history, Jews need a state of their own to secure their existence and to ensure a public sphere where Jewish life can prosper. The story told by the Palestinians follows a similar path of sorrow, expulsion, and mistreatment, and reaches the same conclusion: Palestinian history teaches that in light of their long oppression and in order to ensure their self-protection, Palestinians need a state of their own. The Israeli and Palestinian claims are both grounded in their past suffering. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1696))
- The notion of the contextual individual and its concomitant implications, which rely on the right of individuals to be self-determining, on the acknowledgment of the importance of cultural membership, and on the assertion of a general right to culture and national self-determination, must therefore be at the center of any theory of nationalism. ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1711))
- Cultural nationalism, Kohn argues, preaches the establishment of closed societies, favours the authoritarian uniformity of state and faith, and fosters xenophobia. Its goals are “narrow, self-centered, antagonistic”; it sees the nation as “a political unit centering around the irrational pre-civilized folk concept,” lending itself “more easily to the exaggeration of imagination and excitation of emotions.” In short, Kohn’s cultural nationalism is on the verge of the pathological and doomed to culminate in catastrophe. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1716))
- Liberal nationalism bears no resemblance to Kohn’s description. In fact, it is mainly characterised by the features Kohn had assigned to the Western nationalism modeled on the Enlightenment: It is pluralistic and open, sees national groups as not only a product of history, but also of human will, and broadly follows humanistic tradition. It is structured in line with the assumptions of ethical individualism, stating that “the only way to justify any social practice is by reference to the interests of those people who are affected by it.”11 Accordingly, it rules out appeals in the name of God, Nature, History, Culture, the Glorious Dead, the Spirit of the Nation, or any other such metaphysical entities, unless these claims can be justified in terms of human interests.

- the strong communal dimension of all forms of nationalism is undeniable, and liberal nationalism indeed assumes that living within one’s national community is of value to individuals. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1729))
- in the open and ever-changing modern world, life in a cultural environment that is familiar, understandable, and thus predictable is a necessary precondition for making rational choices and becoming self-governing.

- A national life allows individuals to enjoy a degree of self-fulfillment they cannot experience on their own. Liberal nationalism does not claim that individuals can find true freedom and expression only through complete identification with the community. It does not endorse claims such as those voiced by Fichte, that only by completely identifying with the whole can man become really man, realising himself in utmost plentitude, and it is this realisation that is the perfect freedom. Membership in a national community is not viewed in perfectionist terms, although it is still assumed that it allows individuals to lead a more meaningful life.

- the nationalist belief that every action taking place within the boundaries of a national entity is endowed with additional meaning. In every field of human activity—music, theatre, literature, sports, the army, or the economy—every action performed within a national context counts both as a contribution to that particular field and as a contribution to the national endeavour. ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1745))
- From a national perspective, the painter working in the solitude of his atelier, the poet writing to his loved one, or the athlete competing in a sports event, strive for the pinnacle of their own individual achievements but, willingly or unwillingly, they are also contributing to the advancement of their own particular nations.

- Liberal nationalism takes issue with both these claims. It argues that membership in a nation is elective, since individuals can leave the nation of their birth and create new national affiliations, and that this turns the adherence to a culture and the assumption of national obligations into voluntary acts rather than inevitable consequences of fate. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1792))
- In the literature on nationalism—Anderson, Deutsch, Gellner, Hertz, Smith, Snyder—the term “obligation” is rarely found. Instead, we usually find terms such as “duty” and “loyalty.” The use of these terms is meant to allude to the involuntary, ultimate nature of national affiliations, to portray them in radical terms as a commitment to support the nation unconditionally, to accept blindly all its cultural and social features, to be ready to sacrifice one’s life to protect it and ensure its continued existence. According to this interpretation, loyalty means nothing less than a total commitment, an effacement of the individual vis-à-vis the nation. But this is only one possible interpretation of loyalty in general and of national loyalty in particular. We are supposed to be loyal to our family and friends, to the values we hold as well as to our nation. Under very extreme and extraordinary circumstances, these loyalties could indeed demand that we sacrifice our lives. We are not, however, usually required to take our displays of loyalty to such extremes. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1798))
- On the other hand, if self-sacrifice is only demanded in rare and extreme cases, but is not the one and only defining characteristic of national obligations, then these obligations share a great deal with other associative commitments.

- There are several general aims every nation is likely to pursue: assuring its continued existence, the well-being of its members, the flourishing of its culture. To assume national obligations thus means acquiring special responsibilities toward fellow nationals, contributing to the ongoing existence of the national unit, partaking in the continuous re-creation of its culture, learning and respecting its traditions, and engaging in a political struggle that will ensure the nation a public sphere of its own.

- Today, Hebrew is the mother tongue of several million people for whom speaking Hebrew is no longer part of a conscious and deliberate effort. Many Israelis today feel safe enough to incorporate English words when speaking or writing in Hebrew. They are no longer purists of their own language but are open to learning others as well as incorporating foreign expressions. By using the language, they fulfill their national obligation and contribute to the process of re-creating their own culture. Nevertheless, were they ever threatened or forbidden to speak their language, they too might be ready to risk their liberty and their lives for it. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1820))
- They can also stay within their culture, develop special mutual responsibilities, and retain and foster a sense of exclusiveness, thereby contributing to the preservation of the nation as a lively social unit. This does not entail that nationalists are culturally conservative or that they revere their own particular culture. They can be critical of it; they can aspire to change it, develop it, or redefine it. They may be deeply disappointed by it, believing it to be in decline and inferior to other cultures. ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1826))
- the assumption of national obligations implies the reflective acceptance of an ongoing commitment to participate in a critical debate about the nature of the national culture, suggesting that individuals have a reason to adhere to their national obligations even after the establishment of a nation-state. Hence, contrary to Seton-Watson’s claim that independent nations, which are territorially satisfied and nationally conscious, no longer need nationalism, this interpretation views a commitment to the nation as a sustained, enduring project. This project involves encouraging individuals to remain, by choice, within their national group, to actively participate in the continued re-creation of their national culture, and to contribute to the well-being of their fellow members. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1840))
- the most common way of fulfilling national obligations is not through self-sacrifice, or by subordinating one’s well-being and interests to the welfare of the collective, but rather by participating in a cultural dialogue. The language we teach our children, the bedtime stories we tell them, and the lullabies we sing to them, are as good a way of satisfying our national obligations as a declaration of readiness to die for the sake of the nation.

- Contrary to widespread perceptions, national communities might, in some respects, be more open and pluralistic than communities in which social bonds rely on a set of shared values.

- the rubric of what Walzer calls “reiterative universalism.”16 Reiterated acts of self-determination create a world marked by differences. A theory of nationalism grounded in the assumption of reiterative universalism is necessarily polycentric, that is, it presupposes that there is one civilisation but many nations and views particularistic national struggles as variations on a theme. Every national struggle thus represents an attempt to re-create the particularity of each nation, but also reflects the aspiration to join the “family of nations, the international drama of status equals, to find its appropriate identity and part.”17 Reiterative universalism thus… ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1861))

- polycentric nationalism has a methodological advantage: It is free from the theoretical limitations inherent in particularistic nationalism. Ethnocentric nationalists, by relying on arguments exclusively related to one particular nation, rule out a universal justification of national rights and lose the ability to hold a meaningful dialogue with members of other nations.

- Fascism is also a reversal of the trend of “polycentric nationalism.” It introduces additional elements “which in themselves contradict ‘polycentric’ tenets, and substitutes the State for the Nation, as the prime object of collective allegiance and identification.”26 Racism again reverses the “polycentric” trend, although it could be regarded as a post-Darwinian aberration of “ethnocentric” nationalism.

- “Racism,” “sexism,” and “chauvinism” are, respectively, a ranking of races, sexes, and states, but “nationalism,” claims Walzer, works differently. It is entirely compatible with a theory of incommensurability or with mere agnosticism about ranks and orders. “Nationalists are more like patriots, in that they can respect and value commitments similar to their own in other people—and they can do so, unlike egoists, without viewing the others as competitors and antagonists.” ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003Z9L2Z0&location=1942))

- Yet, the fact that the liberal welfare state is necessarily predicated on certain “national beliefs” is often overlooked. Its conception of distributive justice is only meaningful in states that do not see themselves as voluntary associations but as ongoing and relatively closed communities whose members share a common fate. Within such communities, members develop mutual attachments that supply the moral justifications required for assuming mutual obligations, without which the idea of a “caring state” is unsustainable.
