## Just Freedom (Pettit)

### Core Concept: Freedom as Non-Domination

Philip Pettit's conception of freedom as non-domination provides a theological framework that directly addresses the political problems at the heart of MAGA Christianism. Rather than defining freedom merely as non-interference (the libertarian view that underpins much of right-wing politics), Pettit recovers a more robust understanding that aligns remarkably well with a Trinitarian theology of human flourishing.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. Freedom Requires More Than Non-Interference**

The libertarian view of freedom as mere non-interference is inadequate. Pettit argues that true freedom requires "the absence not just of interference, but of the subjection to another that was known at the time of the Roman republic as dominatio or domination." This distinction is critical for our theological critique of MAGA Christianism, which has embraced a libertarian conception of freedom that actually enables domination.

Consider Pettit's example of Nora from Ibsen's "A Doll's House": she may enjoy non-interference from her husband Torvald, but she remains unfree because her choices depend entirely on his goodwill. She enjoys what Pettit calls "free rein" rather than true freedom. This perfectly illustrates how MAGA Christianism's libertarian concept of freedom masks deeper forms of domination - the freedom to dominate others becomes mistaken for freedom itself.

**2. Freedom as a Social and Relational Reality**

Pettit argues that freedom "presupposes society and consists in being secured against the power of others in that society to intrude on your basic liberties." This social conception aligns perfectly with a trinitarian understanding of freedom as rooted in relationship rather than isolation or autonomy.

This connects directly to Part I of our book project, particularly Chapter 2 on Trinitarian foundations. The Trinity reveals divine freedom not as absolute autonomy but as perfect relationship without domination. When we reduce freedom to mere non-interference, we distort not only our political arrangements but our understanding of God's very nature.

**3. Institutional Requirements for Freedom**

Pettit outlines three domains of policy that enable freedom as non-domination:

- **Infrastructure**: The institutions and material conditions necessary for freedom
- **Insurance**: Protection against vulnerability that creates domination
- **Insulation**: Defense against asymmetrical power relationships

These domains directly counter MAGA Christianism's practical atheism (Part III of our project). When Niebuhr reduced Jesus to "the name of the one who saves us from sin" while adopting philosophical pragmatism for ethics, he enabled the separation of Christian identity from the practical requirements of freedom. MAGA Christianism continues this pattern, claiming Christian identity while supporting policies that enable domination rather than freedom.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 3: Knowledge of God

Pettit's discussion of how we "test the truth of ideas by the manner in which they 'work'" resonates with Hooker's approach to "special equity" and the application of general principles to particular circumstances. We should emphasize how MAGA Christianism's primitive biblicism systematically ignores the contextual nature of ethical knowledge, creating a false confidence in universal application that masks domination.

#### For Chapter 7: The Priority of the Particular

Pettit's "eyeball test" - that people should be "so resourced and protected in the basic choices of life that they can look others in the eye without reason for fear or deference" - provides a powerful evaluative criterion for policy. This directly counters MAGA Christianism's tendency to substitute abstract principles for concrete attention to human flourishing.

#### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Pettit's republicanism offers a framework for a post-MAGA Christian politics that neither accommodates secular liberalism nor retreats into reactionary opposition. As he writes: "The democratic project is to bring as many groups as possible into the discursive practice of holding one another responsible for commitments, deeds, and institutional arrangements—without regard to social status, wealth, or power."

### Theological Reflection

What makes Pettit's account of freedom particularly valuable for our project is how it recovers a pre-modern understanding of freedom that aligns with trinitarian theology while addressing contemporary political challenges. MAGA Christianism embodies three theological distortions I've identified: primitive biblicism, practical atheism, and binary apocalypticism. Each of these distortions corrupts our understanding of freedom.

The primitive biblicist reduces freedom to a set of abstract principles divorced from contextual application. The practical atheist claims the name of Christ while adopting a pragmatic politics that enables domination. The binary apocalypticist divides the world into friends and enemies, making freedom impossible for those designated as enemies.

Against these distortions, Pettit's account of freedom as non-domination provides a framework that is both theologically sound and politically viable. It reminds us that Christian freedom is not primarily about individual autonomy but about creating conditions where all can flourish without domination - a political vision that flows directly from the non-dominating love of the Trinity.

This framework allows us to articulate a post-MAGA vision of Christian engagement with democracy that is neither accommodationist nor separatist, but genuinely transformative.

## Beyond Justification (Campbell)

### Key Theological Insights from Campbell

Campbell's critique of Justification Theory (JT) provides perhaps the most important theological foundation for our critique of MAGA Christianism. His work demonstrates how a misreading of Paul has generated a contractual understanding of salvation that distorts both our theology and our politics.

#### 1. The Contractual Misreading of Paul

Campbell identifies what he calls "Justification Theory" (JT) as a misreading of Paul that has dominated Western Christianity. According to this theory:

1. All humans have an innate knowledge of God's moral demands
2. All have failed to meet those demands 
3. Christ satisfies God's wrath through substitutionary punishment
4. Individuals appropriate Christ's righteousness through faith

This contractual framework shapes not only theology but political imagination. It creates a rigidly binary world divided between saved and unsaved. It makes divine acceptance contingent on correct belief. Most importantly, it portrays God fundamentally as a retributive judge rather than as Trinity.

#### 2. The Alternative: Paul's Actual Gospel

Campbell shows that JT occupies only about 10% of Paul's writing, and these passages are better understood as Paul's rhetorical engagement with opponents. Paul's actual gospel is:

1. Participatory - we participate in Christ's death and resurrection
2. Resurrectional - Christ's resurrection is central, not just his death
3. Transformational - we are genuinely changed, not just declared righteous
4. Trinitarian - the Father, Son, and Spirit work together in our deliverance

This alternative reading aligns perfectly with the trinitarian foundations of our project. It allows us to critique MAGA Christianism not as "insufficiently biblical" but as fundamentally misreading Paul through contractual rather than participatory lenses.

#### 3. The Political Implications

Campbell demonstrates that JT generates problematic political implications:

- It creates an "othering dynamic" that divides the world into saved and damned
- It makes God primarily retributive, justifying retributive political arrangements
- It reduces salvation to correct belief rather than transformation
- It separates theology from ethics, allowing one to claim Christian identity while living by non-Christian values

These theological distortions directly enable what I'm calling MAGA Christianism - a political theology that maintains Christian identity while adopting non-Christian values.

### Integration with Book Project

#### For Part II: First Mutation – Primitive Biblicism

Campbell's work directly addresses what I've called the "primitive biblicist" mutation in MAGA Christianism. He shows how claiming direct, unmediated access to scripture has created a false confidence in a contractual reading of Paul that distorts Christian theology.

For Chapter 5 on Ramist Realism, we can use Campbell to show how both ancient and modern readers claim to "just read what the Bible says" while importing contractual frameworks that fundamentally misread Paul. The very claim to be "just reading the text" masks the interpretive decisions that produce JT.

For Chapter 6 on Scripture's Authority, we can use Campbell to distinguish between reading scripture with its christological center (resurrection) versus reading it through contractual frameworks. This isn't about liberal versus conservative readings but about participatory versus contractual frameworks.

#### For Part III: Second Mutation – Practical Atheism

Campbell's critique helps us understand how Christians can adopt non-Christian practices while maintaining Christian identity. By reducing salvation to a contractual legal transaction, JT effectively sidelines Jesus from everyday ethics and politics.

For Chapter 9 on Niebuhr, we can show how Niebuhr's Christian Realism represents a sophisticated version of this reduction, where Jesus saves us from sin but plays no role in political ethics.

For Chapter 10 on Christ as Supreme Exemplar, Campbell's participatory alternative offers a corrective - if salvation means participation in Christ, then Christian ethics must flow from this participation rather than from separate pragmatic considerations.

#### For Part IV: Third Mutation – Binary Apocalypticism

Campbell's critique directly addresses how JT creates binary apocalyptic thinking:

For Chapter 13, his analysis of JT shows how this contractual framework necessarily creates a binary world - saved/unsaved, righteous/unrighteous.

For Chapter 14 on Friend/Enemy Distinctions, Campbell helps us see how misreading Paul creates theological authorization for politics based on enmity rather than reconciliation.

### Summary for Current Project

Campbell's work provides theological authorization for our critique of MAGA Christianism. We can now argue that MAGA Christianism isn't just politically problematic but theologically distorted - it emerges from a fundamental misreading of Paul that replaces trinitarian participation with contractual justification.

This isn't about liberal versus conservative theology but about recovering Paul's actual gospel from distortions that enable political arrangements incompatible with the cruciform pattern of Christ. When we read Paul correctly, we find that "those who bear crosses are working with the grain of the universe."

## Constructing an Incarnational Theology (Wells)

### Core Theological Insights

Samuel Wells offers a profound theological corrective to the distortions of MAGA Christianism through what he calls "incarnational theology." His framework directly addresses the theological mutations I've identified, particularly the practical atheism that enables Christians to claim Christian identity while practicing non-Christian politics.

#### 1. God's Purpose is "Being With"

Wells argues that the primary purpose of creation is not to solve the problem of sin but to enable God to be with us and us to be with God. This reframes the entire Christian narrative:

"God chose to be incarnate in Jesus before there was any creation, because in Christ, God willed to be in relationship with us. Which means God's intention to become incarnate in Jesus was the reason for creation."

This directly counters MAGA Christianism's practical atheism, which effectively sidelines God's presence from political and social life. If God's fundamental purpose is "being with," then Christian political engagement must embody this same commitment rather than seeking power over others.

#### 2. The Cross as Non-Domination

Wells offers a powerful alternative to contractual atonement theories:

"If in any society you enjoyed a form of public entrenchment that enabled you to exercise all choices in a suitable set of liberties without worrying about the goodwill of others, or the goodwill of government, then you would live up, intuitively, to the image of the liber or free citizen."

For Wells, the cross doesn't represent contractual satisfaction of divine justice but the ultimate expression of God's commitment to be with humanity even in the most extreme circumstances: 

"The cross does not represent contractual satisfaction of divine justice but the ultimate expression of God's commitment to be with humanity even in the most extreme circumstances."

This reframing of the cross connects directly to Pettit's concept of freedom as non-domination and provides theological depth to our critique of MAGA Christianism.

#### 3. Three Forms of Christian Practice

Wells suggests three forms of relationship that Christians must practice:

- **Covenant**: Relationships of commitment beyond contractual terms
- **Community**: Relationships of mutual belonging and responsibility 
- **Communion**: Relationships of intimate presence and shared identity

These three forms directly counter the contractual, individualistic, and binary patterns of MAGA Christianism.

### Integration with Book Project

#### For Part I: Theological First Principles

Wells provides a theological foundation for our critique by reframing the entire Christian narrative around "being with" rather than contractual salvation. This helps us establish in Chapter 2 that trinitarian theology isn't just abstract doctrine but the pattern of relationship into which we're invited.

For Chapter 4 on virtue formation, Wells helps us show how Christian practices form us into people who naturally embody the "being with" pattern of the Trinity, rather than seeking domination over others.

#### For Part III: Practical Atheism

Wells directly addresses what I've called the "practical atheism" of MAGA Christianism - claiming Christian identity while practicing non-Christian politics.

For Chapter 9 on Niebuhr, Wells helps us critique the reduction of Jesus to "the name of the one who saves us from sin" while adopting philosophical pragmatism for ethics.

For Chapter 12 on the Church as Alternative Community, Wells offers a vision of the church not as chaplain to power but as embodiment of God's "being with" pattern in the world.

#### For Part IV: Binary Apocalypticism

Wells helps us counter binary apocalypticism by showing how even the cross represents God's commitment to be with us rather than divide the world into saved and damned.

For Chapter 16 on Christian Humanism, Wells provides theological grounding for a politics that seeks neither power over others nor retreat from the world, but rather embodies God's "being with" pattern in the public square.

### Summary for Current Project

Wells provides the positive theological vision that our critique of MAGA Christianism requires. By reframing Christian theology around "being with" rather than contractual salvation, he offers a theological corrective to the mutations that enable MAGA Christianism.

This isn't about liberal versus conservative theology but about recovering the incarnational heart of Christianity from distortions that enable political arrangements incompatible with God's commitment to be with us in Christ. When we understand God's purpose as "being with," we can no longer claim Christian identity while practicing politics based on domination, fear, and enmity.

## With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas)

### Core Theological Insights

Stanley Hauerwas provides a vital theological critique of both William James and Reinhold Niebuhr that helps us understand the theological roots of MAGA Christianism. His work is particularly helpful for addressing what I've called the "practical atheism" mutation.

#### 1. The Critique of William James

Hauerwas shows how James reduced religion to "nothing more than a disguised humanism." For James, religion is valuable only insofar as it supports democratic values and sustains hope in the human project. This reduction sets the stage for what Hauerwas calls the "teaching of contempt" - the marginalization of Christianity's distinctive claims about God.

This analysis helps us see how MAGA Christianism, despite its religious rhetoric, often functions as disguised humanism - using religious language to advance political goals while effectively sidelining God's actual presence and demands.

#### 2. The Critique of Reinhold Niebuhr

Hauerwas's critique of Niebuhr is even more relevant for our project:

"Niebuhr agreed with James that Christianity must be tested by its capacity to sustain liberal democracy." 

"Niebuhr is often interpreted as the Christian alternative to William James. But unfortunately, at least from my perspective, Reinhold Niebuhr agreed with James that Christianity must be tested by its capacity to sustain a liberal democracy."

This shows how even Niebuhr, who is often seen as recovering Christian orthodoxy, continued the pragmatic reduction of Christianity to its usefulness for democracy. This helps us understand how MAGA Christianism can claim Christian identity while subordinating Christianity to nationalist goals.

#### 3. The Barthian Alternative

Hauerwas presents Karl Barth as the great alternative to both James and Niebuhr:

"I argue that Karl Barth is the great 'natural theologian' of the Gifford Lectures because he rightly understood that natural theology is impossible abstracted from a full doctrine of God."

This Barthian approach insists that we cannot understand the world properly apart from knowing God in Christ. This directly counters the practical atheism of MAGA Christianism, which effectively operates as if God is absent from the political sphere.

### Integration with Book Project

#### For Part I: Theological First Principles

Hauerwas helps us establish in Chapter 2 that trinitarian theology isn't optional but essential for proper theological and political understanding. We cannot derive Christian political ethics from general principles abstracted from God's self-revelation in Christ.

#### For Part III: Practical Atheism

Hauerwas directly addresses what I've called the "practical atheism" of MAGA Christianism in his critique of Niebuhr:

For Chapter 9, Hauerwas shows how Niebuhr reduced Jesus to "the name of the one who saves us from sin" while adopting philosophical pragmatism for ethics. This helps us understand how MAGA Christianism can claim Christian identity while practicing non-Christian politics.

For Chapter 10 on Christ as Supreme Exemplar, Hauerwas's Barthian alternative reminds us that Christ is not just the one who saves us from sin but the one who reveals what it means to be fully human.

#### For Part IV: Binary Apocalypticism

Hauerwas's famous quotation helps us counter binary apocalypticism by showing how the cross represents the true pattern of the universe:

"The point that apocalyptic makes is not only that people who wear crowns and who claim to foster justice by the sword are not as strong as they think... It is that people who bear crosses are working with the grain of the universe."

This reminds us that Christian apocalyptic isn't about dividing the world into friends and enemies but about revealing the true pattern of reality already established in Christ's cross and resurrection.

### Summary for Current Project

Hauerwas helps us understand how Christianity became reduced to its usefulness for democracy, setting the stage for MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to its usefulness for nationalism. By recovering Barth's insistence that we cannot understand the world properly apart from knowing God in Christ, Hauerwas provides theological resources for critiquing MAGA Christianism's practical atheism.

This isn't about liberal versus conservative theology but about recovering Christianity's distinctive witness from pragmatic distortions that enable political arrangements incompatible with the cruciform pattern of Christ. When we understand that "people who bear crosses are working with the grain of the universe," we can no longer claim Christian identity while practicing politics based on power and domination.

## World Upside Down (Rowe)

### Core Theological Insights

Kavin Rowe's work provides crucial insights into how early Christianity functioned as an alternative political community rather than merely a set of personal beliefs. This directly counters MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to a cultural identity compatible with American nationalism.

#### 1. Christianity as Culture-Making

Rowe shows how early Christianity was understood not as a set of private beliefs but as a comprehensive way of life that created an alternative culture:

"For Luke and not for Rome, the pax of the dominus mundi is the kind of humble service that accepts its own suffering and death. The particular challenge entailed in the Roman emperor's claim to be the κριος πντων thus turns out to take the form of a violent refusal of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, the primacy of peace that is manifested in the willingness to serve God rather than humans through trial, suffering, and death."

This understanding of Christianity as culture-making rather than merely belief-affirming directly challenges MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to cultural identity compatible with nationalism.

#### 2. The Lordship of Christ as Primary

Rowe challenges the common assumption that early Christians were primarily challenging Caesar's lordship:

"Contra Horsley, Wright, Crossan, Reed, and others, Jesus does not challenge Caesar's status as Lord, as if Jesus were somehow originally... The thought—at least in its Lukan form—is rather much more radical and striking: because of the nature of his claims, it is Caesar who is the rival; and what he rivals is the Lordship of God in the person of Jesus Christ."

This insight helps us understand that Christian political witness isn't primarily about opposing secular power but about affirming Christ's lordship, which then necessarily relativizes all other claims to ultimate authority.

#### 3. Peace Through Service, Not Force

Rowe shows how Luke's gospel redefines peace in terms of service rather than force:

"Where the lordship of the Roman emperor entailed a pax predicated upon pacifying strength and terror, the lordship of Jesus, so Luke believed, produced a revaluation of the world's sense of pax."

This directly challenges MAGA Christianism's embrace of force and dominance as means of securing peace and order.

### Integration with Book Project

#### For Part I: Theological First Principles

Rowe helps us establish in Chapter 2 that Christian identity isn't primarily about affirming beliefs but about being formed through practices of discipleship in a community shaped by Christ's lordship.

#### For Part III: Practical Atheism

Rowe directly challenges what I've called the "practical atheism" of MAGA Christianism by showing how early Christianity embodied Christ's lordship in concrete social practices.

For Chapter 12 on the Church as Alternative Community, Rowe's analysis of early Christianity provides a model for how the church can function as a culture-making community rather than merely a collection of like-minded individuals.

#### For Part IV: Binary Apocalypticism

Rowe helps us counter binary apocalypticism by showing how early Christianity's distinctive politics wasn't based on friend/enemy distinctions but on the revaluation of peace through service rather than force.

### Summary for Current Project

Rowe helps us understand the political implications of Christ's lordship in ways that directly challenge MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to cultural identity. By recovering the culture-making function of early Christianity, Rowe provides resources for critiquing MAGA Christianism's practical atheism and binary apocalypticism.

This isn't about liberal versus conservative politics but about recovering Christianity's distinctive witness from distortions that enable political arrangements incompatible with the cruciform pattern of Christ. When we understand Christianity as culture-making rather than merely belief-affirming, we can no longer claim Christian identity while practicing politics based on power and dominance.

## Democracy and Tradition (Stout)

### Core Theological Insights

Jeffrey Stout's work provides crucial insights into how democracy itself functions as a tradition with its own virtues, practices, and habits of discourse. This helps us understand how MAGA Christianism represents a distortion not only of Christianity but also of democratic tradition.

#### 1. Democracy as Tradition

Stout challenges the common opposition between democracy and tradition by showing how democracy itself constitutes a tradition:

"Democratic culture is best understood as a set of social practices that inculcate characteristic habits, attitudes, and dispositions in their participants. Because those practices do involve a sort of deference to authority (as well as much defiance of authority) and have achieved enough stability to be transmitted from one generation to another, it makes sense to call them a tradition in their own right."

This insight helps us understand that the choice isn't between tradition and innovation but between different traditions - including the tradition of democracy itself with its distinctive virtues and practices.

#### 2. Rights as Social Statuses

Stout offers a compelling account of rights not as abstract natural entitlements but as socially recognized statuses:

"All rights are normative social statuses. To have the status of a right is to have a legitimate claim on others for the enjoyment of a good."

This social understanding of rights aligns with the trinitarian foundations of our project and helps us critique the libertarian individualism that often characterizes MAGA Christianism.

#### 3. Democratic Virtues

Stout identifies distinctive democratic virtues that counter the postures of domination:

"The virtues, postures, moods, and gestures that become habitual in democratic culture include 'self-esteem,' 'openhandedness,' refusal 'to stand in the presence of superiors,' and 'fluency of speech.'"

These democratic virtues directly counter the authoritarian tendencies of MAGA Christianism and align with the trinitarian pattern of relationship without domination.

### Integration with Book Project

#### For Part I: Theological First Principles

Stout helps us establish in Chapter 4 that virtue formation happens through practices rather than merely through affirming principles. This challenges MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to cultural identity and abstract principles.

#### For Part III: Practical Atheism

Stout's account of democracy as tradition helps us critique what I've called the "practical atheism" of MAGA Christianism by showing how Christianity and democracy can be understood as distinct but potentially compatible traditions, each with its own virtues and practices.

For Chapter 11 on Practices vs. Principles, Stout's emphasis on democratic practices rather than merely democratic principles aligns with our critique of MAGA Christianism's reduction of Christianity to abstract principles divorced from practices.

#### For Part IV: Binary Apocalypticism

Stout's account of democratic discourse as involving authority and deference without authoritarianism helps us counter binary apocalypticism by showing how democratic tradition involves complex negotiations of authority rather than simple oppositions.

### Summary for Current Project

Stout helps us understand democracy not as the opposite of tradition but as a tradition in its own right, with its own virtues, practices, and habits of discourse. This insight allows us to critique MAGA Christianism's binary opposition between Christianity and democracy while also maintaining the distinctiveness of each tradition.

This isn't about choosing between Christianity and democracy but about understanding how both traditions might cooperate in fostering human flourishing without domination. When we understand democracy as tradition, we can better articulate how MAGA Christianism distorts both Christian and democratic traditions in service of dominance and exclusion.

## Hospitality as Holiness (Bretherton)

### Core Theological Framework: Ad Hoc Commensurability

Bretherton's "Hospitality as Holiness" provides a crucial theological framework for addressing the relationship between Christianity and other moral traditions. This directly relates to your project's aim to articulate a faithful Christian political witness that avoids both co-option by the state and isolationist sectarianism.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. The Problem of Incommensurability**

Bretherton, drawing on MacIntyre, articulates how different moral traditions can appear incommensurable—having no common standard of measurement to judge between their respective conceptions of what is rational and moral. This creates a seemingly intractable problem when Christians engage with non-Christians on contested moral issues.

This concept of incommensurability helps diagnose how MAGA Christianism positions itself as embattled against "secular" values while simultaneously adopting non-Christian political practices and frameworks. The apparent contradiction arises from a misunderstanding of the relationship between Christian moral reasoning and other traditions.

**2. Hospitality as a Normative Pattern of Engagement**

Hospitality represents "the normative pattern of faithful relations between Christians and those who are strangers to them." Unlike Grisez's appeal to natural law or an abstract general ethics, and unlike pure sectarianism, hospitality acknowledges both difference and the possibility of ad hoc moral commensurability.

This provides a theological alternative to both the co-option and competition dynamics you identify in MAGA Christianism. Rather than seeing politics as either assimilation or combat, hospitality offers a pattern of engagement that maintains Christian distinctiveness while recognizing genuine common ground.

**3. Justice, Truth, and Patient Endurance**

Bretherton's articulation of tolerance as "patient endurance" that is due to others as a matter of justice offers a powerful counter to MAGA Christianism's binary friend/enemy distinctions. Tolerance as a part of justice means that Christians have an obligation to endure differences even when they find them objectionable:

"Tolerance is a moral perfection, a virtue annexed to justice as one of its parts... the tolerant act justly and the just act tolerantly. They give what justice demands to those from whom they are divided by disagreement and dissent."

This challenges the apocalyptic binary that characterizes MAGA Christianism, which justifies intolerance toward those with different moral and political viewpoints.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 4: The Formation of Virtue

Bretherton's discussion of virtue formation through imitation and habituation directly supports your account of how Christians become virtuous through practices rather than merely through affirming principles.

#### For Chapter 7: The Priority of the Particular

Bretherton's emphasis on "special equity" and the necessity of attending to particular circumstances when applying general principles provides theological grounding for your critique of MAGA Christianism's tendency to apply decontextualized "biblical principles" to complex issues.

#### For Chapter 15: Fear of the Other vs. Love of Neighbor

Bretherton's account of hospitality as hallowing the stranger provides a theological framework for overcoming the politics of fear that characterizes MAGA Christianism. His distinction between tolerance and indifference offers resources for addressing difference without either capitulation or hostility.

---

## Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)

### Core Theological Framework: Jeremiah 29 as Political Witness

Bretherton's "Christianity and Contemporary Politics" provides a comprehensive theological vision for how churches engage politically in a pluralistic society. His use of Jeremiah 29 as a leitmotif for faithful political witness directly aligns with your project's aim to articulate a post-MAGA Christian politics.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. The Dynamics of Co-option, Competition, and Commodification**

Bretherton identifies three problematic responses to the contemporary political context:
- Co-option: letting the church be construed as a constituency within civil society serving state purposes
- Competition: reframing Christian political witness as identity politics competing for recognition
- Commodification: letting Christianity be construed as a lifestyle choice within the religious marketplace

These three dynamics precisely diagnose the pathologies of MAGA Christianism, which oscillates between being co-opted by nationalist politics, competing as an identity group, and commodifying faith as a cultural marker rather than a discipleship path.

**2. Christian Cosmopolitanism**

Bretherton develops a vision of "Christian cosmopolitanism" that avoids both protectionist nationalism and abstract universalism that denies the importance of particular places and identities:

"A properly theological cosmopolitanism must incorporate the fulfillment of humanity via differentiation into particular sodalities of persons that involve differences of language, kinship, and territoriality... For without discrete identities that take up and play with creation in particular ways through history there can be no interplay of persons in communion."

This offers a powerful theological alternative to MAGA Christianism's nationalist tendencies while avoiding the pitfalls of liberal cosmopolitanism that erases particularity.

**3. Community Organizing as Faithful Witness**

Bretherton analyzes community organizing as a form of faithful political witness that enables Christians to:
1. Form common objects of love with their neighbors
2. Negotiate the terms of faithful citizenship
3. Embody a generative alternative to totalizing power

This practical engagement model helps illustrate what faithful political witness might look like beyond the captivity to nationalist politics that characterizes MAGA Christianism.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 1: Introducing the Crisis of MAGA Christianism

Bretherton's analysis of the dynamics of co-option, competition, and commodification provides a framework for diagnosing the crisis of MAGA Christianism as a distortion of faithful Christian witness.

#### For Chapter 3: Knowledge of God: How Do We Know What We Know?

Bretherton's concept of "special equity" – attending to the particularities of context when applying general principles – directly supports your critique of MAGA Christianism's primitive biblicism.

#### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Bretherton's vision of Christian cosmopolitanism offers a constructive alternative to both MAGA Christianism and secular liberalism, showing how Christians can engage politically without compromising their distinctiveness.

---

## Tolerance Among the Virtues (Bowlin)

### Core Theological Framework: Tolerance as Virtue

Bowlin's "Tolerance Among the Virtues" provides a robust theological account of tolerance as a moral virtue annexed to justice. This directly challenges the friend/enemy binary that characterizes MAGA Christianism's approach to difference.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. Tolerance as Justice, Not Weakness**

Bowlin challenges the common assumption that tolerance represents weakness or moral relativism. Instead, he argues that tolerance is a virtue that perfects our capacity to respond justly to objectionable differences:

"Intolerance is a vice. Its act wrongs another person. It denies them a good they are due."

This reframing challenges MAGA Christianism's tendency to view compromise or tolerance as weakness rather than as a requirement of justice.

**2. Distinguishing Tolerance from Its Semblances**

Bowlin carefully distinguishes genuine tolerance from its semblances (indifference, acceptance, etc.) and from the vices that oppose it. This nuanced account helps diagnose how MAGA Christianism often
