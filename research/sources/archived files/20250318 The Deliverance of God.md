### Highlights

- Paul systematically reinterprets military imagery metaphorically. He also relocates any conflict within the human sphere to a war with oppressive heavenly powers. The last statement in the preceding quotation is a useful illustration of the first claim here. The verb translated “overcome” in the NRSV is νικάω, which often carried a military connotation and/or an agonistic sense. It was frequently an aggressive signifier (see BDAG 673). Yet Paul applies this word to a battle or struggle between Christian humanity and evil superhumanity. This achieves two things. First, any aggression is thereby relocated from intrahuman relationships to the relationship between saved humanity and the evil superhuman forces that currently enslave the cosmos. And, second, the nature of the conflict itself is reinterpreted. It is emptied of any coercive, violent sense because the notion of straightforward physical struggle or conquest is obviously inappropriate in relation to heavenly powers.

- This point is made especially clearly in the disputed Eph. 6:10–18. The Christian is armed there against the devil, the rulers, the authorities, “the cosmic powers of this present darkness, [and] the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” with truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, fidelity, salvation, and the Spirit, the latter being especially present in prayer. A more slender illustration of essentially the same point is provided by the undisputed 1 Thess. 5:8, where the Christian’s breastplate consists of faith and love and her helmet the hope of salvation. (See also Isa. 59:17.) ([Location 24844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QM7ZGRR&location=24844))
