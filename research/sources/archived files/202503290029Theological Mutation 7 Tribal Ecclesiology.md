# Theological Mutation 7: Tribal Ecclesiology

## Diagnostic Analysis

### Definition
Tribal Ecclesiology transforms the church from a boundary-crossing covenant community united in Christ into an exclusionary tribal identity group defined primarily by cultural, political, and social markers rather than theological confession and sacramental practice. It replaces the church's universal, reconciling mission with defensive protection of particular cultural expressions of faith.

### Key Characteristics
- **Cultural Captivity**: Identifies Christian faith with particular cultural expressions
- **Boundary Prioritization**: Focuses primarily on who's excluded rather than who's included
- **Identity Fusion**: Merges Christian identity with racial, national, and political identities
- **Selective Communion**: Creates implicit or explicit tests for fellowship beyond traditional creedal boundaries
- **Cultural Preservation**: Shifts church's mission from gospel proclamation to cultural conservation
- **Threatened Minority Complex**: Adopts siege mentality despite substantial cultural power
- **Homogeneous Unit Principle**: Values cultural uniformity over reconciled diversity

### Manifestations in MAGA Christianism
- Treating political disagreement as grounds for questioning others' faith
- Creating litmus tests for "real Christianity" based on cultural and political positions
- Portraying certain racial, regional, or cultural expressions of Christianity as more authentic
- Suspecting global Christianity that differs from American expressions
- Focusing on external threats rather than internal transformation
- Using evangelical identity as proxy for racial and cultural identity
- Resisting multicultural expressions of Christianity as "compromise"

### Theological and Social Consequences
- Contradicts New Testament vision of church transcending social divisions
- Prevents church from embodying reconciliation at the heart of the gospel
- Reduces church's witness to maintaining cultural power rather than proclaiming Christ
- Elevates secondary issues to communion-breaking status
- Creates churches segregated by political viewpoint rather than united in Christ
- Damages evangelistic witness by conflating gospel with cultural preferences
- Denies catholicity (universality) essential to Christian faith
