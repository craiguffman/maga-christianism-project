I'll create synthesis notes from The Empire of Cotton that relate to your book project on MAGA Christianism, drawing out theological and political insights through your theological voice.

# Cotton, Capitalism, and Christian Complicity: Theological Reflections from The Empire of Cotton

## Theological Mutations of Capitalism

### War Capitalism as Theological Distortion

Sven Beckert's analysis of cotton's global history reveals a profound theological insight: capitalism's early formations were fundamentally about controlling and extracting human bodies, not just economic exchange. This mirrors the theological mutations I describe in MAGA Christianism - a system that transforms Christian identity into a mechanism of power and control.

Key Theological Observations:
- Capitalism's initial formation resembles what I call "practical atheism" - a system that claims neutrality while fundamentally reorganizing human relationships through violence
- The cotton economy demonstrates how economic systems can create theological narratives that justify domination
- Slavery and land expropriation functioned as "sacraments" of white supremacy, creating a perverse liturgy of extraction

### Divine Providence Weaponized

Plantation owners and merchants repeatedly invoked divine providence to legitimate their economic violence. This parallels MAGA Christianism's use of biblical language to sanctify nationalist and economic agendas. As Beckert notes, merchants and planters saw themselves as executing a divine plan while systematically destroying human communities.

### Practices of Dehumanization

The cotton economy required continuous theological and cultural work to render human beings as commodities. This mirrors the "binary apocalypticism" I critique - a worldview that divides humanity into those who matter and those who can be sacrificed.

## Theological Alternatives

### Covenantal Economic Imagination

Against the extractive logic of war capitalism, we need a theological vision of economic life grounded in:
- Mutual flourishing
- Recognizing the imago dei in every person
- Economic practices that embody trinitarian love (self-giving without domination)

### Repentance and Repair

The cotton economy's legacy demands not just historical acknowledgment but active theological reconstruction. This requires:
- Liturgical practices of lament
- Economic models of genuine reciprocity
- Reimagining property and ownership through the lens of God's generative abundance

## Methodological Insights

Beckert's work demonstrates how apparently "neutral" economic systems are always deeply theological - they represent particular imagination about human nature, divine order, and social possibility.

The cotton economy reveals how Christian practices can be simultaneously explicit (prayer, worship) and implicit (economic violence justified through religious language).

### Practical Recommendations

1. Develop liturgical practices that explicitly name and resist economic systems built on extraction
2. Create educational resources connecting economic history with theological formation
3. Support economic models that prioritize human dignity over profit

### Theological Keywords
- Coercion
- Extraction
- Commodification
- Liturgies of Violence
- Theological Imagination

The Empire of Cotton offers a profound case study in how theological distortions enable systemic violence - a critical lens for understanding MAGA Christianism's theological mutations.
