### Highlights

- Isaiah Berlin was writing in 1958, and his model was widely read as applying to the competing ideologies of the Cold War. Social scientists took it up with high enthusiasm, but philosophers and historians have not been happy with it. Eric Foner observes from long study that most ideas of liberty and freedom in America have tended to be positive and negative at the same time. Further, as we shall see, many ideas of liberty and freedom are larger than “noninterference with my own activity” or “being one’s own master.” Isaiah Berlin’s “two concepts of liberty” are heuristically useful, but they are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive. As organizing categories for the study of liberty and freedom they are mistaken. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=78))
- Eric Foner’s Story of American Freedom takes a different and more historical approach to the problem. He begins with an idea of freedom as an “essentially contested concept,” in W. B. Gallie’s phrase, and studies it as a sequence of controversies that have shaped American history. The result is an excellent and large-spirited book, one of the best on its subject. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=83))
- Most Americans do not think of liberty and freedom as a set of texts, or a sequence of controversies, or a system of abstractions. They understand these ideas in another way, as inherited values that they have learned early in life and deeply believe. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=91))
- The only scholar who attempted to study the subject in this light was Alexis de Tocqueville. He observed that liberty and freedom were habitudes du coeur, “habits of the heart.” He called them moeurs libres, by which he meant customs, beliefs, traditions, and folkways of free people.9 Tocqueville believed that liberty and freedom as “habits of the heart” had a special importance in the United States, more so than in other nations.

- question is, ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=99))
- A leading scholar of other cultures, Orlando Patterson, observes that “non-western peoples have thought so little about freedom that most human languages did not even possess a word for the concept before contact with the west.” ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=104))
- A case in point was Hammurabi’s Code. One leading student of that text was surprised to find “no special designation for a free man.” There were many references to slaves, but the opposite of “slave” was not “free.” It was “master,” who was himself in thrall to a higher power.12 Other ancient cultures were even more distant from ideas of liberty or freedom. Most were governed by tyrants, in the Greek sense of an absolute ruler whose will is law. The Greeks had a saying that in a tyranny only one person is free. In such a world, freedom as a general principle is difficult even to imagine. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=107))
- Our English word liberty comes from the Latin libertas and its adjective liber, which meant unbounded, unrestricted, and released from restraint. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=116))
- A synonym was solutus, from the verb solvo, to loosen a set of bonds. These words were similar to the Greek eleutheria and eleutheros, which also meant the condition of being independent, separate, and distinct.15 The Greeks used these terms to describe autonomous cities, independent tribes, and individuals who were not ruled by another’s will. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=117))
- Freedom has another origin. It derives from a large family of ancient languages in northern Europe. The English word free is related to the Norse fri, the Germany frei, the Dutch vrij, the Flemish vrig, the Celtic rheidd, and the Welsh rhydd. These words share an unexpected root. They descend from the Indo-European priya or friya or riya, which meant dear or beloved. The English words freedom and free have the same root as friend, as do their German cousins… ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=123))
- A very similar meaning also appeared in the Sumerian ama-ar-gi, the oldest known word for anything like liberty or freedom, which appeared on clay tablets in Lagash before 2300 B.C. Ama-ar-gi came from the verb ama-gi, which meant literally going home to mother. It described the… ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=128))
- In that respect, the original meanings of freedom and liberty were not merely different but opposed. Liberty meant separation. Freedom implied connection. A person with libertas in Rome or eleutheria in ancient Greece had been granted some degree of autonomy, unlike a slave. A person who had Freiheit in northern Europe or ama-ar-gi in southern… ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=131))
- The Roman idea of libertas as emancipation and independence has been studied at length by modern scholars.20 The ancient idea of freedom as the rights of… ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=134))
- The free Norse families who colonized Iceland in the ninth century were refugees from kingship and oppression. They carried into a new world their ancient folkways of freedom, which they understood as a complex set of rights and responsibilities. For them, freedom meant the rule of law, the power to choose one’s own… ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=137))
- Icelanders also had an Althing for their entire island, which included a council of chiefs, a court of law, and a legislature, or Lögrétta. The Lögrétta was led by a Lögsögumadr, or lawspeaker, who was elected for three years. Each year the lawspeaker stood by the Lögberg, or law rock, and recited one-third of the laws from memory, before a highly critical audience of freemen. If the freemen did not agree, the lawspeaker summoned five lögmenn, or legal experts,… ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=143))
- By the eleventh century, most men in Iceland were born free. This prior condition of freedom was a birthright that all freemen shared.24 ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=152))
- In ancient Rome, the opposite was the case. Most people were born in a condition of prior restraint, to which liberty came as a specific exemption or release. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=153))
- A leading scholar concludes that “the Romans conceived of libertas as an acquired civil right, not as an innate right of man.”25 ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=156))
- This led to another difference between freedom and liberty. The freeborn people of northern Europe were alike in their birthright of freedom, however disparate they may have been in power, wealth, or rank. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=158))
- Among “folkfree” people, freedom created an element of equality in the face of other inequalities.27 The ancient rule was summarized by Frederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland: “All free men are equal before the law.” ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=160))
- In ancient Rome, liberty implied inequality. People were granted different liberties according to their condition. Some had many liberties. Others had few or none. When Rome was a republic, its citizens possessed the liberty of government by assembly, but in different ways according to their rank. Magistrates and senators had liberty to speak. Citizens had liberty to listen and vote. Servi had liberty to look on, but they could neither speak nor listen nor vote.29 ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=163))
- Roman libertas gave rise to a complex vocabulary of stratification and mobility that still echoes in modern English speech. The Latin adjective liberaliter meant knowing how to behave gracefully and generously, in the manner of a highborn person who is secure in the possession of many liberties. It is the root of our word liberality. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=166))
- The condition of libertas in the Mediterranean civilizations was in some ways more limited than freedom in northern Europe, but it had a longer reach through a larger population. Freedom in Iceland and North Europe was more complete as a social condition, but it was more narrowly confined within a smaller sphere. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=176))
- A careful student of this subject observes that libertas in Rome was “not an innate faculty or right of man” but the sum of liberties that had been “granted by the laws of Rome.”34 ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=185))
- A privilege or an immunity was something that might be given. A right was something that must be given. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=191))
- The gift of libertas and eleutheria brought with it an obligation to act in a wise and responsible way—not as a libertine. A person with liberty was responsible for his own acts. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=198))
- A person who was born to freedom in an ancient tribe had a sacred obligation to serve and support the folk, and to keep the customs of a free people, and to respect the rights of others on pain of banishment. In modern America too many people have forgotten this side of our inheritance. They think of liberty as license without responsibility, and freedom as entitlement without obligation. To think this way in the modern world is to remember only half of these ancient traditions. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=200))

- In another application, the teachings of Christ were taken in a different direction. They became the spiritual equivalent of North European freedom and came to mean a connectedness to Christ and an obligation to do His work in the world. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=212))
- German Protestants and English Puritans were raised in this Pauline tradition of Christianity. Martin Luther was working within it when he wrote Die Freiheit eines Christenmenschen, “The Freedom of a Christian Person” (1520), which was the freedom to work for Christ in the world and to be joined to him and even to become one with Him. This also brought a great responsibility to a believing Christian. Luther summarized his idea of freedom in two sentences: “A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.” ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=215))
- Martin Luther developed this idea in another way that showed the persistent power of an old folkway. He was troubled by the conflicts that his ideas had caused and argued that the freedom of a Christian should be understood as love for others: “Freiheit als Liebe,” freedom as love, a bond between believers and the loving gift of God. This idea became a major theme in Luther’s writing. It was taken up by Protestant reformers after him and has reverberated through the ages. Some of its strongest expressions appeared in English Puritan ideas of “soul freedom,” which meant the freedom that grew from unity with God and oneness with His Spirit. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=221))
- North European traditions centered on freedom as a form of belonging and rights of connection to a community of free people. They imply tribal membership, and the existence of inalienable rights among all freeborn people. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=230))
- The Mediterranean tradition of liberty is an idea of separation and independence. It is an idea of hierarchy, in the variable possession of privileges that might be given or taken away by a higher power. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=231))

- Liberty will refer to ideas of independence, separation, and autonomy for individuals or groups. Freedom will mean rights of belonging and full membership in a community of free people (whether a tribe, a nation, or humanity itself). The phrase “liberty and freedom” will also appear. It refers to the entire range of modern ideas that combine elements of these ancient ideas in many different forms. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=233))

- Every Western language has words such as liberty or freedom, but only one language employs them both in common speech. German, Dutch, and Scandinavian cultures have freedom but not liberty. Spanish, French, and Italian have liberty but not freedom. Philosopher Hannah Pitkin writes, “Speakers of English have a unique opportunity: they get to choose between ‘liberty’ and ‘freedom.’ No other European language, ancient or modern, offers such a choice.” ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=240))
- In 1649, King Charles I said defiantly of his subjects as they were about to cut off his head, “Truly, I desire their liberty and freedom as much as anybody whatsoever, but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government.” He used both words together in his last breath, but he was thinking mainly of a classical and hierarchical idea of libertas as specific privileges or exemptions that flowed from higher authority. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=249))
- Colonel Rainborough’s “liberty and freedom” meant the rights of all freeborn Englishmen and an idea of belonging to a community of free people. Here again, the use of “liberty and freedom” in one phrase was not a repetition for rhetorical effect. It engaged the entire heritage of English-speaking people in a single thought. Both Cavaliers and Roundheads laid claim to this dual legacy, with different ideas in mind. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=255))
- Altogether, English-speaking people invented many versions of liberty and freedom, which became folkways in their own right. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=275))
- But what did those old words mean in the New World? To follow this line of inquiry is to find an astonishing variety of beliefs about liberty and freedom in early English settlements. Another inquiry, published as Albion’s Seed (from which this work has grown), found evidence of at least four distinct ideas of liberty and freedom in Puritan New England, Cavalier Virginia, Quakers in the Delaware Valley, and North British borderers in the American backcountry. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=285))
- Captain Preston and his comrades envisioned their ideas of liberty and freedom. They tended to represent their visions in the form of symbols and images. A symbol might be understood as a vehicle for thinking and as a device for transporting thought from one mind to another. More than that, an image does not merely communicate a vision. It can also create it, transform it, and persuade others to adopt it. Some images take on the character of sacred objects. When that happens, symbols become icons, which not merely signify but sanctify thought. They are regarded with reverence and protected from pollution. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=299))
- In 1775, they were one of the first armies in history in which most of the rank and file were literate. Nearly all American images of liberty and freedom were invented by literate people. In their symbols, words and images often appeared together and became mutually explanatory. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=304))
- all of these stories come together in a larger story. It will be told here with several narrative lines, all braided together. One is about the continuing importance of liberty and freedom in all American generations. Another is about multiple meanings in every generation, and contested meanings in most. A third is about change and growth, as every American generation has enlarged the meaning of liberty and freedom. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=319))

- What made America free, and keeps it growing more so, was not any single vision of liberty and freedom but the interplay of many visions. Together, these many ideas made America more free than any one American ever was, or wished to be. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=323))

- one. It is curious that James Pike thought of liberty as a tree. This is not a symbol that comes to modern minds, but it was popular in New England. To seek its origin is to find an old tradition of liberty and freedom, one of many that flourished in early America. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=337))
- Stitched to the bottom of the boot was a bright green sole. Green had long been the color of liberty and freedom in English folklore, since the day of Robin Hood and his Green Men in the fourteenth century. Rural rebels in Kent and East Anglia wore sprigs of greenery in their caps during the sixteenth century. The first English Whigs (as friends of liberty and freedom were called) organized themselves as the Green Ribbon Club in the seventeenth century. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=350))
- All of them would be liable for stamp taxes of two pounds on any school diploma, four pounds on any militia commission, and six pounds on “any grant of any liberty, privilege or franchise.” Liberty itself was taxed by the new Stamp Act, which was more than a revenue measure. It was a crude attempt at social engineering by British leaders who believed that the American colonies had too many newspapers, schools, lawyers, and liberties.9 ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=370))
- Here was a New England vision of “publick liberty,” combined with “personal security, personal liberty and private property.” It was a combination of collective rights and individual responsibilities, very different from our modern ideas of collective responsibility and individual entitlement.12 ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=382))
- They called it a Liberty Tree, not a Freedom Tree. The logic of this movement against Parliament led the Revolutionary generation to speak mostly of liberty in its classical sense of separation. Boston’s town-born men understood that idea in terms of both individual rights of property and collective rights of self-government and the rule of law, which Samuel Adams called “the liberty of Boston,” “the liberty of New England,” and “the liberty of America.” ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=402))
- Liberty Trees appeared in Cambridge, Petersham, Roxbury, Norwich, Newport, Providence, and many other towns. In southeastern New England some were buttonwoods. Connecticut preferred oaks. Boston, Providence, Roxbury, and Cambridge chose elms. Whatever the species, New England’s Liberty Trees were giants of old growth, deeply rooted in the soil of the New World. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=414))
- From the beginning, Bostonians saw no contradiction between a fierce defense of their own rights and the persecution of aliens and dissenters. That attitude had appeared in the banishment of Roger Williams, the exile of Anne Hutchinson, and the hanging of Quaker missionary Mary Dyer. It persisted into the American Revolution, and Loyalists became the leading victims. In Boston, the place of persecution was the Liberty Tree. It was a site for rituals of humiliation that Peter Oliver (brother of Andrew) called “the Tree Ordeal.” ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=492))
- The Sons of Liberty of Boston did not have a liberal attitude toward their opponents. This New England town had a tribal spirit that was often xenophobic, sometimes anti-Catholic, and occasionally anti-Semitic. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=506))
- In the Old World, liberty was symbolized as something new, fresh, and fragile. In the New World it was thought to be old, tough, and very tenacious. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=551))
- All of these Puritan symbols had been used by Cromwell’s New Model Army in the English Civil Wars. They became part of New England’s complex imagery of liberty and freedom: old trees and ancient vines, divine hands and throbbing hearts, chains of unity and anchors of salvation, swords of righteousness and appeals to heaven. These elements shared a similar spirit. They were plain and very austere, without intricate motifs or classical embellishments. By 1775 they were folk symbols, firmly rooted in New England’s ancestral ways. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=594))
- Together, they symbolized an old New England vision that had many names. John Cotton called it “well ordered liberty.” Francis Higginson knew it as “soul freedom” and Nathaniel Ward as “free liberty.” John Winthrop defined it as “civil or federal liberty to do that only which is good, just or honest.”54 It was a carefully balanced idea of individual and collective rights. John Wise began by proclaiming, “I shall consider every Man in a state of natural Being, as a Free-Born subject under the Crown of Heaven, and owing Homage to none but God himself.” But he added quickly, “This Liberty does not consist in a loose or ungovernable Freedom, or in an unbounded license of Acting. . . . They alone live as they Will, who have learnt what they ought to Will.” ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=600))
- In New England minds, this vision of liberty and freedom was entirely consistent with the persecution of Quakers and Tories and others who challenged the “common liberty” and “publick liberty.” ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=606))
- In 1766, these two small colonial seaports were much alike in their material condition, but far apart in their culture and history. Boston was still dominated by descendants of English Puritans who founded tight communities, shared a strong sense of ordered liberty and freedom, and fiercely defended their ancestral ways against outsiders. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=618))
- New York City had long been home to many ethnic groups, and by 1766 all of them were cultural minorities: old Dutch and new English, Germans and French, Irish and Scots, Moravians and Huguenots, a flourishing Jewish community, and one of the largest urban African populations in the New World. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=620))
- New York’s tradition of pluralism began with its Dutch founders early in the seventeenth century. It combined a policy of official toleration with intense ethnic rivalry and bitter religious conflict. Bonds within ethnic groups tended to be close and warm, but relations between them were distant and hostile. These patterns appeared as early as 1624 and still persist in New York City, which for sixteen generations has been a place of extreme ethnic diversity, conflicted class relations, turbulent politics, intense economic competition, enormous energy, abrasive manners, and abusive speech. In all of these ways, Manhattan in the twenty-first century is remarkably similar to descriptions of old New York in the eighteenth century, New Amsterdam in the seventeenth century, and even old Amsterdam in the sixteenth century. The urban folkways of New York City, for all its highly cultivated habit of historical amnesia, have strong linkages to a distant past. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=622))
- As early as the eighteenth century, New Yorkers shared a distinctive idea of liberty as the autonomy of groups, and of freedom as the right to belong to one’s own group within an open society. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=629))
- Some historians recognize the Independent Reflector for having made the first clear disjunction between “public” and “private” spheres. Livingston opposed “public aids” and “exclusive privileges” for “private parties” and “particular sects.” He called this idea “impartial equity” and was thinking of a free society as a plural system in which no group had a hegemony over other groups. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=632))
- These young men of New York were radical Whigs, extreme in their devotion to rights of liberty and property within an open society. They were hostile to entrenched elites and not much concerned about law and order. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=673))
- experiences, and the character of the town in which they lived. The symbolism of the Liberty Pole began with an ancient image that was familiar throughout the English-speaking world in the eighteenth century. Political cartoons on both sides of the Atlantic commonly represented liberty as a Roman goddess of libertas, a timeless figure of great dignity, dressed in a long garment called a stola and a cloak called a palla. She was distinguished from other Roman goddesses by the things she carried: a long wand called a vindicta in one hand, and a soft cap called a pileus in the other. As we have seen, both were symbols of emancipation. Roman slaves were released from bondage by a ritual in which a praetor touched them with his wand and gave them a stocking cap as a token of their liberty. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=680))
- Cartoonists reduced their defining elements to a simple sketch of a liberty cap on the tip of a long wand. By 1766, this image of libertas was so familiar throughout the English-speaking world that artists did not need to label ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=689))
- It is interesting that New Yorkers chose the classical symbol of libertas as independence, autonomy, and separation. Their emblem was different from New England’s trees and vines and rings and chains that expressed a more organic idea of liberty and freedom as something that belonged to a tightly knit community. The Liberty Pole had a meaning that suited the condition of New York, where many ethnic groups lived side by side but never quite together. Their strongest bond was a common desire for liberty to keep their own customs, to worship in their way, and to be secure in their property. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=701))
- It was no accident that New Yorkers invented the modern Liberty Pole and that Bostonians created the Liberty Tree. These emblems represented different visions of a free society, well matched to the communities that called them into being. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=830))
- Like his father, he was devoted to what he called the “Quaker cause” and the “cause of liberty and the rights derived to us by our charter and our laws.”95 In 1751 the younger Norris persuaded the Pennsylvania Assembly to commission a great bell as an enduring symbol of that idea. He recommended that the bell should be ordered from England, inscribed with a suitable inscription about liberty, and hung in the State House, where it would call the Assembly into session and remind the people of their liberties. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=888))
- The Assembly liked the idea. In 1750, exactly 75 percent of its members belonged to the Society of Friends.96 The bell was very much a Quaker project, and it symbolized their values and purposes. Isaac Norris junior also chose the words for its inscription, and wrote it in his own hand: “Proclaim liberty thro’ all the land to all the Inhabitants thereof.” Norris took his text from the Bible. The verse in Leviticus 25:10 ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=892))
- Here was a fitting passage for the fiftieth anniversary of Pennsylvania’s Charter of Privileges. It also summarized a Quaker vision of liberty and freedom, which was different from beliefs in New England and New York. This Quaker idea began with an idea of liberty as a gift of God. Other Christians shared that belief, but Quakers understood it in a special way. They thought of it as an “inner light” that was given to all His children, not merely to the “elect,” as Calvinists imagined, or to members of an established church, as Anglicans and Roman Catholics insisted. Quakers believed that this inner light dwelled within all Gods creatures. Sometimes they spoke of it as the light of liberty.

- Further, Quakers believed that God had given this gift for a purpose, so that His people might live in peace, and not oppress one another, and do His work of goodness and mercy in the world. This Quaker idea embraced everyone and bound them to treat others as they would wish to be treated. A central principle for the Society of Friends was the Golden Rule, which they regarded as a practical guide to the conduct of daily affairs. It held the promise of equality in the special sense of an evenhanded reciprocity of rights and Christian obligations.

- This large-minded vision of liberty and freedom was strong among the radical Protestants who settled the Delaware Valley. In Pennsylvania, West Jersey, and what is now Delaware, they genuinely tried to put it to work. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=910))
- The Quakers were among the few people in the world who extended to others the rights that they claimed for themselves. Their thinking was very different from the Puritan conception of ordered liberty and freedom for the Calvinist elect of New England, and even further from the unruly pluralism of New York.

- These men represented a small elite of Virginian gentlemen who had ruled their “Ancient Dominion,” as they liked to call it, for more than a century. Their ancestors had been younger sons of English gentry and aristocracy, who emigrated to Virginia in the mid-seventeenth century. Their families were Anglican in religion, Royalist in politics during the English Civil War, and shared a pride of rank and ancestry, with coats of arms on file at the College of Heralds in London. In Virginia they became landowners, slavekeepers, and officeholders, and members of a close-linked cousinage who shared common interests and values. Even as much of their wealth rested on slavery, they had a highly developed sense of their own liberty and freedom. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1034))
- In a great arc around the central figures of Libertas, Ceres, and Aeternitas, they ordered that “In the exergon, these words appear: DEUS NOBIS HAEC OTIA FECIT,” or “God has granted us this leisure.” The operative word was otium, which had a complex meaning in classical Latin. It could be translated both as “leisure” and “independence.” Liberty, in the minds of these Virginia gentlemen, was closely identified with those ideas. It meant a release from the tyranny of toil and liberty from dependence on another’s will. It signified not so much the reality of a Chesapeake planter’s life but rather its driving ideal. These men aspired to the condition of an independent gentleman who was the lord of his plantation, patriarch of his “people,” ruler of his county, and master of his time. In this coupling of libertas and otium, liberty and leisure and independence all became one. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1058))
- In the Chesapeake colonies, libertas and otium were granted to people in different degrees, according to their station. Independent gentlemen were given many liberties and much leisure. Small farmers and tenants had less of both. Indentured servants possessed few liberties, and slaves had none. Liberty and leisure and independence were only for those who were allowed “to enter into a state of society,” as George Mason carefully put it in his draft of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights. The soaring phrases in that document were meant to apply to some Virginians but not others. Here was a very powerful idea of liberty that coexisted comfortably with slavery.

- For us this idea of liberty and freedom is a contradiction in terms, because we no longer share the assumptions of hierarchy on which it rests. But among the gentlemen of Virginia, and many others in their time, differences of social rank and condition were widely accepted and deeply believed. Similar ideas of hierarchy were widely shared by ruling elites throughout the Western world. In that respect, Virginia’s hierarchical idea of liberty was also very similar to Roman libertas. But it was very far removed from the Puritan heritage of… ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1071))
- This tradition of liberty and freedom was established in Virginia during the seventeenth century. Chief among its many carriers was Sir William Berkeley (1606–77), a pivotal figure in the history of Virginia and its governor off and on from 1640 to 1677. Sir William Berkeley encouraged the migration of younger sons from Royalist families of the aristocracy and gentry. This small Cavalier elite arrogated to itself the wealth and power of Virginia and ruled the colony for many generations. It dominated the Royal Council of Virginia,… ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1078))
- Sir William Berkeley and his small elite envisioned Virginia as a Cavalier utopia that would be Anglican in religion, hierarchical in its social relations, and governed by gentlemen of honor, courage, and breeding. This idealized society required large numbers of people who were willing to serve in lesser ranks, a role for which there were few volunteers.

- It is certainly not correct, as some historians have written, that American freedom rose from American slavery.119 But it is true that one American vision of liberty and freedom coexisted with slavery and even called it into being. “How is it,” Doctor Samuel Johnson asked, “that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of… ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1087))

He said of Virginia and Carolina, “A circumstance attending these colonies . . . makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the northward.

- In 1776, Thomas Jefferson was asked to help with the engraving of the great seal, with its imagery of libertas and otium. So powerful was the ethic of otium in the Ancient Dominion that when the Virginia Convention voted to make an engraving of their design, the nearest industrious artisan who was able to do the work lived in Philadelphia.122 In hope of finding an engraver there, the design was sent to Jefferson, in the Continental Congress. He showed it to colleagues from other states and was “mortified” by their reaction, as Virginia gentlemen liked to say. Some… ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1101))
- Despite Jefferson’s doubts, the design was endorsed by more than a hundred members in the Virginia Convention of 1776 and speedily adopted as the state seal. It was blazoned on its regimental flags, engraved upon its currency, and minted on its Indian medals.124 But the part of the design that drew Adams’s ridicule and Jefferson’s displeasure became increasingly troublesome. The linkage between libertas and otium might have made sense to the gentlemen of Virginia in the heady days of 1775 and early 1776. But as the colonial rebellion became a social revolution, that hierarchical idea of liberty made no sense at all to people who lived outside the narrow circle of the Cavalier elite. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1115))
- And as the long struggle wore on, otium seemed scarcely the word even for those weary few who were running the state of Virginia. In the dark days of 1779, Thomas Jefferson became governor of Virginia, and he succeeded at last in changing the state seal, quietly replacing otium with perseverando. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1120))
- But even with that change, Virginia’s idea of liberty remained an expression of inequality and hierarchy for many in its ruling class. John Randolph of Roanoke gave it a classic expression when he said, “I am an aristocrat; I love liberty, I hate equality.” ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1127))
- To those who did not share this way of thinking, Virginia’s hierarchical idea of hegemonic liberty seemed false and even hypocritical, increasingly so as it faded into the past.

- It was the color of indigo, one of the leading crops of the Carolina lowcountry. In the upper corner of the flag was a large white crescent of distinctive shape. Here was yet another emblem of liberty in the American Revolution, and a symbol unique to the Carolina lowcountry. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1144))
- Carolina’s crescent flag of liberty was designed by Colonel William Moultrie, commander of the fort that bore his name. ([Location 1147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1147))
- Why a crescent? What did that symbol mean to Colonel Moultrie and the Carolinians who adopted it for their emblem of liberty? Why did it become popular in their colony? ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1171))
- More often, the horns were bent in a third direction, toward the wearer’s right, in a crescent dexter, or increscent, which was an emblem of courage and victory. In British heraldry, the crescent dexter also took on another meaning: it became the distinguishing mark of a younger son. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1180))
- This heraldic emblem of the younger son had a personal meaning for Carolina families, many of which were founded by younger sons. William Moultrie himself was the younger son of a younger son of an armigerous Scottish family. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who wore an increscent on his helmet, also came from the line of a younger son who came to America in search of land that was denied to him because of his birth. ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1190))
- The same thing happened in Virginia, where the Cavaliers who dominated that colony also tended to be younger sons. The most important of them, Sir William Berkeley, was a younger son who deliberately recruited many others of the same station. Richard Lee, founder of the Lee family in America, brought his coat of arms with him and proudly displayed it in a wood carving that was mounted above the front entrance of Stratford Plantation. Worked into the design was a heraldic crescent that signified the second-born son. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1193))
- Colonel Moultrie’s crescent flag combined many of these meanings. It preserved the associations of the “honourable ordinary” as an ancient sign of faith and a chivalric emblem of courage, honor, and chivalry. As a crescent dexter it was also a heraldic badge of rank that described the origins and memories of men such as William Moultrie and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and the dreams of dispossessed younger sons. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1196))
- The flag itself also made the crescent a symbol of liberty. In South Carolina, this was an idea with a special meaning. It had nothing to do with equality. Like the otium of Virginia’s ruling elite, it was hierarchical and hegemonic. It existed in a world where highborn people had many liberties and defended them fiercely. “Baseborn” folk had few liberties, and slaves had none at all. There was no contradiction if one accepted an assumption of inequality. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1202))
- The Carolina increscent had another significance. The Latin crescens meant growing or increasing. Like the crescent of a waxing moon, it was a symbol of prosperity and growth. More than that, these meanings were also associated with opportunity and fortune. It became an emblem of success in the present and optimism for the future. It implied that better times lay ahead. This expansive image of Carolina crescent-liberty was a little different from Virginia visions of a Cavalier utopia. But, as we shall see, a symbol of optimism would become a common American association with liberty and freedom.

- We think of the West as the frontier, the forward edge of change in American history. But in the eighteenth century it was called the backcountry, and it was thought to be the most remote and isolated region in the colonies. The news of Lexington took nearly a month to get there. When it arrived, the back-settlers instantly perceived the fighting to be a struggle for their own liberty and freedom. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1262))
- For its colors, Captain Proctor’s Battalion chose a new symbol of liberty and freedom. They carried a big crimson flag, made of heavy watered silk, six feet four inches broad by five feet ten inches high. It still survives at the Pennsylvania Museum in Harrisburg. ([Location 1268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1268))
- In the center of the flag, where a dignified regimental crest and Latin motto would normally appear, the backsettlers of Westmoreland County substituted a huge rattlesnake, thirty-six by forty-two inches, painted yellow-brown with dark cross-bands. The image was drawn with such accuracy that its subspecies can be identified as a timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), which, like the men who carried the flag, inhabited the wooded mountains and rocky hills of the Appalachian highlands. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1272))
- The Westmoreland men gave their rattlesnake a set of thirteen rattles, with a fourteenth beginning to form in the hope that Canada would join the cause. Beneath the rattlesnake was a blunt motto: “Don’t Tread on Me.” ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1279))
- Another rattlesnake flag was adopted by the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment, which had been raised in 1775. It was recruited throughout the colony, but the leading authority writes that “frontier areas had a disproportionately heavy representation.” Its second battalion came mostly from Lancaster, Cumberland, Northumberland, York, and Westmoreland counties and drew largely from North British and Ulster families. The colonel of the regiment was Walter Stewart, also of North British descent. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1284))
- Yet a third backcountry rattlesnake flag may (or may not) have been adopted in Culpeper County, Virginia, on the east slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains, by a unit that called itself the Culpeper Minutemen. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1288))
- Part of the “savage-looking equipments” may have been their flag. A sketch of it by an historian in the mid-nineteenth century shows a design similar to the Westmoreland Independent Battalion’s: the dark image of a timber rattlesnake, coiled and ready to strike, and the words “Don’t Tread on Me.” Also on the flag was another motto, which also appeared in large white letters on their hunting shirts: “Liberty or Death.” Their leader was Patrick Henry, who became colonel of the First Virginia Regiment, to which the Culpeper Minutemen were attached. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1294))
- The rattlesnake symbol had two associations of particular importance. One was with the new American navy. In Congress a member of the marine committee, Christopher Gadsden, a South Carolina merchant who was the son of a British naval officer, proposed a yellow flag with a rattlesnake and “Don’t Tread on Me” as the ensign of the Continental Navy. It was flown at sea in early 1776. Rattlesnakes were carved on the sterns of warships in the Continental Navy, which was sometimes called “the rattlesnake squadron.” They were painted on the drums of the United States Marines. Gadsden also recommended a rattlesnake flag to the state of South Carolina, and its ships sometimes displayed an ensign with a rattlesnake stretched across a field of red and blue stripes. The flag was actively used, and in the mid-twentieth century the oldest ship in the United States Navy was authorized to fly a rattlesnake flag from its jackstaff. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1309))
- The strongest association was with the backcountry. This vast area of forested mountains and fertile valleys was dotted with new settlements in 1775. Most adults who lived there were not natives of the region. These backsettlers specially favored the rattlesnake emblem and were strongly drawn to the motto “Don’t Tread on Me.” How and why it was chosen is a story with more twists than a serpent’s tail. To seek its origin is to find yet another vision of liberty and freedom in early America. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1315))
- After the fighting began in 1775, the serpent became a rattlesnake and its symbolism changed in many ways. The serpent had been a generic European creature; the rattlesnake was an American species, unique to the New World. The European serpent had looked very weak and desperately wounded, even on the edge of death; the American rattlesnake was strong, healthy, and dangerous. His fangs were bared, his rattles were erect, and he was tightly coiled and ready to strike. Most important, the European serpent was an emblem of unity; the American rattlesnake became a symbol of liberty. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1344))
- To observers from other cultures, it seemed a strange choice for a sacred emblem. Not many people have chosen to represent their most cherished principle as a poisonous reptile. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1348))
- But Whigs rallied to the defense of the rattlesnake, with arguments that may help to explain why it was so popular among the British borderers who settled in the American backcountry. A writer in the Pennsylvania Journal explained, “The rattlesnake is solitary, and associates with her kind only when it is necessary for their preservation.” He added that the rattlesnakes eye “excelled in brightness that of every other animal, and that she has no eyelids. She may, therefore, be esteemed an emblem of vigilance.” He added that the rattlesnake “never begins an attack, nor, once engaged, ever surrenders. She is, therefore, an emblem of magnanimity and true courage.” Moreover, he argued that a rattlesnake “never wounds till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.” ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1354))
- The solitary rattlesnake symbolized liberty of a special kind. The motto summarized it in a sentence: “Don’t tread on me.” This was the only early American emblem of liberty and freedom to be cast in the first person singular. Here was an image of personal liberty, very different from the collective symbols of belonging that were widely used in New England but much like other backcountry expressions of liberty. The leading example was Patrick Henry’s famous cry: “Give me liberty!” It also warned the world, “Leave me alone, let me be, keep your distance, don’t tread on my turf.” ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1361))
- This was an idea that had a strong appeal to settlers in the American backcountry, and especially to settlers who came from the borders of North Britain.

- The British borderers brought to America a fierce attachment to liberty, which they understood in that special way. Natural liberty meant the right of individual settlers to be left alone, especially by governments who had brought them nothing but misery and exploitation. It also encouraged an idea of order as lex talionis, the rule of retaliation. Many centuries of violence had also created a warrior ethic in North Britain and northern Ireland.

- The people of Charlotte took Cornwallis’s words as a badge of honor and made the hornet’s nest their own special symbol of liberty and freedom. An old North Carolina liberty banner showed a hornet’s nest above the date May 20, 1775, for the Mecklenberg Declaration of Independence. Here was another symbol of natural liberty, very much like the rattlesnake in its meaning. A hornet, like a rattlesnake, was a creature that was not to be feared unless it was disturbed in its own home. It attacked to protect its territory. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1393))

- It is widely believed in America that western attitudes are a spontaneous product of the West itself, as if Daniel Boone smote the good earth of Kentucky with the stock of his long rifle and up sprang the American frontiersman. But before the West became the “frontier” it was the “back-country,” and the largest group of its inhabitants came from North Britain. Their idea of natural liberty was not invented in America. It derived from the ancient folkways of the British borderlands and flourished in the American backsettlements. The rattlesnake flag, with its motto “Don’t Tread on Me,” was a perfect symbol for this idea of natural liberty, and for a people who wished to be at a distance from government and free to go their own way.

- In 1775, more than 96 percent of African Americans were slaves. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1432))
- Among slaves, liberty always had one great meaning: the end of slavery itself. In the southern colonies, that idea inspired an underground iconography of liberty as emancipation. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1441))
- Above the Mason-Dixon line another pattern prevailed. In the northern colonies 95 percent of African Americans were slaves in 1775. Most supported the Revolution because they believed that it would bring them emancipation, and they were right. On the day of Lexington and Concord, many slaves mustered with the Middlesex militia and fought against the Regulars. Within a few years, all were free.167 In the northern colonies as a whole, the proportion of African Americans who were free increased from about 5 percent in 1775 to 56 percent in 1800, 74 percent by 1810, and 99 percent by 1840.168 ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1465))
- GERMAN AMERICANS are today the largest ethnic group in the United States, and the least distinct as a cultural entity. In the Census of 1990, nearly 25 percent of Americans reported that they were of German ancestry, more than any other group by a large margin. That survey found the number of Americans of German origin to be nearly double the number of Irish Americans and greater than African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans, Islamic Americans, and American Indians combined. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1508))
- In the eighteenth century, a mass migration of nearly half a million Germans was set in motion by religious persecution in central Europe and by a religious revival that the Germans called pietismus, similar to the Great Awakening in America and the Evangelical Movement in Britain. Many German sects shared ideas of Geistfreiheit, or soul freedom, that were similar to those of English Quakers. These beliefs still flourish among Amish and Mennonite settlements in Pennsylvania and the Middle West, to the tenth generation. Strong currents of pietism also brought many German Calvinists and Lutherans to America, in search of religious liberty and soul freedom. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1520))
- Most German immigrants in the eighteenth century had yet another vision of freedom. They were peasants and farm workers who shared neither the communal Geistfreiheit of the pietistic sects nor the Vogelfreiheit of the rootless wanderers nor the Bürgerrecht of city people. The peasants, or Bauernvolk, of middle Europe were driven by an idea oí Freiheit that grew from the suffering that had long been visited upon them in Europe. They came to America as refugees from a system of oppression that took many forms: religious conformity, compulsory military service, frequent wars, ruinous taxes, rapacious landlords, tyrannical princes, local bullies, and arrogant elites. Many fled the fatherland to be free of these afflictions. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1532))
- At the same time that they wished to be free, these German peasants also had an exceptionally strong sense of order. Their households were patriarchal, authoritarian, and highly disciplined. They dreamed of Freiheit von and Freiheit zu together, a freedom that would allow them to establish their own way of life in security and peace. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1538))
- Here was an idea of Freiheit von and Freiheit zu in the same thought. It meant freedom from fear and freedom from war. At the same time, it was about the freedom of close-knit families and friends to live in peace with one another, secure in their property and their domestic autonomy. This idea was not political in the usual sense, but antipolitical. It sought freedom from governments, wars, taxes, and dynastic ambitions of powerful princes and great states. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1549))
- Its dream of “everyone under his vine and under his fig tree” was an image of a world without violence, very different from the bellicose ways of British borderers but similar in a desire to be left alone by governments. Like the rattlesnake banners, this German vision referred to individuals and families rather than communities. The slogan that accompanied the image of the fig tree was cast in the singular—each under his fig tree. The German longing for the autonomy of highly disciplined families was different both from the natural liberty of North British borderers and the ordered liberty of New Englanders. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1553))
- Like many ideas of liberty and freedom, this German vision of Feigenbaumfreiheit was in some ways at war with itself. It demanded a system of government that was strong enough to preserve property, keep the peace, build roads, and preserve free markets, but it resented governors and resisted the taxes that governments require. An attitude of alienation from the state has persisted for many generations among German Americans, even to our own time. It would make them Democrats in the age of Jefferson and Jackson, and Republicans in the era of Reagan and Bush.

- All of these German ideas of freedom and liberty, different as they may have been from one another, shared at least one quality that set them apart from the thinking of English-speaking people. British Americans thought of the world as fundamentally free. They wished to preserve ancestral rights and fought the Revolution to keep what they had. Immigrants from central Europe thought of the world as fundamentally unfree and came to America in search of freedom that had been denied to most people in Europe. In that respect, they were like other non-English-speaking immigrants. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1561))
- Historians have challenged the primacy of Locke’s books in the philosophy of the American Revolution, but Philadelphia’s furniture makers had no doubt of his central role. The same pattern of Locke’s primacy also appeared in the books that filled these cases. In libraries and book lists throughout the colonies, the writings of John Locke appeared more often than the work of any other modern author. Locke dominated the book collections of eighteenth-century America, just as his image dominated the finial busts on the bookcases themselves.

- JOHN ADAMS reckoned that two-thirds of Americans supported the Revolution and one-third opposed it.191 Both groups came to be remembered by names their enemies gave them: Whigs and Tories. Whig was originally a term of insult for Scottish Presbyterian cattle thieves and rebels who were hostile to Catholic princes. Tory was a word of abuse for Irish Catholic robber gangs who preyed upon Protestant neighbors. In the late seventeenth century, both words began to be used in English politics for enemies and supporters of the Catholic Stuarts. By 1775, Americans adopted them for foes and friends of their Revolution. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=1739))
- Whigs, as we have seen, had many visions of these ideas. Tories had mostly one. They called themselves Loyalists and thought of liberty and freedom as the rule of law under the mixed or balanced government of king-in-Parliament, which they believed to be the freest system in the world.

- picture of the sort of world we would like to see.” Every American statement of policy defined the Cold War as a world struggle for freedom and liberty, in ways that differed from the fight against Fascism in the Second World War. A new set of anti-Communist values began to form: democracy as free elections and the rule of law, capitalism as free enterprise, liberty as national independence and individual rights, and freedom as civil rights for all.

- Friedrich Hayek expressed amazement that American conservatives had allowed the left to claim the idea of liberty, and he decided to do something about it. In 1944, Hayek published a book called The Road to Serfdom, which argued that the new welfare-state liberalism was profoundly dangerous to liberty itself. He argued a simple thesis: that liberty is the right to be “free from coercion” and that economic planning by governments is its greatest enemy in the modern world. Hayek lumped together Fascism, Communism, socialism, and welfare-state liberalism. He insisted that their different ends mattered less than their common means, which he believed to be profoundly dangerous to a free society. ([Location 9788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9788))
- Hayek’s work was a vision of liberty as independence from big government and economic planning. It was also an idea of freedom as the right of every individual to participate without restraint in a free-market economy and an open society. ([Location 9795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9795))

- same. At least four major movements appeared on the right. They might be called libertarian conservatism, religious conservatism, racial conservatism, and militant conservatism.

- Within this common frame, there were many different conservative ideologies in America. Their agendas overlapped in detail, but each had its own distinct center. The most influential on public policy was libertarian conservatism. In America it went far beyond Hayek in demanding absolute freedom for capitalism, free markets, private ownership, minimal government, and very low taxes. In the 1960s, this way of thinking began to make converts among… ([Location 9807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9807))
- Another group with a very different set of goals were religious conservatives, who attracted strong popular support from evangelical Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox Jews, groups that were growing more rapidly than the general population. In some ways their purposes were opposed to libertarian conservatism. They demanded active government intervention to support their ideas of religion and morality. They wanted laws that regulated sexual behavior, forbade abortions, stopped the spread of contraception, and punished homosexuality as a crime. Some… ([Location 9814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9814))

- Another movement might be called militant conservatism. It centered on the right to keep and bear arms as a protection against criminals and even against government itself. It also valued the martial virtues of courage, honor, discipline, and service to the nation. Some of the most militant groups were small and very extreme, but a larger constituency of hunters and gun collectors strongly sympathized with these ideas and supported conservative candidates. Militant conservatism found strong support among… ([Location 9823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9823))
- A major purpose of these men was to wrest control of the Republican Party from moderate conservatives who had made their peace with the New Deal. The critical moment was the election of 1964, and the leader was Barry Goldwater. He lost the presidential election in that year, but his supporters gained control of the Republican Party. They developed a common conservative vision of liberty (more than freedom): free enterprise and minimal government in economics; active regulation on moral issues; and strict enforcement of law and order. They also gave strong support to religions of many denominations. ([Location 9833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=9833))
- politics. A major thrust of Goldwater conservatism was to separate individual American citizens from their own American government, and especially from the federal government. It returned to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, strict construction of the Constitution, and ideas of small government, even minimal government. The idea of government itself became a great evil. So strong did this habit of thought become that this historian heard President George Bush senior refer to the federal government and his own administration as “Them,” even while he lived in the White House.

- At the end of the twentieth century, some writers on the academic left lost interest in liberty and freedom. A few turned against these ideals, and tried to suppress free expression in the universities by imposing “speech codes” and a repressive regime of “political correctness” (an old Marxist term).

- In American politics, victory always went to the parties and leaders with the strongest and clearest visions of liberty and freedom, sometimes on the left and in other periods on the right. ([Location 11376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=11376))
- The First World War against European old regimes and the repressions of the Wilson administration led to a movement for liberty and democracy. The Second World War against Fascism inspired more attention to individual liberties in the Bill of Rights and more egalitarian visions of freedom. The Cold War against Communism reinforced visions of free enterprise, civil liberties, and civil rights. The War on Terror, and the secrecy and repression of the Bush administration, may (or may not) lead to a countermovement for the opening of secret institutions in government, business, and the Catholic church.

- In short, the history of liberty and freedom clearly fits a Whig model of American history. That idea became unfashionable in America during the late twentieth century, but the evidence is very clear. Through the span of four centuries, every American generation without exception has become more free and has enlarged the meaning of liberty and freedom in one way or another. ([Location 11408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=11408))
- What keeps America free is the diversity of its traditions of liberty and freedom. The tensions and contradictions in this heritage have inspired new visions of liberty and freedom and a great fertility of thought. The strength of this open system is its infinite variety.

- The gravest dangers to our free society are born-again apostles of one particular liberty and freedom who are incapable of imagining any way except their own.

- To study the modern history of other cultures is to discover that liberty and freedom are growing in many nations but never twice in the same way. As these ideas travel through the world, they change profoundly. Every nation (without exception) has created new visions of liberty and freedom, often by combining them with old customs and traditions.

- The art students completed the figure by adding a third element of American inspiration. They cut off the athlete’s pole and converted it to a torch inspired by the Statue of Liberty but held aloft in two upraised hands. The students combined Chinese, Russian, and American elements to create a new symbol that combined their own revolutionary vision of freedom, equality, and democracy with the two-handed Confucian and Daoist values of ancient China.

- The Goddess of Tiananmen Square, erected in Beijing on May 30, 1989, was not an imperfect copy of the Statue of Liberty, as many Americans believed, but a different vision that combined an American symbol of universal freedom with European ideas of social justice and elements of Chinese culture in a new vision of a free and open society.

- The people of India have a word for free: bindaas. It has a double meaning. An Indian writer defines bindaas as “unshackled and free to be.” He quotes a young Indian girl who says, “I am just happy to be bindaas in this great free country.” The people of India joined Western conceptions of freedom to this idea of bindaas. They created a new meaning for freedom by grafting modern ideas on the ancient roots of Indian civilization.

- Vivekananda joined Western ideas of freedom to his own Hindu faith. “Where is true independence?” Vivekananda asked. He answered, “It is not freedom of the senses; it is freedom from the senses.” He added, “He is free, he is great, who turns his back upon this world, who has renounced everything, who has controlled his passion, and who thirsts for peace. One may gain political independence, but if one is a slave to one’s passions and desires, one cannot feel the joy of real freedom.” ([Location 11504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=11504))
- Ambedkar is remembered and understood for many contributions to his nation. He played a major role in the design of India’s national flag, which he conceived as a symbol of freedom. It grew from Gandhi’s chakra flag, adopted by the All India Congress Committee in 1931, which displayed a simple domestic spinning wheel called the chakra, a symbol of freedom through self-reliance. It reminded the people of India that they could be free only by spinning their own thread and growing their own food. Gandhi’s chakra was set on three horizontal bands of color: saffron for Hindu, green for Moslem, and white for harmony. In 1947, the Assembly adopted the flag with one change. Ambedkar proposed that Gandhi’s spinning wheel or chakra should become the dharmachakra, the Buddhist wheel, taken from an ancient Sarnath Lion Capital. In Buddhist iconography it had many meanings. It was the wheel of law. ([Location 11548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=11548))

- Michnik called for another method of resistance—a revolution not to seize power by brute force but to change the relationship between society and the state. He proposed to break down the totalitarian system by nurturing “institutions of parallel society” and creating an idea of what he called “civil society.” Its object was to pry open a closed society by creating internal spaces within a totalitarian system. It was also to wear down a tyranny by constant erosion, like water dripping on stone. ([Location 11604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005FVPF90&location=11604))
- In 1980, the workers, the Church, and the intellectuals began to work together in a movement called Solidarity, a loose federation with many centers and millions of sympathizers throughout the country. In the spring of 1989, walls and kiosks displayed its vivid emblem: the simple word Solidarnosc, in bright red letters against a white background—the colors of Polish freedom and independence. When one looked closer, the letters of Solidarnosc became a procession of Polish people, moving freely together in a common cause.

- In these conversations, most Polish leaders were deeply devoted to ideas of liberty and freedom, for they had experienced life without them. But their visions of these ideals were far from American ways of thinking. Lech Walesa observed that “capitalism is not the best way of running things.”29 The Pope addressed the Polish parliament on June 11, 1999, and urged that there could be “no freedom without solidarity” and expressed strong belief in “the moral lessons of Solidarnosc” and the memory of a “Polish tradition” that offered values distinct both from Russian communism and American capitalism.
