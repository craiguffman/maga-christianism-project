# Synthesis Notes: Hospitality as Holiness for MAGA Christianism Project

## Key Theological Concepts for the Project

Luke Bretherton's "Hospitality as Holiness" provides several crucial theological frameworks that would enrich your critique of MAGA Christianism, particularly regarding how Christians should relate to others within pluralistic societies. Here are the most relevant theological concepts from the text that align with your book project's aims:

### Tolerance and Its Theological Grounding

Bretherton's work helps us understand tolerance not as moral relativism but as a crucial Christian virtue connected to justice. This provides theological resources to counter the binary apocalypticism you identify in MAGA Christianism:

"Tolerance is a moral virtue. It belongs to justice as one of its parts, and... regards operations as its matter, that is, it regards human actions that bear on the good of another, actions that set right our relations with them" (Location 2735).

This understanding of tolerance as virtue undermines the friend/enemy distinctions characteristic of MAGA Christianism. Unlike mere indifference or acceptance, true tolerance requires maintaining moral objection while still respecting human dignity and pursuing shared goods in common.

### Ad Hoc Commensurability vs. Systematic Incommensurability

MacIntyre's concept of tradition-constituted rationality is important for your project, but Bretherton notes a critical limitation:

"If MacIntyre's diagnosis [of incommensurability between traditions] is correct, then the conclusion seems to be that Christians and non-Christians cannot in any systematic way resolve their ethical disputes" (Location 937).

However, Bretherton argues for an "ad hoc commensurability" that allows for partial moral agreements across different traditions without requiring complete convergence:

"Success or failure in determining how traditions can relate as 'thick' moral discourses does not preclude... there being an ad hoc commensurability between the moral and social practices of Christians and non-Christians" (Location 2228).

This concept is vital for challenging MAGA Christianism's either/or political theology that sees no possibility of genuine moral discourse with those outside its tradition.

### Hospitality as Alternative to Binary Politics

Bretherton offers hospitality as a theological alternative to both relativistic tolerance and rigid intolerance:

"The practice of hospitality, as I have outlined more extensively elsewhere, is precisely a way of countering patronizing or excluding relations between strangers" (Location 2457).

"Hospitality refuses the political fantasy of neutral ground on which all may meet as equals" (Location 2459).

Hospitality acknowledges difference while making space for relationship - a crucial corrective to MAGA Christianism's tendency toward exclusion and enemy-making.

### The Saeculum and Political Judgment

Bretherton draws on Augustine's understanding of the saeculum - the time between Christ's ascension and return - as ambiguous and undetermined:

"For Augustine, politics in the saeculum is about enabling a limited peace that is on the one hand shorn of messianic pretensions but on the other not given over to demonic despair" (Location 2335).

This framework undermines both triumphalist Christian nationalism and reactionary apocalypticism by emphasizing the provisional and ambiguous nature of all political arrangements in this age.

## Methodological Insights for Your Project

### Analysis of Tolerance as Virtue

Bretherton's analysis of tolerance as virtue provides a methodological approach that could strengthen your critique of the moral failures of MAGA Christianism:

1. He distinguishes between true tolerance (virtue) and its semblances (indifference, acceptance, etc.)
2. He connects tolerance to justice and the common good rather than relativism
3. He shows how tolerance requires supporting virtues like patience and perseverance

This approach avoids dismissing concerns about moral relativism while still demonstrating the moral bankruptcy of binary friend/enemy politics.

### Attending to Power Dynamics in Encounters with Difference

Bretherton's work on hospitality attends carefully to power dynamics:

"The practice of hospitality is more often than not undertaken in a situation where one party is in a position of strength and the other in a position of vulnerability or weakness" (Location 3177).

This perspective would help your analysis of how MAGA Christianism functions to maintain certain power structures while claiming to be under threat.

### Analyzing Political Discourse Through Concentric Circles of Sociality

Bretherton offers a helpful framework for examining how political communities understand their obligations:

"Concentric circles of sociality thus constitute creaturely personhood in the image of God. However, the dynamics of neighbor love within these concentric circles of sociality are not like ripples in a pond, becoming weaker and weaker the further they move away from an animating center" (Location 4009).

This framework could help analyze how MAGA Christianism constructs its understanding of moral obligation and political community in ways that contradict Christian ethics.

## Practical Applications for Your Project

### Challenging Friend/Enemy Distinctions

Bretherton's work can help you articulate how Christians might relate to political differences without resorting to binary apocalypticism:

"The only criterion by which the church can accept or reject the thought and action of its neighbours is whether such thought and action accords with thought and action directed to God" (Location 5712).

This provides a more nuanced approach that evaluates political positions based on their alignment with divine justice rather than partisan loyalty.

### Hallowing "Bare Life" vs. Dehumanization

Bretherton's concept of "hallowing bare life" provides a powerful contrast to the dehumanizing tendencies in MAGA discourse:

"The involvement of churches with refugees should be characterized as the hallowing of bare life" (Location 3975).

"To hallow something means recognizing the irreducible worth of what is before one" (Location 3990).

This concept could help you articulate an alternative Christian political witness that recognizes human dignity across political, ethnic, and national divisions.

### Ecclesial Practices as Political Formation

Bretherton emphasizes how worship and ecclesial practices form Christians for political engagement:

"Through worship we are formed and empowered by the Spirit (the verbum internum) so that we may respond to this order faithfully, hopefully, and lovingly" (Location 2696).

"For the church listening is the constitutive political act" (Location 2735).

These insights provide practical alternatives to how churches might form political disciples in ways that resist the corruptions of MAGA Christianism.

## Conclusion

Bretherton's work on hospitality, tolerance, and Christian political witness provides substantial theological resources for your critique of MAGA Christianism. His nuanced understanding of how Christians can maintain their distinctive witness while still pursuing common goods with others offers a compelling alternative to the binary apocalypticism and tribal politics you identify in MAGA Christianism. His emphasis on hospitality as a specifically Christian political practice that neither withdraws from nor accommodates to the world provides a theological vision that could help reorient American Christianity toward a more faithful political witness.
