### Highlights

- It is very important for human knowledge that our concepts are stored in our memory and can be used in situations in which the object to which the concept applies is not here and now. We can judge that someone is courageous, dishonest, or priggish, or that a situation is dangerous, unfair, or offensive without feeling the emotions that correspond to each of those concepts. We need to make judgments of that kind in order to engage in moral reasoning and discourse with others, but when we do that, something is gained and something is lost. What is lost is motivational force. The process whereby the motivational force is sheared away from the judgment that originally expressed an emotion is what I call the thinning of moral judgment.I cannot see something as unjust without feeling indignant in the characteristic way that goes with injustice, but I can see or judge that something is unjust without feeling indignant. I cannot see someone as lovable without feeling love, but I can see that he is lovable without feeling love. When I judge that someone is lovable without feeling love, my judgment that the property applies depends upon a prior experience of love. Similarly, when I judge that something is red without having a red sensation, myjudgment that the property applies depends upon a prior experience of the sensation of red. When I make a judgment without the emotion or sensation, it is likely that I must still be able to imagine seeing something as lovable or as red, but even imagining requires a faint copy of the feeling of love and the sensation of red in my mind. (Hume makes this point convincingly at the beginning of the Treatise.) We need to be able to do this in order even to understand what is said when someone judges that something is red or lovable. Without a memory trace of the sensation or feeling, we cannot understand the judgment. ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2159))
- Typically, discussions of the issue of whether moral judgments are motivating take ought or duty judgments as examples, and the examples make it obvious that the judgments are what I call level 2 judgments. It is no wonder, then, that many theorists feel forced to deny that moral judgments are intrinsically motivating, since these are cases in which the judgments are made without the feeling of obligation. But I have argued that judgments made without emotion are not basic, so whereas they are not themselves motivating, they are derived from a class of judgments that are motivating. Moral discourse would be impossible without judgments that have been thinned of affectivity. But even thin judgmentstypically retain a degree of motivational force inherited from our past moral experience.The thinning of moral judgment makes possible moral strength, weakness, and apathy. In situations of moral struggle, a person making a level 2 judgment is not sufficiently motivated to act on it because the emotion that provides the motivational force is weak. ([Location 2213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2213))
- The morally strong person does not have sufficient motivation arising from the judgment itself to act on the judgment and must rely on additional sources of motivation that are also part of moral training. Training in what used to be called "will power" has that function. The morally weak person is in the same situation except that she lacks sufficient additional sources of motivation to act on the judgment. The weak motivational force of a level 2 moral judgment can sometimes be reduced to none at all, which is what happens in the morally apathetic person. The causes of apathy are typically other emotional or physical states, such as depression and weariness, that are strong enough to completely blot out the motivational force of some moral judgment. Since the apathetic person lacks all emotional connection to the judgment she makes, she even lacks the motive to call on the additional sources of motivation commonly used by the morally weak and strong.25 ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2223))
- Whereas Mill evaluates us on the basis of what we bring about by our acts and ignores our motives in doing so, Hume evaluates us on the basis of our motives and ignores what we do and bring about. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2269))
- Kant, by contrast, gives a central place to motive, but it is only the particular motive defining the Kantian good will - to do one'sduty out of a motive of duty - that gets the credit for underlying moral theory. Some writers on the moral significance of emotion have objected that such a motive is not an emotion and that Kant does not recognize the place of emotion in morality, but it does seem to me that he gives one emotion a central place: the respect for the rationality of persons. But other motives have no moral value in Kantian ethics except insofar as they are derived from the value of the motive of a good will.

- In the ordinary conduct of our lives, all of us care a great deal about the motives of others. One reason is that we think of motives as exemplifying the state of our relationship with them, and we care about our own motives for the same reason. In fact, motives are not merely symbolic; they are partially constitutive of the relationship between persons. This is most obvious in the case of personal and professional relationships, but it is not totally absent in our relationships with strangers and with a moral community. Modern ethical theory concentrates so much on producing a system of rules designed to avoid conflict and to handle conflict when it arises that the value of motive has almost disappeared from ethical debate. But even when the focus of the discussion is on the creation of a system of rules intended to govern the way all persons treat one another, it is likely that the value of the motive for behavior is bypassed only because the aim in the first instance is the minimal one of avoiding the worst cases of human disharmony. When I lived in Los Angeles, I was satisfied if I was not violently attacked on the streets, even if the motives of potential attackers for eschewing violence were not ones I would otherwise praise. But this is not to say that I do not care at all about the motivational states of strangers with regard to me, nor that… ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2276))
- I have proposed that emotions are primary in three senses:(1) They are genetically primary. They are the first step in the acquisition of moral concepts and beliefs, and they operate almost continuously throughout life in providing the primary motive to act on moral judgments. We learn emotions by imitating other persons. Emotions can be revised, and we need practical reason in order to determine the right way to act on them, but they occur prior to the operation of reason.(2) Emotions can serve as the primary concept in a comprehensive moral theory. I say "can" rather than "must" because I think the choice of theory is largely determined by the level of understanding that a theory provides. I am sure that there is more than one adequate moral theory, although good theories are usually good in different ways. In this part, I have set up the structure of a strong form of nonteleological virtue theory that is not based on eudaimonia or on what is good for human beings, nor on ends or outcomes of any kind, nor on acts or intentions to perform acts that follow principles of a certain kind. All moral properties of persons, acts, and the outcomes of acts are derived from good emotions. A good emotion is what paradigmatically good persons would have in the circumstances in question. I believe that this way of conceptualizing the relations among moral concepts gives us a better way of understanding those concepts than the standard ways, but I am not arguing for that in this book, except indirectly. My main purpose is to lay out the theory for the consideration of readers.(3) The value of emotion is metaphysically prior to the value of traits, acts… ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2288))
- Emotions can also give rise to a perception of obligation, a demand that certain acts are incompatible with the self. The good person is autonomous both because the source of moral properties is in part within the self, and because each person… ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2303))
- A contemporary friend of motives, Michael Slote (2001), faces this problem in his theory, since he defines the rightness of an act solely in terms of the agent's actual motives for the act.5 In motivation-based virtue theory, the rightness (permissibility) of an act is defined by what the virtuous person might do in relevantly similar circumstances, regardless of motive. This definition preserves the intuition that there is a sense of right that is unconcerned with the agent's actual motive. We do the right thing, in this sense, as long as our behavior meets certain external criteria. The way I put it is that the act has value indirectly from its relation to the acts of virtuous others. But we do care about the actual motive for an act, and the actual motive can make the act praiseworthy or blameworthy, virtuous or vicious. It can have value directly. This distinction is important whether the act… ([Location 2308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2308))
- I have argued that no particular bipolar response is the appropriate response to value, and that some values are too complex to be explained by the fact that some response is appropriate. The value properties that I believe are basic may call for particular responses, but they are nonetheless perceived through affective states that are not reducible to attraction/ repulsion, love/hate, and so on. These are the thick affective properties, and they are experienced in the state of emotion. If I am right that these properties are basic, that would explain the difficulty in reducing value to good/bad, right/wrong, or any other pair of value responses. ([Location 2352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2352))
- An ethic of imitation of the paradigmatic good person has another important advantage in that we do not need to decide in advance what range of behavior is morally important. The paradigmatically good person can show us not only which emotions are good ones, how we should perceive things, what we must and may do, and what outcomes are good to bring about, but also what we should care about. The paradigmatically good person can show us what wisdom is. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2361))
- According to what is usually called voluntarism, God created morality by an act of his free will and imposed it upon us. For us, morality is obedience to a divine sovereign; for God, morality does not clearly apply at all. According to intellectualism, there are eternal moral truths that God did not create and that are valid for God as well as for us. God commands us, but God's commandments come from his intellect's knowledge of these truths. In both approaches, morality is law. In Part II, I will propose a third alternative. God is essential to morality, not because it comes from either his intellect or his will, but because it comes from his motives. God's motive dispositions, like ours, are components of his virtues, and all moral value derives from God's motives. There… ([Location 2364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2364))
- To Plato, what is perfect of a kind is a nonpersonal Form, and the Forms are exemplars. But there are also numerous places in which he says that the highest human good is to be like God.6 In the Republic, we are told that to be virtuous is to be like God, who takes good care of those who are like him (Republic X, 613s-b), and in the Laws the Athenian claims that "the moderate man is God'sfriend, being like him" (Laws IV, 716b-d). The following passage from the Theaetetus is particularly telling:[I]t is not possible, Theodorus, that evil should be destroyed -for there must always be something opposed to the good; nor is it possible that it should have its seat in heaven. That is why a man should make all haste to escape from earth to heaven; and escape means becoming as like God as possible; and a man becomes like God when he becomes just and pure, with understanding.... In God there is no sort of wrong whatsoever; he is supremely just, and the thing most like him is the man who has become as just as it lies in human nature to be. (176a-b, c)The idea that our highest good is likeness to God also appears in the Phaedrus (246d, 248a, 249c), Timaeus (47c), Phaedo (78b-84b), and Philebus (28c-3oe). Perhaps Plato was aware… ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2383))

- The image of God in each individual human meant that each person was sacred and that offenses against a fellow human amounted to offenses against God himself - acts of blasphemy. Thus, murder was a sacrilege: "'Scripture instructs us that whatsoever sheds human blood is regarded as if he had diminished the divine image."'9 The negative moral doctrine of the Hebrew Bible is thus a warning to respect the image of God in others. The positive moral doctrine is the imitatio Dei, the atttempt to become as much like God as is humanly possible. "You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy" (Lev. 19:2). But in the Hebrew Scriptures, human beings become like God, not by imitation, but by following God's commandments. Hebrew morality is a… ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2404))
- In Plato and the Stoics, the respect in which likeness to God is our highest good is rationality or virtue. Those are the divine qualities whose imitation fulfills or perfects our nature. As I understand Christian theology, however, the fact that the Christian God is a person (persons) and not a set of qualities (rationality, goodness) is not incidental to the sense in which we ought to seek to be like God. The fact… ([Location 2412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2412))
- If God is not a person, imitation of God is quite a different matter than if God is a person(s). And if God is personal, there is still the issue of whether God's personhood is part of what should be imitated. If there is value in personhood, that affects both the way in which the virtues… ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2416))
- Like Boethius, Aquinas stresses that God is a substance, but he also indicates that "person" can convey "relation" as well as "substance" (art. 4). After Aquinas, some philosophers continued to use the Boethian definition, with its stress on substance, whereas others emphasized individuality or uniqueness as a distinguishing characteristic of persons.13 Clearly, there was some disagreement about the features that constitute personhood, but what I find particularly striking about the history of the use of "persona" from the early Christian period onward is that if the patristic scholars are right, we have inherited a concept of person that was shaped by the doctrine that there are three persons in one God and that Jesus Christ was one person with two natures. The question of whether God is a person (or persons) is therefore a peculiar one when set against this background. Of course, the concept of a person has… ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2422))

- The Unmoved Mover moves everything in the universe by attraction, like a giant metaphysical magnet. Aristotle says that it is living but that it has no relationships with anything outside of itself, nor is it even aware of anything outside of itself. It has no emotions, although we are told that it enjoys thinking on itself. It does not act to produce anything and has no intentional effects.14 Is… ([Location 2440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2440))
- Subjectivity has two aspects that may be logically distinct. A subjective being is self-conscious in the sense that it is conscious of being conscious. Second, subjectivity involves the experience of being a conscious self, thinking of oneself as " I." To think of onself as "I" is to be conscious of the difference between… ([Location 2447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2447))
- Divine freedom is problematic, since the modernidea of freedom differs significantly from the sense of freedom that Aquinas attributes to God. If freedom entails the ability to do otherwise in a morally significant sense, which allegedly entails the ability to do evil as well as good, it appears that God cannot be both free and essentially good. This issue involves a conflict… ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2459))
- Fifth, a person is incommunicable. This is the feature of personhood that I find most significant. The interpretation of incommunicability I am about to give is my own, and I do not claim that the church fathers had this in mind when they were developing the idea of the divine persons. My purpose is to interpret incommunicability in a way that ties it conceptually to the contrast between person and nature, the central distinction in the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation. According to the first doctrine, God is three persons but one individual divine nature. According to the second doctrine, Jesus Christ is one person with two natures. Both of these doctrines require a distinction between a person and an instance of a nature. What I mean by incommunicability is whatever it is about a… ([Location 2465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2465))
- I would not claim that Aquinas thought of incommunicability in the same way that I do, but in this passage he does attribute to human persons a value that is not simply the value of human nature. If the identity of a human person were exhausted by the set of properties she has qua instance of the natural-kind human being, plus accidental properties, it is hard to see why she would be governed for her own sake, since it is implausible that her accidental properties are such as to be… ([Location 2480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2480))
- I think that incommunicability is close to what some philosophers have had in mind when they have argued that if we love a person only as the instantiation of a set of qualities, we do not love the person. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2508))
- Aquinas has no hesitation in attributing to God most of the characteristics of personhood I have mentioned, albeit in an analogous sense, since in Aquinas's theory all properties that we attribute to God only apply analogously. The Thomistic God is obviously a rational being, is conscious of His selfhood, is free (in some sense), and has personal relationships both within the Trinity and with human persons, most especially through the Incarnation. It is doubtful whether he attributes to God incommunicability in my sense, since Aquinas maintains that God is identical with His nature (ST I, q. 3, a. 3).25 ([Location 2523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2523))
- A pure perfection is one that does not depend upon finitude or imperfection for its existence. A mixed perfection is a perfection that would not be needed at all by a perfect being, - for example, cunning. Crosby argues in his last chapter that personhood is a pure perfection. I will not examine Crosby's claim here, but it is illuminating to consider the consequences of his view. Not only does it mean that a perfect being must be a person, it also means that the personhood of humans is one of the ways - perhaps the most significant way - in which humans are like God. Rationality has traditionally been thought to be the mark of humankind that distinguishes us from other animals, and that view has continued up to the present. But even if that is the case, it does not follow that rationality is the highest or most characteristic mark of human persons. I believe that our personhood gets that distinction.Feuerbach and Nietzsche objected to the idea of thinking of human beings in relation to God on the grounds that this drains us of our dignity and strength, since when we transfer these qualities to God he is magnified at our expense. But what theonomy reveals is not that God is strong and we are weak, but that we are like God in our personhood. And if personhood essentially includes incommunicability, there is something about each person that is not shared by any other person, not even God. That forever changes how we look at ourselves. ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2555))
- Like all moral agents, God has motives, where motives function both as explanations of and justifications for an agent's acts. God does not have motive dispositions, if a disposition is a trait that is actualized only now and then; if God lacks potentiality, then God lacks dispositions. But even so, there are things that God would have done if the actual world had been different, and what God would have done is grounded in something analogous to what we call dispositions. We have no reason, so far, to deny that God has motives and virtues. Since God is the perfect agent, God's motives are the perfect motives. God's love is the perfect motive of love; God's compassion is the perfect motive of compassion; God's mercy is the perfect motive of mercy, and so on. ([Location 2571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2571))
- Emotions were traditionally called passions because they were understood as ways of being acted upon rather than as ways of acting. But in the theory of emotion sketched in Chapter 2, emotion is passive only in the sense in which belief or knowledge is passive. It is a way of construing something outside of the agent. Even the high metaphysical view of God's nature is thought to be compatible with the idea that God has beliefs.

- In response to this objection, it should be noted that while Aquinas says that virtue is a habit, "habitus" to Aquinas means fundamentally the same thing as "having." The dispositional aspect of a habitus is important in his account of human virtues and vices because of our temporality and imperfection, but the ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2664))
- In Divine Motivation theory, God is the paradigmatically good person of motivation-based virtue theory. Human motives are good insofar as they imitate the motives of God as those motives would be expressed in finite and embodied human persons.

- The love of God in its highest form is not to have love "for" God, the All-merciful - for a mere concept, in effect; it is to participate in His love for the world (amare mundum in Deo) and for Himself (amare Deum in Deo); in other words, it is what the scholastics, the mystics and Saint Augustine before them, called "amare in Deo."

- Hence there is but one basic moral relationship between men of good-will: as fellow-servants, partisans of a common Ideal and co-partners in a common Love. (p. ([Location 2783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2783))
- In imitation of God, we try to love as he loves, not for the sake of something else, not even for the sake of the love itself, but just because the love of God has the power to attract us, to make us want to imitate God. To learn to love like God is to learn to love just because we want to, and that means learning to become the kind of persons who love just because they want to. ([Location 2785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2785))
- In the case of God's love for His creatures, His love not only does not consist in desires for those creatures, but the desires to which his love leads are not desires for their welfare as such. God does not aim at whatever is good for us qua good for us. Rather, God has particular aims for us - that we have certain beliefs (true ones), that we have certain emotions (ones like his), that we use our practical reasoning in putting our motives into action, and so on. He also wants us to be healthy, to have friendships with other creatures and with himself. All of these things are good, but there is no need to say that God desires them because they are good or because they are good for us. He desires these things because that is what loving beings desire for those they love. What is goodfor us is just what God desires for us. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2810))
- Let us look a bit more closely at God's emotions. The thick properties that the world has are those perceived by God. Their existence depends upon God's affective perception. The lovability of the world comes into existence with God's loving it; the despicability of certain features of the world comes into existence with God's hating those features, and so on. Love has the distinction of being a central motive of God, and so lovability is a central thick property of creatures. My position is close to a well-known view of agape defended by Anders Nygren. Nygren (1953) writes:Agape is creative love. God does not love that which is already in itself worthy of love, but on the contrary, that which in itself has no worth acquires worth just by becoming the object of God's love. Agape has nothing to do with the kind of love that depends on the recognition of a valuable quality in an object; agape does not recognize value; but creates it. Agape loves, and imparts value by loving. The man who is loved by God has no value in himself; what gives him value is precisely the fact that God loves him.

- Now consider color properties such as red. Does God perceive red things as red? Does God perceive smooth things as smooth, salty things as salty, musky things as musky, and melodious sounds as melodious? These properties seem to depend not only upon the observer's having sensory faculties, but also on the particular sensory faculties that humans have. Note that the question I am asking is not whether God can know that red things are red or that salty food tastes salty. I assume that that question can be answered in the affirmative. What I am asking is whether God perceives red things as red, where I have been using the expression "as red" only for cases in which the perceiver has a sensation of red. If God does not have sensations but does have certain emotions, such as love, and if the way God perceives… ([Location 2847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2847))
- With God as the ultimate exemplar, we can give a more complete answer to the question of what makes the paradigmatically good person's emotions good ones. The answer given in motivation-based virtue theory is that those emotions fit their intentional objects. The more complete answer is that those emotions imitate the emotions that God has toward those objects. All moral properties are ultimately grounded in the emotional experience of God. The value of a human emotion in a given situation is limited by the emotions that God would have if He were in that situation. The anchoring of good emotion in the emotions of God makes Divine Motivation theory more clearly realist than motivation-based virtue theory would be without a supreme exemplar.In Divine Motivation theory,… ([Location 2856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2856))

- I MUST CHRISTIANITY BE AN ETHIC OF LAW?Christian theological ethics has usually been an ethic of law. It is worth considering why this is so. Is there something about Christian doctrine that requires it? Elizabeth Anscombe (1958) implies an affirmative answer in her classic paper, "Modern Moral Philosophy" (p. 30). There Anscombe argues not only that Christianity has a law ethic, but also that the favorite concept of modern British moral philosophers - obligation - makes no sense except within a law system of ethics.' She goes on to argue that an ethics of law makes no sense without a divine lawgiver, so her conclusion is not only that Christian ethics is an ethics of law, but also that any philosopher who wants to retain the concept of obligation as developed… ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2879))

- It seems to me, however, that morality as law cannot be seen merely as the result of the Fall, since in the story of Adam and Eve God gave them a command in advance of their lapse. It was, in fact, their disobedience to a divine command that constituted the Fall. So the Hebrews must have understood morality as intrinsically lawful. And the Greeks did not. More significantly, the Greek identification of reality and the good was not given up in subsequent Christian philosophy. Augustine and Boethius and Aquinas did not give it up - and they knew about the Fall. ([Location 2898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2898))
- Christ is not just the instantiation of a set of virtues, and his life is not just an illustration of a set of general principles. If that were the case, someone else could have filled the role instead.9 This raises an interesting theological question: Should Christians think of the Incarnation as a central event in human moral awakening, or was its purpose limited to atonement for sin? ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2915))
- For Anselm, the Incarnation was a drastic move in response to sin. It was not part of the original divine plan, and its primary purpose was the atonement. In the thirteenth century, Robert Grosseteste rejected Anselm's view, contending that God would have become incarnate even if the human race had not fallen.The Incarnation would have perfected the human race and all of creation because it would have been a manifestation of divine goodness, wisdom, and power.10 Notice that the aims that Grosseteste identifies are not distinctively moral ones. God would have become incarnate for the sake of the order and excellence of the universe, a purpose that sounds more aesthetic than moral. Bonaventure was sympathetic with the positions of both Anselm and Grosseteste and declared both to be defensible, but he decided it was more consonant with piety to regard the Incarnation mainly as a remedy for sin." Aquinas concurred.12 However, Scotus enthusiastically adopted the view that God would have become incarnate even if Adam had not sinned. The hypostatic union is a proximate means of enlarging the Trinitarian community of co-lovers, and this was settled by God prior (in the explanatory order) to the Fall and God's foreknowledge of the Fall. Scotus's reason for rejecting the Anselmian/Thomistic position is particularly interesting: If the Incarnation were motivated only by the sin of Adam, then the best thing God does in Creation would be motivated by the worst thing creatures do, and that would… ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2917))

- The imitatio Christi has advantages over the imitatio Dei, particularly if we adopt the lofty metaphysical view of God inherited from the Greeks that I endorsed in Chapter 5.

- My objective is to show how the traditional doctrine of the Incarnation can be integrated into Divine Motivation theory. That can be done in a number of different ways, and as I go along I will refer to the work of theologians whose work I find particularly relevant to the purpose. Irenaeus and Bonhoeffer are separated by eighteen centuries, but I findboth of them helpful for their interpretations of the significance of the Incarnation for virtue ethics. The work of moral theologians in narrative ethics is also… ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2940))
- Even fictional persons can act as exemplars, but the traditional doctrine that the Christ of subsequent theology was a real historical person identical to Jesus of Nazareth is important for the ethical theory of this book for many reasons, among which is the fact that the value of the incommunicability of persons is difficult to see and to defend if the exemplar is not also an incommunicable person. So while it is not essential that the theory use the high Christology I am adopting, it is important both that there be an historical exemplar about whom we have vivid descriptions, and that… ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2947))

- A harder problem arises from another of Murdoch's comments in the same paper. She remarks on how riveting Kant is when he says that even when confronted with Christ, a man still consults his own reason:How recognizable, how familiar to us, is the man so beautifully portrayed in the Grundlegung, who confronted even with Christ turns away to consider the judgement of his own conscience and to hear the voice of his own reason. Stripped of the exiguous metaphysical background which Kant was prepared to allow him, this man is with us still, free, independent, lonely, powerful, rational, responsible, brave, the hero of so many novels and books of moral philosophy. (p. ioi)And, I would add, he is clearly recognizable as an American folk hero. But rather than delving into the ethical intricacies of American mythology, let us look at the rest of Murdoch's paragraph, which is revealing:The raison d'etre of this attractive but misleading creature is not far to seek. He is the offspring of the age of science, confidently rational and yet increasingly aware of his alienation from the material universe which his discoveries reveal; and since he is not a Hegelian (Kant, not Hegel, has provided Western ethics with its dominating image), his alienation is without cure. He is the ideal citizen of the liberal state, a warning held up to tyrants. He has the virtue which the age requires and admires, courage. It is not such a very long step from Kant to Nietzsche, and… ([Location 2969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2969))
- The Incarnation shifts the ethical direction. Christ is the Word made flesh, the perfect revelation of the Father, which means that to the Christian, God is most perfectly revealed, not in a set of commandments or in any written or spoken words, but in a person. Jesus says he comes to fulfill the law, not to destroy it (Matt. 5:17). Through him, we have access to the Father and come to share in the divine nature. (See Eph. 1:9.) We do that by imitation. "In a word, as God's dear children, try to be like him, and live in love as Christ loved you" (Eph. 5:1). The whole law is summed up in love (… ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=2981))

- Given the hold that Divine Command theory has had on a good portion of Christian ethics, I find it illuminating to note how little there is of commandment and law in the New Testament, and how much there is of the imitation of the virtues of Christ. The New Testament does not rescind the Ten Commandments, which give the content of morality, but the issue is whether we are to think of the commandments as constitutive of morality. Even when Christ gives commands, his injunctions generally call us to have motivations, the basic components of virtues, as in the Beatitudes and the two great commandments… ([Location 3003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=3003))
- Jesus, "the man of sorrows," clearly has emotions, and not all of them are positive. We are called to imitate his emotions and their expression in action, and this appears in the liturgy. When Christ washes his disciples' feet, he says, "You should wash one another's feet" (John 13:13- 14); and the celebrant of the Easter Vigil service, whether Pope or humble parish priest, does that every year. The New Testamentfocuses primarily on emotions as motives that give us both an impetus to act in characteristic ways and a new… ([Location 3011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L5U274&location=3011))
- The motive for imitation is that what we are imitating is love we have already received. Love is naturally imitative. "We love because He first loved us" (I John 4:18). "God is love" (I John 4:16). We forgive because we have been forgiven, and we love because we are loved.The ethics that we learn from the New Testament can be systematized into a deontological theory only with great difficulty. It seems to me that the message is primarily one of transforming our vision of ourselves, the world, and our relation to God. In seeing things differently, we become differently motivated, and in being differently motivated, we act differently. Action is the fruit of a deeper way in which the person is transformed.
