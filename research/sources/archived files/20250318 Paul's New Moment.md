### Highlights

- But for the purposes of our thesis, we need only agree that theology (and the Christian tradition) serves as a wellspring capable of funding a materialist politics of subjective truth. Unlike liberalism, theology has a positive truth-claim, namely, that God's disclosure happens most fully in the Event of Christ's death on the cross. ([Location 28](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=28))
- this Event forever shatters a world defined by passive indifference, diluting "truth" to the common denominator, and clarifies the stakes of a materialist life. Consequently this positive stance is not founded on an eternal, unchanging idea but in a fragile, contingent Event in time and space. ([Location 30](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=30))
- Further, this Event gives the ontologicalcoordinates of a stance for something and not simply a stance that is picked out of the choices already determined ahead of time. So in the end, this positive theological stance radically shatters the liberal view of freedom as highlighted by Lenin. ([Location 31](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=31))
- Lenin, as Zizek has shown, cuts through the clutter when he posits a decisive distinction between actual and formal freedom, which helps to clarify how sharp Christianity's stance is compared to that of liberalism. ([Location 33](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=33))
- Liberalism can only ever provide formal freedom, which is freedom to choose between options-except that these "options" are themselves never chosen by a subject but are already predetermined. Thus in formal freedom one has a choice to live one's life within predetermined coordinates (that is, you can buy this deodorant and not that one, and so forth). ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=34))
- But Lenin is clear about the fact that this type of freedom amounts to nothing but a trick-or, in Marxist terms, ideology. It is ideological because we think we are free, but in reality we function more like robots in a demonic laboratory. ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=36))
- By contrast, actual freedom is the freedom to choose an entirely new set of coordinates. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=37))
- This matches well with Christianity's claim to the Incarnational Event, inasmuch as its truth-claim is not determined by a set of predetermined a priori coordinates but is an unabashedly positive event not capable of being absorbed into the domesticated ideological fabric of our world. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=38))
- In short, and siding with Paul, we propose that Christian theology contains within it an irreducible revolutionary possibility that ruptures with the predetermined coordinates of the world and offers an entirely new kind of political subject altogether. In this way, too, the positive side of this thesis is that theology provides a critical stance against the basic assumptions and ruling ideologies of this world. ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=39))
- how do we follow the biblical injunction to live in the world, but not of the world (see, for example, John 17) ? The standard interpretation of this injunction today takes the form of two different views. The first, fundamentalist view is simply to detach the material world from one's eternal "soul." Thus the tension is neutralized. The world will finally vanish and does not ultimately matter. In that sense the world really does not exist after all but is more like a passing illusion. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=63))
- The other and opposite interpretation comes from the liberal camp, which proposes that there is no real difference between the world and the Christian community of resistance. The problem with the liberal understanding is that the tension between being "in" the world and not being "of" the world is neutralized precisely by valorizing the world as if it is all there ever is and ever will be. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=65))
- notice that these two apparently different interpretative horizons (fundamentalist and liberal) are united at a deeper, more secret level, for they each extract the struggle of Christian resistance either by giving up the world (fundamentalist) or by giving over the world (liberalism) to the powers. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=68))
- In contrast to this dualism, which in reality hides a secret monism, this book's main imperative is to challenge the American bourgeois interpretation of Christian faith that simply hands over the world to the corporation without a fight. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=69))
- We want to locate and characterize the point of tension established between the prepositions "in" (the world) and "of" (the world). Our thesis begins by examining the basic contours of contemporary philosophy to see if there are resources for the struggle we are announcing. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=70))
- our thesis states that Christian theology possesses the requisite ontological resources that deliver a revolutionary politics grounded in the Incarnational Event of God becoming human. Indeed this Event of God becoming human is so earth-shattering that it enacts something akin to the psychoanalytic concept of trauma, in that the very means by which an event is birthed forever throws everything so far off balance that even our very conception of this Event is rendered forever irreparable.9 ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=104))
- twentieth-century forms of theology havebeen just as guilty of falling prey to the false split or dualism between the secular (immanent reason) and the religious (pure dematerialized transcendence). ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=110))

- in the early twenty-first century, capitalism appears to need to buttress itself with the approval and connivance of actual religion. Fundamentalist and evangelical Protestantism of certain stripes plays this role, and increasingly a segment of the Catholic Church also-so-called Whig Thomists, most notably in the United States and in Italy.2 ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=246))
- liberalism concerns the biopolitical,3 for liberalism promotes an imagined self-governing of life through a certain capture and disciplining of natural forces of aggression and desire within the framework of a cultural game, governed by civil conventions and instituted laws. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=250))
- Both in politics proper and in economics, liberalism rejoices in an order that is supposed to emerge naturally from the clash of passions themselves. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=253))
- This may, as in contract theory, imply a point of rupture in which the clash is diverted from anarchic war to a regulated agonistic game, or else, as in the more sophisticated perspectives deriving from the Scottish enlightenment, it may imply a precontractual tendency of passion to balance passion, resulting in an unplanned and regulated order, political as well as political-economic. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=254))
- In either case it is deemed that, by nature, a simultaneously competing and cooperating (through natural mutual sympathy) human multitude erects an artificial framework that will channel this spontaneity for further mutual benefit. Life itself is seen as generating contract and law. Contract and law are seen as disciplining life, but only in order to further it.

- In practice, however, there is nothing stable about this paradox. To the contrary, the regulative framework for economic competition periodically proves irksome to certain of the competitors.

- because the formal framework of law is absolute and is taken to proceed from universal consent, an absolutely sovereign power must be erected in order to enforce this law. But then one can ask, does sovereignty really proceed from a "prior" instance of instituting multitudinous life, or rather from the "post" instance of artificial control of human life that stops it from running… ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=281))
- Since unlimited power has been granted to the sovereign center in order to preserve a formal order of regulated self-interest, a pure logic of power for its own sake is bound to take over. The supposed representative guardian of sovereign authority will excessively pursue the interests of its own exercise for its own sake. Division of powers installed at the center in order to mitigate this tendency can do so only to a certain degree, and ultimately, since the balancing occurs precisely at the center,… ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=289))

- since, in a democracy, the policing power will covertly lay claim as a citizen-defending body to an unrestricted right to do whatever is necessary in the name of such defense and will tend to enjoy absolutely unrestricted access to all information (unrestricted by local or aristocratic privilege), democratic policing, as Walter Benjamin argues in his "Critique of Violence," tends more to the totalitarian than did the policing of absolute monarchies (which remained… ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=304))

- Where legal authority once more assumes a manifestly armed guise, the danger that this guise will give it an anarchic appearance may render it necessary to look for legitimation in terms of an absolute transcendent personal authority.

- For conservative evangelical Christianity in our day, it is consequently supposed that there would be anarchy without a constant police war on human sin waged by a sovereign power. The apparent anarchy of the policing power as such can be overlooked, because what, in humanterms, might appear to be "just one more power" (Augustine's unjust political authority as a "robber band") has in fact been… ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004E10H5O&location=337))
