# Theological Mutation 1: Primitive Biblicism

## Diagnostic Analysis

### Definition
Primitive Biblicism claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning while bypassing interpretive traditions, scholarly context, and ecclesial discernment. It presents itself as "just reading what the Bible says" while concealing its own interpretive frameworks.

### Key Characteristics
- **Claims of Direct Access**: Asserts unmediated access to "plain meaning" of scripture
- **Hermeneutical Naivety**: Denies the role of interpretive frameworks while employing them unconsciously
- **Decontextualization**: Removes biblical texts from their historical and literary contexts
- **Binary Reductionism**: Reduces complex scriptural narratives to simple binary distinctions
- **Selective Reading**: Cherry-picks texts that support predetermined conclusions while ignoring contradictory passages
- **Historical Discontinuity**: Ignores the history of interpretation and development of doctrine
- **Individualism**: Privileges individual interpretation over ecclesial discernment

### Manifestations in MAGA Christianism
- Proof-texting to justify nationalist policies without regard for narrative context
- Binary moral frameworks presented as "biblical" despite selective application
- Claims of returning to "biblical values" without historical awareness
- Appeals to isolated verses to justify political positions while ignoring broader biblical themes of justice, mercy, and love
- Rejection of scholarly consensus as "liberal" or "compromised" when it challenges preferred readings
- Presenting partisan political interpretations as direct biblical mandates

### Theological and Social Consequences
- Creates spiritual foundation for authoritarianism by claiming divine authority for human interpretations
- Undermines genuine theological dialogue by dismissing alternative readings
- Enables moral inconsistency by allowing selective application of biblical principles
- Facilitates us/them divisions by identifying preferred interpretation with God's own voice
- Prevents critical self-reflection by conflating human interpretation with divine revelation
- Provides divine justification for maintaining existing power structures

## Relational Freedom Theology Response

### Christocentric Hermeneutic
- Center biblical interpretation on the person and work of Christ
- Interpret all scripture through the lens of Christ's revelation of God's character
- Recognize Jesus' own interpretive method that prioritized love of God and neighbor
- Allow Christ's life and teaching to critique our reading of other biblical texts

### Interpretive Humility
- Acknowledge the gap between divine revelation and human understanding
- Recognize all interpretation as contextual and perspectival
- Approach scripture with awareness of our own biases and limitations
- Practice epistemic humility regarding the certainty of our interpretations

### Communal Discernment
- Engage scripture within communities of interpretation rather than in isolation
- Value the church's historical traditions of interpretation
- Embrace diverse perspectives as enriching rather than threatening
- Practice the discipline of listening to marginalized voices as crucial for fuller understanding

### Narrative Approach
- Read scripture as a complex, multi-voiced narrative rather than a collection of proof texts
- Understand biblical texts within their historical, cultural, and literary contexts
- Attend to the overarching narrative of God's redemptive work
- Resist reducing scripture to abstract principles divorced from narrative context

### Transformative Intent
- Approach scripture as formative rather than merely informative
- Allow scripture to question our assumptions rather than merely confirm them
- Embrace scripture's call to conversion of life rather than justification of existing positions
- Read scripture as invitation to participation in God's work rather than merely intellectual assent
