# Interindependence: Practicing Freedom Beyond MAGA Christianism's Mutations

## Prologue: Beyond Domination and Isolation

When Jesus spoke of abundant life, he wasn't describing a fortress of individual righteousness or a battlefield of cultural conquest. He was inviting us into a way of being that defies the binary mutations of MAGA Christianism—a life of genuine interindependence where freedom emerges not from power over others, but from power with others.

This is freedom as God dreams it: a dynamic, breathing ecosystem of mutual recognition where each person's flourishing becomes possible through, not in spite of, our deep interconnection.

## Metaphor One: The Musical Ensemble - Harmony Through Distinctive Voices

Imagine a jazz ensemble—not as a collection of solo performers competing for attention, but as a living organism of collaborative creativity. Each musician brings a distinctive instrument, a unique timbre, a personal history. The trumpet doesn't seek to silence the bass; the drums don't demand the saxophone conform to a single rhythm. Instead, they listen. They respond. They create something transcendent that no individual could produce alone.

### The Theological Resonance

In this ensemble, individual excellence emerges through attentive relationship. The trumpet's brilliance is revealed not by overpowering other instruments, but by creating space, by listening, by allowing the bass's deep pulse to provide foundational momentum. This is participatory freedom—where my most authentic self emerges not through isolation or domination, but through responsive listening and creative dialogue.

MAGA Christianism presents a different musical metaphor—a rigid marching band where conformity is mistaken for harmony, where individual instruments are forced into a single, militaristic beat. But the gospel ensemble invites a more complex musicality: a harmony that celebrates difference, that transforms individual voices into a living conversation.

## Metaphor Two: The Ecological System - Resilience Through Interdependence

Consider an old-growth forest—not as a collection of separate trees, but as a complex network of mutual sustenance. Beneath the visible canopy, mycelial networks connect root systems, allowing trees to share nutrients, to warn each other of threats, to support even wounded or struggling members.

A Douglas fir doesn't compete with a cedar; it participates in a larger systems of mutual survival. When one tree experiences drought or disease, surrounding trees can redirect water and nutrients through underground networks. Diversity isn't just tolerated—it's the very mechanism of collective resilience.

### The Theological Interpretation

This is freedom as ecological grace—a way of being where my flourishing is intimately tied to the flourishing of those around me. MAGA Christianism imagines community as a monoculture, a single species plantation designed for maximum extraction. But God's dream is a complex ecosystem where difference creates strength, where vulnerability is a conduit of collective healing.

My freedom is not about standing alone, immune to surrounding conditions. It's about developing the sensitivity to recognize how deeply my life is braided with others—human and more-than-human. True freedom becomes the capacity to participate in these intricate networks of mutual care.

## Metaphor Three: The Dance - Improvisation as Spiritual Practice

Watch master dancers—not as individual performers executing predetermined steps, but as a dynamic conversation of bodies in motion. Each movement emerges through listening, through split-second negotiations of weight, balance, and intention. A lift is not a unilateral action, but a collaborative moment of trust and mutual transformation.

The dance is neither completely scripted nor entirely spontaneous. It requires deep practice, muscle memory, technical skill—and simultaneously, an openness to the unexpected, a willingness to be surprised by one's partner's creativity.

### The Theological Choreography

Here, freedom is improvisational—a spiritual practice of continuously negotiated relationship. MAGA Christianism offers a rigid choreography of predetermined roles, where movement is about maintaining hierarchical position. But the gospel dance invites us into a more radical vulnerability: a way of being where leadership and support are constantly shifting, where strength is revealed through responsiveness rather than rigidity.

## The Convergence: Participatory Freedom as Divine Imagination

These metaphors—the musical ensemble, the ecological system, the dance—converge on a single theological insight: Freedom is not a private possession, but a collaborative art. It's not achieved through individual effort, but cultivated through practices of attentive love.

This is freedom as God dreams it—a way of being where:
- Distinctive voices create surprising harmonies
- Vulnerability becomes a conduit of collective resilience
- Improvisation reveals deeper patterns of grace

Against MAGA Christianism's seven mutations, we offer not merely a critique, but an invitation. An invitation to practice a freedom that is always relational, always becoming, always surprising.

A freedom where justice, love, beauty, and divine power don't compete, but dance.
