### Highlights

- Derrida (explained most lucidly by B. Johnson 1980 [1978]; see further in ch. 1). He is suggesting here that the way we frame the object of our investigation inevitably controls what we see, but the biases and interpretative acts involved with this framing tend to be hidden unless we name them explicitly. They often hide in Pauline investigation, as elsewhere, under the ostensibly neutral notion of “context.” But every constitution of a historical context is itself an interpretative act — an act of framing. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=282))
- Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, wrote 1 Thessalonians from Athens at some point after these founding visits (1 Thess 1:1; 3:1),3 hence from the neighboring region of Achaia. ([Location 4753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=4753))
- the events seem to belong to the same broad missionary trajectory, because the missionaries are the same — most notably, including Silvanus only here within Paul’s broader activities. But we do not know exactly how long this missionary group operated together or what other regions it may have visited. If it was effective and harmonious, it presumably could have worked and traveled together for years. ([Location 4762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=4762))
- had duly visited and returned — a journey from Athens to Thessalonica taking between four days and a fortnight depending on mode,9 and a return journey roughly the same. ([Location 4782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=4782))

- The Thessalonians were suffering, and he was worried that this had weakened their resolve and their loyalty. Moreover, in the point crucial for any sequencing judgments, it seems that this suffering was closely connected to the suffering that they had all experienced during the original founding of the community. If the same basic period of suffering was in view, then it follows that 1 Thessalonians was composed not long after the community’s establishment and largely contiguous to it, and almost certainly prior to the Corinthian mission as well.

- here he writes that a key cause of the missionaries’ concern was the possibility that the Thessalonians had been unsettled by their suffering, and specifically by “these sufferings” ([Location 4807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=4807))

- And it simply makes the most sense if the sufferings spoken of all refer to the same basic period of struggle that began when the community was founded. One continuous period of struggle is in view that was inaugurated when the missionaries came to Thessalonica and founded the community and has continued during their recent absence.

- the substantive claim in both texts is the same as well — that the Thessalonian suffering was an imitation of Christ, of the missionaries, and, in due course, of the early church in Judea, in that it was inflicted by fellow countrypeople.

- In sum, the relevant data combine to suggest that the sequence of events detailed in the letter is reasonably immediate: suffering took place at Thessalonica as some Thessalonians converted to Christ and a loyal community was constituted; the missionaries left, ending up at Athens; they badly wanted to return, given the pressure that the Thessalonians were under, but were constrained; fearing damage to the community, they sent Timothy, who was apparently not so constrained; and upon Timothy’s return and report of his visit, they wrote a joyful and grateful letter seeking to affirm the Thessalonians’ resolve and loyalty, as well as to correct some of the community’s problematic developments and to respond to some of its concerns.

- The founding visit to Corinth took place sometime after the founding visit to Athens. If the missionary party retained copies of its letters, then it arrived in Corinth with a copy of 1 Thessalonians, and it is likely that the Corinthians were interested in this letter and heard it. (As a result, the Corinthians’ first apostolic letter from Paul was actually 1 Thess.) And they probably went on to produce their own copies of it, if Paul and his circle did not simply supply those. So when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians later, coauthoring this time with Sosthenes, it seems quite plausible that he would evoke an earlier piece of correspondence that the Corinthians knew well, in effect building on its structure and cadences.

- They are clearly occasional documents. But apparently, they spoke into their particular occasions with deeply considered authority that was expected to be attended to carefully and applied. They were pedagogical templates, analogous to philosophical letters, elicited by circumstance but dispatched to be learned and internalized.

- He argues that “the image [of the end in 1 Thessalonians] is at odds with the view set forth by the author of 2 Thessalonians.” The author of the former (which is also representative of Paul’s other authentic letters on the basis of Rom 13:12 and Phil 4:5) expects that “the end is to come suddenly and expectedly, ‘like a thief in the night’ ” (5:2). The author of the latter thinks that, conversely, “there will in fact be plenty of warning, a whole sequence of events that must transpire.” ([Location 5051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5051))

- the Thessalonians have been unsettled by the suggestion “that the day of the Lord has come” or “. . . is imminent” ([Location 5217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5217))

- The fidelity of the Thessalonians has been shaken. Like nervous troops in combat under heavy fire, they are wavering and possibly about to break and flee. But a second situation is also apparent in the letter. Some of the Thessalonians are acting lazily, refusing to work and consequently to contribute to what seems to be a common pot in the community, although they are still eating from it (3:10-13).53 Paul seems to be concerned about this laziness and its consequences as well.

- If the Thessalonians had become concerned that the parousia of Jesus had taken place, then they had grounds for considerable anxiety. Putting things at their simplest, they would now have to ask whether they had been left behind. If Jesus had returned and gone again, then their endurance through frightful pressure had been in vain. They were deceived, pathetic, and ridiculous, as well as — worse still — not saved at all. Few suggestions could presumably have unsettled them more than this one. ([Location 5251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5251))

- It had been suggested to the Thessalonians in some convincing way, perhaps with fake apostolic authority, that the parousia of the Lord Jesus had already taken place. And this had all come to Paul’s attention through some unnamed oral report. ([Location 5257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5257))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- The timetable revolves around the revelation of a “Man of Lawlessness” (ὁ ἄνθρωπος τῆς ἀνομίας, ὁ υἱὸς τῆς ἀπωλείας — although he is not glossed with lawlessness so much as associated with it). This figure will enthrone himself in God’s temple blasphemously in a false parousia accompanied by all kinds of ostensible wonders. Many will be deceived by this, thereby generating a widespread apostasy (2:3, 10-12), and they will receive harsh punishment — this group clearly including those currently troubling the Thessalonians (1:6, 8-10). The judgment will take place when the Lord Jesus overthrows the Man of Lawlessness and his minions during his own glorious and vastly more powerful parousia. The Lord Jesus will strike then with a breath (2:8), a tongue of fire, and a multitude of angels (1:7-9). In short, Paul suggests in 2 Thessalonians that the real parousia cannot come until the false parousia of the Man of Lawlessness has taken place, an event that should be utterly unmistakable, although it is for now hidden and restrained (2:6-7). So the Thessalonians can rest assured that the Lord Jesus’ parousia has not yet taken place. ([Location 5261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5261))

- Nevertheless, encouraged and strengthened by this proof that the Lord Jesus is yet to return, deployed partly by way of reminder in the letter, the Thessalonians can now respond to their election by standing firm in word and deed, loving God and persevering as Christ did, with a firmness that should extend to an ongoing commitment to the teachings and traditions transmitted by their founding missionaries. And with this whole issue settled, Paul turns in the letter to the secondary but still significant matter of laziness on the part of some within the community.

- The underlying episode is, as Hugo Grotius (1679 [1640]; 1829 [1641]) suggested some time ago, “the Gaian crisis,” meaning specifically the plan of Gaius to erect a statue of himself as Jupiter in the temple at Jerusalem, along with the plan’s consequences.

- The progress of this plan can be dated reasonably precisely, largely because its accomplishment rested on the governor of Syria, Publius Petronius, appointed to achieve it. (He replaced Lucius Vitellius, who was involved with the broader events that led to Paul’s dramatic escape from Damascus late in 36 ce.) ([Location 5304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5304))

- This placed Petronius on the coast not far away from the northern Jewish territories, especially Galilee. And he consequently encountered on his arrival what was in effect a massive campaign of passive resistance by regional Jews, one so extensive that the autumnal harvest was jeopardized (and this confirms the earlier seasonal sequence).61 Petronius responded to this campaign rather remarkably, undertaking to petition Gaius to ameliorate the plan, doubtless thereby risking his office and also possibly his life. So the plan was delayed over the winter ([Location 5310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5310))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- This interference stalled the plan through the winter, and Philo even suggests that the goal of making a statue publicly in Sidon was abandoned, being replaced by a scheme to make one secretly in Rome (42.337; 43.338). This was to be installed personally in the course of a coastal voyage by the emperor to Alexandria. But Gaius was assassinated in January of the following year — in time for this news to overtake his instructions to Petronius to commit suicide for his disobedience. He was killed on January 24, 41 ce, and the vagaries of winter travel in relation to the contrasting instructions to Petronius further confirm this account. So a firm date can be derived for the events of the preceding year, that is, 40 ce. ([Location 5315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5315))

- Jewish tradition was familiar with the threatened desecration of the Jerusalem temple with a pagan cult by an evil foreign ruler because of the Maccabean crisis in the second century bce, a narrative imprinted especially on the book of Daniel. This bequeathed a discourse of eschatological temple violation to both Jews and Christians, one that involved the blasphemous ascription of deity to pagan kings.

- But 1 Maccabees understands it more plausibly to be an altar dedicated to Zeus that was placed on top of the original altar of burnt offerings, thereby polluting the Jewish altar underneath with sacrifices of unclean food, most notably of pork (see 1:54, 59). That the lifeblood of unclean animals ran down regularly over the site at which daily libation was undertaken with holy lifeblood from clean animals was a terrible desecration for Jews, eliciting strong language. And this arrangement accords with typical pagan temple practice. The cult statue would normally have been placed inside the building, which housed what was effectively the god in suitable comfort and splendor. Sacrifices took place outside, in front of this structure. So “the abomination that desolates” in Daniel seems to have been the desecrating altar to Zeus, erected outside the holy of holies, on top of the altar of burnt offering.

- This placement of an enthroned figure at the center of the cult and the consequent emphasis on the worshipful confession of his divinity were distinctive to Hellenistic and, later, to Roman imperial worship, although the Roman variation had no extensive sacrificial practices. However, it was certainly sufficient to offend aniconic transcendental Jewish monotheists deeply, and just the same outrage is apparent in the text of 2 Thessalonians.

- These emphases are new. But of course they are readily explained by Gaius’s plan to install a bust establishing his own divinity in the precise form of Jupiter in the Jerusalem temple, a plan inaugurated, at the latest, during the winter of 39-40 ce. Moreover, only at this time in the Common Era was the Jerusalem temple specifically threatened with the installation of a cult statue celebrating a mortal man’s divinity and, in effect, only with this — that is, not also with the destruction of the city or the desecration of the altar. Pompey simply entered the holy of holies; and during the first revolt, the city and the temple were destroyed.

- Hence, the instance in 2 Thessalonians is indubitably to seating, which in this cultic context denotes enthronement. It is precisely this act that “demonstrates that he is ‘God,’ ” namely, the figure’s blasphemous enthronement as king in the temple of the true divine King who cannot be imaged, and his acclamation as such by foolish and deceived pagans and apostates. ([Location 5369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5369))

- However, the sources note that Gaius’s divine identifications were especially profligate and bold. He linked himself to many gods, and portrayed himself not infrequently as Jupiter, the king of the gods. Hence, it was apparently his intention to install a statue celebrating his divinity as Jupiter in the Jerusalem temple. Cassius Dio notes, moreover, that this magnificent statue was to be modeled on the famous chryselephantine image of Zeus crafted by Phidias at Olympia — one of the seven wonders of the world (59.28.3).64 Suetonius indirectly confirms this when he records that Gaius tried to remove the original statue from Olympia to Rome, intending to replace its head with his own image (Gaius 2.2). And this statue, unusually, was enthroned and seated. (The anomaly was entirely deliberate; this feature, combined with the cramped temple design at Olympia, created an atmosphere of overwhelming power.

- And it follows, if this association holds good, that the eschatological scenario presupposed by 2 Thessalonians had to be constructed sometime after late 39 ce, with the founding visit to Thessalonica necessarily taking place after this temporal marker as well, since the letter is reminding the Thessalonians of a specific timetable and scenario that they were taught personally by Paul during the community’s establishment (2:5).

- they questioned Paul about the timing of the Lord Jesus’ parousia (or something similar). They became unsettled by the notion that this parousia had already taken place, but were recalled by Paul to the parallel suggestion that the parousia of the Man of Lawlessness was still outstanding. The suitability of these questions to the immediate aftermath of the Gaian crisis is not incontestable proof that 1 and 2 Thessalonians were composed then, but they certainly fit well with that period. If the initial explicit historical candidate for the Man of Lawlessness had been assassinated, and the associated explicit plan to desecrate the Jerusalem temple had collapsed, then it seems understandable that the Thessalonians would want information about the timing of the parousia of the Lord Jesus, and that they could be troubled further by a persuasive suggestion that that day had already come.

- In sum, it seems certain that 1 and 2 Thessalonians were composed after the Gaian crisis and, furthermore, since they presuppose teaching in those terms during the mission to Thessalonica, that the mission took place either during or after that crisis, hence sometime from 40 ce onward. Certain hints in the data then suggest placing this mission and the resulting correspondence — and consequently the Athenian mission as well — quite close to this terminus a quo rather than at the other end of the chronological window. We suspect, that is, that the Macedonian and Achaian missions took place in the early 40s ce, but this is a rather more tentative judgment.

- Three subsections are discernible within the longer principal treatment. First, Paul argues in 4:13-18 on the basis of Jesus’ resurrection that those who have died will be resurrected and included within the joyful reunion occurring at the Lord Jesus’ parousia. He then seems to respond, second, to a query from the Thessalonians that is reprised (at least in part) in 5:1 “concerning times and seasons” (περὶ . . . τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν). He replies to this somewhat cryptically that the day of the Lord will come “like a thief in the night . . . [when] destruction will fall on them [i.e., on those saying ‘peace and safety’] like birth pangs on a pregnant [and presumably full-term] woman” ([2] . . . ἡμέρα κυρίου ὡς κλέπτης ἐν νυκτὶ οὕτως ἔρχεται . . . [3] . . . αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ). Paul then segues in v. 4, in a third development, to place ethical pressure on the Thessalonians through v. 11. They do not in fact belong to the night, during which this thief might come unexpectedly and overwhelm them; they belong to the day, and so should not engage in drunken nocturnal revels but in lives of fidelity, affection, and hope. ([Location 5479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5479))

- The first subsection suggests that some Thessalonians were concerned about the deaths of community members. In his response, Paul supplies details concerning the parousia. It will be signaled by the shout of an archangel and a divine trumpet blast. The dead will then rise and will be caught up with the remaining living believers to meet the Lord “in the clouds” and, ultimately, “to be with him forever” (. . . ἐν νεφέλαις εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα· καὶ οὕτως πάντοτε σὺν κυρίῳ ἐσόμεθα). Most importantly, then, any dead within the community will certainly not be left behind or miss out on the reunion inaugurated by the parousia; they will, rather, be summoned, effectively from the ground, to join it.

- The second subsection is critical for our discussion. Paul is responding to a Thessalonian query that is frustratingly bland (“concerning times and seasons”; see Dan 2:21 and, more distantly, Wis 8:8).76 He suggests initially that it is superfluous for him to write anything, since they already know well, or “accurately” (ἀκριβῶς), that the parousia will come like a thief in the night.77 Hence, there seems to be an appeal here to preceding… ([Location 5498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5498))

- The narrative of a thief coming in the night is expanded in v. 3 by the narrative of a pregnant woman suddenly going into labor.79 This rush of events is then applied to surrounding non-Christians who are uttering what might be an idolatrous slogan from the imperial cult.80 They will not escape the sudden arrival of God’s anger at their wickedness. And after this, as we have already seen, Paul pivots in a third subsection into exhortation principally to avoid drunkenness based on the identification of the… ([Location 5506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5506))

- Paul’s point appears to be principally that the Thessalonians already know that, despite its drama, the actual parousia of the Lord Jesus will be sudden (αἰφνίδιος) and, in and of itself, unexpected, although principally for those outside the community. It seems possible, then, that he is simply resisting time-tabling this event.81 The stupendous happenings enumerated in the first subsection that will inaugurate the resurrection of at least the Christian dead, namely, shouting archangels and sounding heavenly trumpets, will erupt at the appropriate time, catching many non-Christians… ([Location 5513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5513))

- The Thessalonians seem to have been concerned about two things, and Paul with a third by way of further response. They were concerned about the fate of their dead in relation to Christ’s parousia. And they might also have wanted more specific information about its timing. Paul responds to these concerns directly, although more charitably to the first than to the second. The dead in Christ will certainly not miss out on the parousia but will be resurrected. However, the Thessalonians already know that the parousia of Christ will be sudden and unexpected. Moreover, Paul clearly remains concerned about certain aspects of… ([Location 5521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5521))

- The eschatological scenario in 1 Thessalonians assumes genuine anxiety on the part of some Thessalonians about their dead, but in the ancient world this would have been ubiquitous and could have arisen very quickly after the missionaries’ departure, or anytime thereafter. In 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 Paul presumably fills in something of a gap in their knowledge. That converts from paganism were not familiar with the resurrection of the dead in this early Christian variation seems quite understandable. He then seems to resist time-tabling the parousia of Jesus, appealing to an existing teaching about the suddenness of this event that evokes a standard Jewish metaphor for the end time, namely, labor pangs, in a story glossing the more dominical narrative of a thief or brigand robbing someone in the night. The unexpectedness of this event is oriented principally toward non-Christians, however ([Location 5543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5543))

- At no point does the text state that the Thessalonians themselves were to be taken by surprise, although the parousia of the Lord Jesus would be dramatic and sudden: “You brothers are not in darkness with the result that that day will overwhelm you like a brigand[’s attack].” ([Location 5552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5552))

- The eschatological scenario in 2 Thessalonians responds to an anxiety on the part of the Thessalonians that the parousia of Jesus had already come. Paul disproves this supposition by appealing to an eschatological timetable oriented by the Man of Lawlessness. Displaying the imprint of Jewish eschatological expectations tempered by the Maccabean era and, more recently, the Gaian crisis, Paul argues that this figure must be enthroned in the Jerusalem temple and blasphemously acclaimed as God, in the midst of a general apostasy, before the parousia of Christ can take place; in essence, this false parousia must precede the real one. Since it has not, Jesus’ parousia has not yet taken place; and Paul appeals again to earlier oral teaching. ([Location 5555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=5555))

- The book of Daniel carefully time-tables the final woes of Judea — but not the actual arrival of the end. So Paul may well have taught the Thessalonian community during his founding visit that certain key woes had to fall on the world before the parousia of the Lord Jesus, namely, the desecration of the temple by the Man of Lawlessness, who seems to have been narrated, at least initially, with respect to the evil emperor Gaius, and that after this set of dramatic and palpable events, the Lord Jesus would return suddenly and dramatically, catching up his community to meet him in the clouds and ultimately to be with him forever.

- The Thessalonians could first have been unsettled by a deceptive suggestion from a spiteful neighbor that the Lord Jesus had already returned. Paul would then have reiterated in 2 Thessalonians his original eschatological timetable in relation to the Man of Lawlessness to reassure them, perhaps with a degree of exasperation. Obviously, the Lord Jesus had not yet returned, because the temple desecration had not yet taken place. Some Thessalonians might then have become concerned about the dead, possibly because a child had died or was dying, or in view of some illness.

- It seems likely, given this conclusion, that 2 Thessalonians was written soon after 1 Thessalonians. Only a short time interval explains plausibly the silence in 2 Thessalonians concerning the promised visit, which is badly needed and has yet to take place, and the brusque breach of other key features of ancient relationality and epistolary etiquette. In this location, effectively right after 1 Thessalonians, there is no need to reiterate the statements of longing or requests for prayer made in 1 Thessalonians — they still stand — or to explain that circumstances preventing this visit have not changed. Indeed, with a short lapse of time, the probability that the same obstructive circumstances are still in place is high. Thus, the silence of 2 Thessalonians concerning the promised and expected second visit of Paul to Thessalonica is explicable if 2 Thessalonians follows quite hard on the heels of 1 Thessalonians.

- the case for the letter’s Ephesian addressees is rather weak. The main uncials, p46, and the earliest traceable patristic comments are all against this identification. ([Location 7419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7419))
- Corroborating a suspicion of later emendation, many of its witnesses seem to have harmonized the addressees further in the light of Romans 1:7 (πᾶσιν τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν Ῥώμῃ ἀγαπητοῖς θεοῦ, κλητοῖς ἁγίοις . . .). So an Ephesian address should be tabled initially in favor of variations 1, 2, and 3. ([Location 7421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7421))
- general address created with an unnecessary participle of being. But we are in the happy position of having such a location supplied in what is easily our earliest attested variant by way of Marcion, and so, at the latest, deriving from the mid-second century — namely, Laodicea.65 Moreover, we can even go on to offer a plausible explanation for the elimination of this address in the next phase of scribal work as Paul’s letters were transmitted. It could well have been thought inappropriate that an apostolic letter should address a church that the book of Revelation exposed later to be such an abject failure (see Rev. 3:15-18 in the context of 3:14-22 — Harnack’s view, which I find plausible; the much later insertion of Ephesus into the address might then be attributable to the influence of Rev as well [see the glowing account of the Ephesian church in Rev. 2:1-7] ([Location 7441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7441))
- Alternatively, this emphatically ecclesial letter could simply have been generalized, as Romans was. ([Location 7448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7448))
- we will proceed for the time being on the assumption that the original addressees of our canonical Ephesians were actually the Laodiceans, and will consequently refer from this point onward to canonical Ephesians as Laodiceans ([Location 7452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7452))
- Paul’s address throughout the letter is nevertheless highly consistent in general terms; the letter’s addressees are identified as pagan converts in the specific sense of being ([Location 7461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7461))
- Paul is currently incarcerated close by, something he mentions three times overtly (3:1, and see also 13; 4:1; 6:19-20). This is of course a plausible location for Paul when composing a letter. Of the nine letters currently judged authentic, three were written from an imprisonment. ([Location 7471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7471))
- Paul had been imprisoned not far from these converts, before he had reached their town. So he had had no personal contact with them yet and no influence on their formation. However, technically these converts still fell under his apostolic jurisdiction; Paul was a recognized authority on pagan conversion (Gal 2:1-10, esp. 8-9), and certainly he would have viewed matters in this way. It seems to be this situation that creates the rather fascinating and distinctive exigence for Laodiceans. ([Location 7482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7482))
- because of Paul’s imprisonment, they would have to be instructed by letter in lieu of a personal visit. Hence, Paul composed Laodiceans ([Location 7487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=7487))

- Thus, the letter to the Colossians no longer addresses just the Colossians, its explicit recipients, but will address the audience of Laodiceans as well; and vice versa, the letter to the Laodiceans will address the audience of Colossians.

- Laodiceans was elicited by particular circumstances that called most directly for an exposition of Paul’s most coherent concerns — in effect, for his construction of the Christian identity of a community of pagan converts. Moreover, this letter fits into the frame just prior to Paul’s year of crisis, that is, in 50 ce, preceding the troubles of spring 51-spring 52, when 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, and Romans were composed.

- Once it is grasped that the Laodiceans had not been converted by Paul, and barely knew him, and that Paul was prevented from instructing them by his incarceration, and may in turn have known very little about them, the scene is set in quite specific terms for a highly generalized discussion — an account of Christian identity for pagan converts. The key to Ephesians in this relation is then its hidden identity as Laodiceans, along with the location of the Laodiceans in relation to Paul.

- This motif is poorly translated as “the church,” a rendering that will instantly generate a spectrum of anachronistic connotations. It is actually a reference to an assembly or gathering, and hence, in its singular usage, to the assembly, drawing here most probably on the OT notion of the assembly of all Israel (qahal Israel). This was thought by many in Paul’s day to be eschatologically consummated and hence could well have been appropriated by the first followers of Jesus to define themselves.

- there is an evident concern to locate the Christian community in a tightly unified way alongside converts from Judaism. These two groups convert from the same desperate location (2:1-5; see also vv. 11-12) and then form one single body and temple (2:15b, 18), having had their mutual hostility put to death (2:14, 16). Moreover, this unity between Jew and pagan is reinforced by the letter’s later calls for communal unity (4:3-6). The letter breathes a certain sort of ecumenicity.

- According to our frame, Laodiceans was written during an incarceration in 50 ce, while Paul was returning to the Aegean from a critical meeting in Jerusalem that took place in turn on the heels of a dramatic confrontation in Syrian Antioch over the status of Paul’s pagan converts. Thus, it is possible that the carefully nuanced account of Christian unity found in Laodiceans may reflect in part these meetings that had just preceded it. (Certainly, they would have informed it.)84 And it is important to recall that the immediate outcome of Paul’s second visit to Jerusalem was positive. The leaders of the two main missions in the early church — to Jews and to pagans — had shaken hands in a binding mutual acknowledgment of their participation in a society together (Gal 2:1-10, esp. vv. 8-9), and the collection was now tangible evidence of Paul’s and his pagan converts’ commitment to that society. Hence, arguably, the carefully nuanced account of communal unity found in Laodiceans, embracing the execution within the assembly of the enmity often existing in general between Jews and pagans, fits this situation like the proverbial hand in a glove — and may in turn shed light on some of the content of those earlier meetings, which was so critical and yet whose attestation is so limited.85 That is, the presence of both the Jewish and the “ecumenical” material in Laodiceans seems well explained by its location in our broader letter sequence just after the Jerusalem conference.

- the letter now falls, like Colossians and Philemon, in Paul’s mission to Asia that took place just after the important events surrounding his second visit to Jerusalem, but prior to the tempestuous year of crisis that unfolded through 51 and the spring of 52 ce, the year in which he wrote most of his extant letters.

- Nevertheless, we are now working with a “ten-letter canon” — in chronological sequence, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, Laodiceans/Colossians/Philemon, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, and Romans. And if this judgment proves correct, I recommend that Bibles and New Testaments be amended accordingly. (There is of course nothing sacred about a letter’s later canonical designation.) Paul did not write a letter to the Ephesians, and it causes a lot of trouble to think that he did so. The letter so designated was sent to the Laodiceans as referenced by Colossians 4:16b.

- The sequence has an early cluster of letters, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, which must be dated after the Gaian crisis although not necessarily well after it. Written from Athens to stabilize the struggling Thessalonians, these letters were probably penned just after the Macedonian mission and in the midst of the Achaian mission, both of which were unfolding through the late 30s and early 40s, as the Gaian intimations suggest. They are remarkably early sources for the early Christian movement, which attest, furthermore, to its extraordinarily rapid diversification and spread through the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean basin. On the basis of information in Galatians, we were also able to posit an important narrative segment just prior to these missions and their letters, namely, Paul’s call near Damascus and subsequent missionary activity in Arabia, Syria, and Cilicia. Paul’s first visit to Jerusalem took place at this time as well, along with his escape from Damascus. So a sequence of events and letters spreading across several years, through roughly 34-41 ce, composes the first part of the frame.

- But Paul does come back into focus in 50, just after a confrontation at Antioch with Cephas, followed by his second visit to Jerusalem in late 49 or early 50, at which time the collection project so apparent in his later longer letters is initiated (so Gal 2:10). By mid-50 we find Paul incarcerated on his way back from Syrian Antioch and Jerusalem to the Aegean, most likely in Apamea or a city like it and close by the Lycus valley. From prison Paul writes a cluster of letters — Laodiceans (“Ephesians”), Colossians, and Philemon — to fledgling communities in the Lycus valley, whose circumstances were notably distinctive.

- of any letter extant, Laodiceans is a unique introduction to the Pauline way for those who knew next to nothing about it. However, as this letter was being crafted — quite possibly as an oral/aural event composed for much of the time in the darkness of a detention cell — an emergency arose at a small congregation of a Pauline nature founded by proxy at Colossae. So Paul, heavily informed by his initial composition, composed another, briefer letter — Colossians — more specifically directed to an unhelpful intrusive teaching. And he wrote an even shorter letter to Philemon, the owner of the troubled slave Onesimus, who had brought him all this disturbing information, although the letter also addresses Philemon’s wife (or sister), Apphia, and the leader of their house church, Archippus. Moreover, Paul instructed that the two main letters be read at both destinations, thereby effecting an integrated epistolary event in which the roles of both explicit… ([Location 9972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=9972))

- seems to have washed through his communities and even threatened him directly. The first wave was the contentious period Paul experienced vis-à-vis the Corinthian congregation. We found a minimal account of Paul’s management of this conflict to be the most plausible, but even that is complex enough. Beginning in 50 ce, after his release from an Apamean incarceration, visit to the Lycus valley communities, and arrival in Ephesus, Paul penned a letter to the Corinthians that has not been preserved. This letter, which we designated the Previous Letter to Corinth, seems to have articulated, among other things, instructions about the collection. The Corinthians responded somewhat assertively with a written reply, and several oral reports of varying loyalty seem also to have reached Paul in Ephesus at this time. One of the difficult factors in play at Corinth seems to have been a group of followers of another leader, probably Apollos. As a result, Paul seems to have decided “to triangulate” the fractured and deteriorating situation, traveling to see the Corinthians by way of Macedonia so he could, at the least, arrive with a posse of loyal Macedonians at his back. In the meantime, Timothy (presumably) took a stinging letter to the Corinthians in Paul’s stead — our 1 Corinthians. Paul then left Asia a little earlier than planned after some sudden crisis (2 Cor 1:8-9) but arrived to good news when he met up with Titus in Macedonia, who was returning from Corinth in a clockwise direction around the Aegean; he had been sent to monitor the aftereffects of the devastating “Letter of Tears.” Indeed, in response to the success of his epistolary strategy at Corinth with 1 Corinthians / the Letter of Tears, Paul penned another letter, our 2 Corinthians, in which it is clear that not everything had been resolved. Arguably a small group of Corinthian converts remained deeply hostile to Paul, not to mention archly abusive,… ([Location 9983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=9983))

- group of hostile Jewish Christian missionaries seems to have arrived on Paul’s doorstep, seeking to subvert his congregations and attack him (see perhaps Gal 2:4; more certainly, 5:7-12). Paul responded in part by penning a volley of letters to the congregations he suspected had been turned, or who might yet be threatened. The Galatians, who were said to have abandoned Paul’s gospel (at least in his mind), received a powerful letter. And the Philippians received a stringent exhortation to vigilance — what we have called the Previous Letter to Philippi — which has been lost but was fortuitously preserved in part when Paul quoted it in another letter written to the Philippians (Phil 3:2–4:3). Indeed, Paul soon wrote a… ([Location 10001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=10001))

But to preempt an arrival in the meantime of his enemies at Rome, and a resultant disruption of his plan to set out from that city to evangelize Spain and the northwestern quadrant of the empire, Paul wrote a comprehensive account of his gospel over against their inadequate and moralizing ethic — our Romans — and dispatched it to the Roman… ([Location 10008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091L2BMW6&location=10008))
