### Highlights

- The problem is to explain the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly democratic in its politics, capitalist in its economy, libertarian in its laws, individualist in its society and pluralistic in its culture. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=227))
- The first was an exodus of Puritans from the east of England to Massachusetts during a period of eleven years from 1629 to 1640. The second was the migration of a small Royalist elite and large numbers of indentured servants from the south of England to Virginia (ca. 1642-75). The third was a movement from the North Midlands of England and Wales to the Delaware Valley (ca. 1675-1725). The fourth was a flow of English-speaking people from the borders of North Britain and northern Ireland to the Appalachian backcountry mostly during the half-century from 1718 to 1775.

- These four groups shared many qualities in common. All of them spoke the English language. Nearly all were British Protestants. Most lived under British laws and took pride in possessing British liberties. At the same time, they also differed from one another in many other ways: in their religious denominations, social ranks, historical generations, and also in the British regions from whence they came. They carried across the Atlantic four different sets of British folkways which became the basis of regional cultures in the New World. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=255))
- Most important for the political history of the United States, they also had four different conceptions of order, power and freedom which became the cornerstones of a voluntary society in British America. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=260))
- That is the central thesis of this book: the legacy of four British folkways in early America remains the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society in the United States today. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=266))

- In this work “folkway” will have a different meaning. It is defined here as the normative structure of values, customs and meanings that exist in any culture. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=273))
- In the modern world a folkway is apt to be a cultural artifact—the conscious instrument of human will and purpose. Often (and increasingly today) it is also the deliberate contrivance of a cultural elite. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=276))
- Folkways are often highly persistent, but they are never static. Even where they have acquired the status of a tradition they are not necessarily very old. Folkways are constantly… ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=279))
- Folkways in this normative sense exist in advanced civilizations as well as in primitive societies. They are functioning systems of high complexity which have actually grown… ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=281))
- In any given culture, they always include the following things: —Speech ways, conventional patterns of written and spoken language: pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax and grammar. —Building ways, prevailing forms of vernacular architecture and high architecture, which tend to be related to one another. —Family ways, the structure and function of the household and family, both in ideal and actuality. —Marriage ways, ideas of the marriage-bond, and cultural processes of courtship, marriage and divorce. —Gender ways, customs that regulate social relations between men and women. —Sex ways, conventional sexual attitudes and acts, and the treatment of sexual deviance. —Child-rearing ways, ideas of child nature and customs of child nurture. —Naming ways, onomastic customs including favored forenames and the descent of names within the family. —Age ways, attitudes toward age, experiences of aging, and age relationships. —Death ways, attitudes toward death, mortality rituals, mortuary customs and mourning practices. —Religious ways, patterns of religious worship, theology, ecclesiology and church architecture. —Magic ways, normative beliefs and practices concerning the supernatural. —Learning ways, attitudes toward literacy and learning, and conventional patterns of education. —Food ways, patterns of diet, nutrition, cooking, eating, feasting and fasting. —Dress ways, customs of dress, demeanor, and personal adornment. —Sport ways, attitudes toward recreation and leisure; folk games and forms of organized sport. —Work ways, work ethics and work experiences; attitudes toward work and the nature of work. —Time ways, attitudes toward the use of time, customary methods of time keeping, and the conventional rhythms of life. —Wealth ways, attitudes toward wealth and patterns of its distribution. —Rank ways, the rules by which rank… ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=282))
- Every major culture in the modern world has its own distinctive customs in these many areas. Their persistent power might be illustrated by an example. Consider the case of wealth distribution. Most social scientists believe that the distribution of wealth is determined primarily by material conditions. For Marxists the prime mover is thought to be the means of production; for Keynesians it is the process of economic growth; for disciples of Adam Smith it is the market mechanism. But to study this subject in a comparative way is to discover that the distribution of wealth has varied from one culture to another in ways that cannot possibly be… ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=303))
- These wealth ways are communicated from one generation to the next by many interlocking mechanisms—child-rearing processes, institutional structures, cultural ethics, and codes of law—which create ethical imperatives of great… ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=309))

- Indeed, the more advanced a society becomes in material terms, the stronger is the determinant power of its folkways, for modern technologies act as amplifiers, and modern institutions as stabilizers, and modern… ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=311))
- The same historical pattern appears in the American south. However different that region may be from New England, it also has preserved its own distinctive folkways through many generations. Something similar also happened in the American midlands, and in the American west. Throughout all four of these broad areas we find the same processes of cultural persistence, variability and adaptability that William Graham Sumner observed in New England. Even as the ethnic composition of these various regions of the United States has changed profoundly, regional cultures themselves have persisted, and are still very powerful even in our own time. All of them derive from folkways that were planted in the American colonies more than two centuries ago. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=321))
- If these folkways are to be understood truly, they must be described empirically—that is, by reference to evidence which can be verified or falsified. In this work, descriptive examples are presented in the text for illustrative purposes, and empirical indicators are summarized in the notes.10 Not all of these folkways can be treated empirically, but the work of many scholars has produced a broad range of historical evidence for each of the four major cultures in British America. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=326))
- Massachusetts chose its colonists with care. Not everyone was allowed to settle there. In doubtful cases, the founders of the colony actually demanded written proof of good character. This may have been the only English colony that required some of its immigrants to submit letters of recommendation. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=498))
- To a remarkable degree, the founders of Massachusetts traveled in families—more so than any major ethnic group in American history. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=503))
- more than 40 percent of immigrants to the Massachusetts Bay Colony were mature men and women over twenty-five, and nearly half were children under sixteen. Only a few migrants were past the age of sixty, but in every other way the distribution of ages was remarkably similar to England’s population in general. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=516))
- Also unusual was the distribution of sexes, which differed very much from most colonial populations. The gender ratio of European migrants to Virginia was four men for every woman. In New Spain it was ten men for every woman; in Brazil, one hundred men for every Portuguese woman. Only a small minority of immigrants in those colonies could hope to live in households such as they had left behind in Europe. But in the Puritan migration to Massachusetts, the gender ratio was approximately 150 males for every 100 females. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=519))
- From an early date, normal family life was not the exception but the rule. As early as 1635, the Congregational churches of New England had more female than male members. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=523))
- In terms of social rank, most emigrants to Massachusetts came from the middling strata of English society. Only a few were of the aristocracy. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=527))
- The great majority were yeomen, husbandmen, artisans, craftsmen, merchants and traders—the sturdy middle class of England. They were not poor. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=532))
- Remarkably few of these migrants came from the bottom of English society, to the surprise of some immigrants themselves. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=536))
- The leaders of the great migration actively discouraged servants and emigrants of humble means. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=541))
- As a result of this policy, nearly three-quarters of adult Massachusetts immigrants paid their own passage—no small sum in 1630. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=547))
- The social status of these people also appeared in their high levels of literacy. Two-thirds of New England’s adult male immigrants were able to sign their own names. In old England before 1640, only about one-third could do so. By this very rough “signature-mark test,” literacy was nearly twice as common in Massachusetts as in the mother country. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=551))
- These colonists were also extraordinary in their occupations. A solid majority (between 50 and 60%) had been engaged in some skilled craft or trade before leaving England. Less than one-third had been employed primarily in agriculture—a small proportion for a seventeenth-century population. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=561))
- This was mainly an urban migration. Approximately one-third of the founders of Massachusetts came from small market towns in England. Another third came from large towns—a much greater proportion than in the English population as a whole. Less than 30 percent had lived in manorial villages, and a very small proportion had dwelled on separate farms. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=567))
- In summary, by comparison with other emigrant groups in American history, the great migration to Massachusetts was a remarkably homogeneous movement of English Puritans who came from the middle ranks of their society, and traveled in family groups. The heads of these families tended to be exceptionally literate, highly skilled, and heavily urban in their English origins. They were a people of substance, character, and deep personal piety. The special quality of New England’s regional culture would owe much to these facts. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=570))
- Another important fact about the founders of Massachusetts was their region of origin in the mother country. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=575))
- But closer study shows that some counties contributed more than others, and that one region in particular accounted for a majority of the founders of Massachusetts. It lay in the east of England. We may take its geographic center to be the market town of Haverhill, very near the point where the three counties of Suffolk, Essex and Cambridge come together. A circle drawn around the town of Haverhill with a radius of sixty miles will circumscribe the area from which most New England families came. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=579))
- The concentration of Puritans from East Anglia, and from the county of Suffolk, was especially great in the Winthrop Fleet of 1630.8 In the New World, their hegemony became very strong in the present boundaries of Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex and Middlesex counties in Massachusetts. This area became the heartland of its region; its communities are called “seed towns” in New England because so many other communities were founded from them. Most families in these seed towns came from the east of England. The majority was highly concentrated in its regional origin while the minority was widely scattered. As a consequence, the East Anglian core of New England’s population had a cultural importance greater even than its numbers would suggest. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=608))
- This predominance of England’s eastern counties was even stronger among the Puritan elite. Of 129 university-trained ministers and magistrates in the great migration, 56 percent had lived in the seven eastern counties of Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and Kent before sailing to America. Only 9 percent were Londoners. The rest had been widely scattered through many parts of England. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=632))
- Altogether, 78 percent of New England’s college-trained ministers and magistrates had been born, bred, schooled, married, or employed for long periods in seven eastern counties. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=637))
- Many of its members had known one another before coming to America. They had gone to the same schools. Nearly half had studied in three Cambridge Colleges—Emmanuel, Magdalen and Trinity. Approximately 30 percent had attended Emmanuel alone. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=640))
- Several of these genealogical connections were especially important in the history of New England. One centered on the county of Suffolk and included the families of Winthrop, Downing, Rainborough, Tyndal and Fones. A second connection had its base in Emmanuel College and united a large number of eminent Puritan divines, including Samuel Stone, Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, John Wilson and Roger Newton, all of whom came to New England. These men had known each other at Cambridge. Most had held livings in East Anglia and had been removed for their Puritan beliefs. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=643))
- The spiritual leader of this flock was the Reverend John Cotton, vicar of Boston’s St. Botolph’s church—the largest parish church in England. Its tremendous tower called Boston Stump, 272 feet high, served mariners as a seamark, and the Puritans as a spiritual beacon. On Sundays the Marburys and Hutchinsons traveled twenty miles through the Lincoln fens toward Boston Stump where they heard John Cotton preach from the beautiful pulpit that still stands in the church.5 ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=655))
- In Massachusetts, these various Puritan connections were soon united in a single cousinage. Genealogists have remarked upon “the vast number of unions between the members of the families of Puritan ministers.” One commented that “it seemed to be a law of social ethics that the sons of ministers should marry the daughters of ministers.” Mathers, Cottons, Stoddards, Eliots, ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=659))
- The matriarch of this family, Sarah Story Cotton Mather, might be taken as the genealogical center of New England’s elite. By the mid-eighteenth century many leading families in eastern Massachusetts were related to her by linear or collateral descent.7 Important marriages joined the Mather-Cotton dynasty to the Dudleys, Bradstreets, Winthrops, Sewalls and other leading families in Massachusetts. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=671))
- This was the cousinage that governed Massachusetts. It went to the same schools, visited constantly with one another, joined in the same working associations, and dominated the public life of the Bay Colony for many generations. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=675))
- The ministers who belonged to this cousinage were forbidden to hold political office. But in every other way their power was very great. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=677))
- This region also became a major center of resistance to Charles I after 1625. When the Civil War began in 1642, Parliamentary forces found their greatest strength in the counties called the Eastern Association—the same area from which Massachusetts was settled. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=729))
- The religious life of this region also differed from other parts of England. It had been marked by dissent for centuries before Martin Luther. During the early fifteenth century, the movement called Lollardy found many of its followers in East Anglia. After its suppression, the underground cells of Lollards who met to study the scriptures were exceptionally numerous in eastern counties from Lincoln and Norfolk to Kent. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=732))
- The Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century also flourished in East Anglia, more than elsewhere in England. The Marian martyrs—men and women executed for their Protestant faith in the reign of the Queen Mary—came mostly from this region. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=735))
- Of 273 Protestants who were burned at the stake for heresy during the counter reformation of the Catholic Queen (1553-58), no fewer than 225 (82%) came from nine eastern counties. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=737))
- In the era of Elizabeth I, nearly half of Puritan ministers came from the East Anglian counties of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. If other eastern counties were included, the proportion rose to 75 percent.16 ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=738))
- When John Winthrop described his intended settlement in Massachusetts as “a city upon a hill,” he employed a gospel phrase that had become a cliché in the communities of eastern England. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=747))
- The Puritanism of eastern England was not all of a piece. Several distinct varieties of religious dissent developed there, each with its own base. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=749))
- A special strain of religious radicalism which put heavy stress upon the spirit (Antinomianism) flourished among Puritans in eastern Lincolnshire. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=750))
- The more conservative and highly rationalist variant of Calvinism (Arminianism) found many adherents in London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=751))
- In between were men and women from the counties of Suffolk, Essex and Norfolk who adopted a Puritan “middle way.” Their faith became the official religion of Massachusetts for two centuries. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=752))
- East Anglia was also exceptional in its educational and cultural attainments. In the seventeenth century, rates of literacy were higher there than in other English regions. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=754))
- So high was mortality among African immigrants in New England that race slavery was not viable on a large scale, despite many attempts to introduce it. Slavery was not impossible in this region, but the human and material costs were higher than many wished to pay. A labor system which was fundamentally hostile to the Puritan ethos of New England was kept at bay partly by the climate.6 ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=812))
- In remote corners of East Anglia today, country folk still speak in a harsh, high-pitched, nasal accent unkindly called the “Norfolk whine.” This dialect is the survivor of a family of accents that were heard throughout the east of England in the seventeenth century, from the fens of east Lincolnshire to the coast of Kent. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=887))
- In the Puritan great migration, these English speech ways were carried to Massachusetts, where they mixed with one another and merged with other elements. During the seventeenth century, they spread rapidly throughout New England, and became the basis of a new regional accent called the Yankee twang. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=890))
- This Yankee accent also tended to be exceptionally harsh and high-pitched. The early American orthographer John Pickering described it as “a sort of nasal twang.” The English traveler John Lambert agreed that it was “a nasal twang.” It had, as James Russell Lowell observed, a “partiality for nasals.” ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=896))
- The rhyme-schemes of New England poets in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries tell us that glare was pronounced glar; hair was har; air was ar; and war rhymed with star. Other common pronunciations were hev for have, yistidy for yesterday, ginral for general, dafter or darter for daughter, drownd for drown, gownd for gown, Americur for America and kiver for cover. Peace officers were addressed as cunstibles. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=900))
- Yankee speech owed much of its distinctive character to its pronunciation of the letter r. Postvocalic r’s tended to disappear altogether, so that Harvard became Haa-v’d (with the a pronounced as in happen). This speech-habit came from East Anglia and may still be heard in the English counties of Suffolk, Norfolk and Kent. At the same time, other r’s were added. ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=906))
- The character of this pattern derived in large measure from the influence of an East Anglian elite who became ministers and magistrates in the Puritan colonies. One bizarre indicator of their influence was a layer of Latinate complexity that came to be grafted upon the language of New England. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=921))
- The people of Massachusetts were constantly bombarded with this pedantry. Every Sunday they sat with bowed heads while showers of polysyllables rained down upon them from the pulpit. Inspired by this show of Cambridge learning, the country people of New England studded their speech with quasi-classical folk-coinages of their own invention such as rambunctious, absquatulate, splendiferous, and many other words ending in ize, ous, ulate, ical, iction, acious, iferous, and ticate. Language of this sort became a distinguishing mark of New England speech, ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=926))
- The postvocalic r still tends to disappear in rural East Anglia, and traces of Yankee speech may yet be heard in every part of America where the children of the Puritan great migration pitched their homes. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=935))
- The people of Massachusetts thought of the family not as an end in itself, but as an instrument of their highest religious purposes. The Puritan writer Jonathan Mitchell declared, “a Christian may and ought to desire many things as means, but God alone as his end.”2 This was their way of thinking about the family in particular, which was also described as “the root whence church and commonwealth cometh.” ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1012))
- Concern for the family in this culture was also given a special intensity by an attitude which historian Edmund Morgan calls “Puritan tribalism,” that is, the Hebraic idea that the founders of New England were God’s chosen people. The Puritans were encouraged by their ministers to think of themselves as “the saints,” and to believe that grace descended to their children. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1016))
- Two centuries after the great migration, Harriet Beecher Stowe observed:   among the peculiarly English ideas which the Colonists brought to Massachusetts, which all the wear and tear of democracy have not been able to obliterate, was that of family. Family feeling, family pride, family hope and fear and desire, were, in my early day, strongly-marked traits. Genealogy was a thing at the tip of every person’s tongue, and in every person’s mind. … “Of a very respectable family,” was a sentence so often repeated at the old fireside that its influence went in part to make up my character.6 ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1024))
- New England’s interest in genealogy was not the same as that of high-born families in England or Virginia. It was not a pride in rank and quarterings, but a moral and religious idea that developed directly from the Puritan principles of the founders. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1030))
- The builders of the Bay Colony cast their idea of the family in terms of the covenant theology which was so central to their faith. They believed that God’s covenant with each individual Christian was enlarged into another sort of contract which they called the family covenant. John Cotton explained, “God hath made a covenant with parents and householders,” which bound them not only on their own account, but also in regard to “wives, and children, and servants, and kindred, and acquaintances, and all that are under our reach, either by way of subordination, or coordination.” ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1032))
- Thus, the covenanted family became a complex web of mutual obligations between husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. The clarity of this contractual idea, the rigor of its enforcement and especially the urgency of its spiritual purpose, set New England Puritans apart from other people—even from other Calvinists—in the Western world. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1037))
- Like most of their contemporaries, the Puritans thought of the family as a concentric set of nuclear and extended rings. But within that conventional idea, they gave special importance to the innermost nuclear ring. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1040))
- Similar tendencies also appeared in customs of inheritance, which were more nuclear in New England than in other American colonies during the seventeenth century. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1044))
- One study of 168 wills in Newbury, Massachusetts, for example, found that only 6.5 percent left bequests to a niece or nephew, and 3.0 percent to other kin. None whatever bequeathed property to a cousin—a pattern different from the Chesapeake colonies.10 ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1045))
- The same nuclear pattern also appeared in the composition of households. By comparison with other colonies, households throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut included large numbers of children, small numbers of servants and high proportions of intact marital unions. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1048))
- The number of servants in New England, however, was very small—less than one per family. At any given time, most households in this region had no servants at all—a pattern very different from the Chesapeake and Delaware colonies. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1054))
- In short, the New England household more closely coincided with the nuclear unit, and the nuclear family was larger and stronger than elsewhere in the Western world. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1055))
- The strength of the nuclear unit was merely one of many special features of New England families. Another was a strong sense of collective responsibility for maintaining its individual integrity. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1057))
- The people of the Bay Colony worked through many institutions to preserve what they called “family order” and “family government” within each nuclear unit. Other cultures also shared these concerns, but once again Puritan New England did things in its own way, with a special intensity of purpose. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1058))
- The selectmen and constables of each town were required by law to inspect families on a regular basis. Where “good order” broke down within a household, their task was to restore it. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1060))
- In nuclear families that were persistently “disorderly”—a word that covered a multitude of misdeeds—the selectmen were required to remove the children and servants and place them in other homes. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1061))
- In the second generation, responsibility for inspecting families passed from selectmen to special town officers called tithingmen. A statute in 1675 ordered that each tithingman “shall take charge of ten or Twelve families of his Neighborhood, and shall diligently inspect them.” This office did not exist in Anglican Virginia or Quaker Pennsylvania. But it was not a New England innovation. Tithingmen had long existed as parish functionaries in East Anglia and other parts of England. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1065))
- So important was the idea of a covenanted family in Massachusetts that everyone was compelled by law to live in family groups. ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1069))
- The provinces of Connecticut and Plymouth also forbade any single person to “live of himself.”14 These laws were enforced. In 1668 the court of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, systematically searched its towns for single persons and placed them in families. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1075))
- This custom was not invented in New England. It had long been practiced in East Anglia. From as early as 1562 to the midseventeenth century, The High Constables’ Sessions and Quarter Courts of Essex County in England had taken similar action against “single men,” “bachelors,” and “masterless men.” The Puritans took over this custom and endowed it with the spiritual intensity of their faith. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1083))
- Family order was an hierarchical idea to the people of the Bay Colony. In that belief they were typical of their age. But the structure of that hierarchy had a special cast in their thinking. In Puritan New England, the family hierarchy had more to do with age, and less with gender and rank, than in other English-speaking cultures. ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1087))
- Families in Massachusetts did not dine together. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich discovered that in New England “servants and children … sat down to eat after their master and mistress.” This, as we shall discover, differed from table customs in other Anglo-American cultures. ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1090))
- The same hierarchy of ages also appeared in sleeping arrangements. Adults and heads of families slept on the ground floor in rooms called the parlor or principal chamber. Children commonly slept in upstairs, in lofts or low rooms. Architectural historians find that this arrangement was typical of East Anglia, but not of other regions in England. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1092))
- This hierarchy of age within the family was written into the laws of Massachusetts, which in 1648 required the death penalty as a punishment for stubborn or rebellious sons over the age of sixteen who refused to obey either their father or mother. The same punishment was also provided for children who struck or cursed their parents. ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1100))
- No child was ever executed under this law, but several were fined or whipped by the courts for being rude or abusive to their parents. Some of these errant “children” were in their forties, and their parents were of advanced age. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1102))
- The intensity of these Puritan beliefs in the covenanted family as an instrument of larger purposes, and in the instrumental family as primarily a nuclear unit, and also in the nuclear family as a hierarchy of age all distinguished the family… ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1107))
- Marriage customs in Massachusetts were not what one might expect to find in a new country. Despite the vast abundance of land, young people did not rush to tie the knot. By comparison with other colonies, age at first marriage was remarkably advanced. After the first few years of settlement, men tended to marry at the age of 26, and… ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1112))
- Marriage was delayed ten years beyond puberty but nearly everyone married—94 percent of women, and 98 percent of New England men.2 This pattern which seems natural to us today was very different from western Europe in the mid-seventeenth century. In that rigid and rank-bound society, many young men and women were never able to marry at any age… ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1117))
- The marriage imperative was strong in this culture. Women who did not find a partner by the age of thirty were called “thornbacks” in Massachusetts—as they had been in England. Worse, Puritans suspected… ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1124))
- Behind these demographic patterns was a cultural idea of marriage that was unique to the Puritan colonies. The Church of England had taught that matrimony was a sacred union that must be solemnized by a priest. Anglicans also insisted that after the sacred knot was firmly tied, it could never be “put asunder” by mortal hands. Exceptions were allowed for monarchs and great lords, but for… ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1127))
- The Puritans of New England rejected all of these Anglican ideas. They believed that marriage was not a religious ceremony but a civil contract. They required that this covenant must be “agreed” or “executed” (not “performed” or “solemnized”) before a magistrate, and not a minister. They also insisted that if the terms of the marriage covenant were broken, then the union could be ended by divorce. These attitudes became the basis of regional marriage customs throughout New England. But they were not invented in America, or even in England. William Bradford noted that they were established “according to the laudable custom of the low countries,”… ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1131))
- The Puritans required in most cases that both parents and children must give their free consent to marriage. Massachusetts courts fined children for an offense called “self-marriage,” which meant marrying without the consent of parents or magistrates. But parents were forbidden to withhold their approval arbitrarily; in some… ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1138))
- By and large, Puritan parents did not arrange the marriages of their children. Suitors carefully sought the consent of parents before beginning a courtship,… ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1143))
- But in their bluff and awkward way, the Puritans cherished true love, and insisted that it was a prerequisite of a happy marriage.12 The Puritans used the expression “falling in love.” They believed that love should normally precede marriage. Their courtship rituals were designed to promote this order of events. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1150))
- Customs of courtship in New England were carefully designed to allow young people privacy enough to discover if they loved one another, at the same time that parents maintained close supervision. This was the purpose of “bundling,” a European custom which became widespread in New England. The courting couple were put to bed together, “tarrying” all night with a “bundling board” between them. Sometimes the young woman’s legs were bound together in a “bundling stocking” which fitted her body like a glove. ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1157))
- Another regional custom was the “courting stick,” a hollow pole six or eight feet long, with an earpiece at one end and a mouthpiece at the other. The courting couple whispered quietly to one another through this tube, while members of the family remained in the room nearby. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1162))
- The apparatus of courtship in New England had a double purpose—to combine close supervision by elders with free choice by the young. To that end, New Englanders invented the courting stick, a tube six or eight feet long with an open bell at each end. A New England antiquarian wrote more than a century ago, “in the presence of the entire family, lovers seated formally on either side of the great fireplace carried on this chilly telephonic love-making. One of these batons of propriety still is preserved in Long Meadow, Massachusetts.” ([Location 1165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1165))
- Other folk inventions were the bed board, bundling stocking and bundling apron. A courting couple were securely “bundled” together in a bed with a wooden board between them. Sometimes the young woman’s legs were securely fastened together in a bundling stocking, or wrapped in a bundling apron which left the upper body exposed. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1169))
- Bundling boards and courting sticks were not merely pieces of amusing social trivia. These two ingenious folk-inventions were instruments of an important cultural purpose. They were designed to reconcile two requirements of New England courtship—the free consent of the young, and strict supervision by their… ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1174))
- After the courtship was complete, the ritual of the wedding in Massachusetts began with a betrothal ceremony which was called the “precontract” in Plymouth and the “contraction” in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Cotton Mather explained: “There was maintained a solemnity called a Contraction a little before the consummation of a marriage was allowed of. A Pastor was usually employed and a sermon was preached on this occasion.”16 This… ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1177))
- Betrothed couples were also required to post their “banns” (a public announcement) at the meeting house on at least three lecture days. Those who failed to do so risked punishment for “disorderly marriage.”… ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1183))
- The wedding was performed at home by a magistrate in a simple civil ceremony. There were no holy vows or wedding rings—which the Puritans disapproved. A single question was addressed to the bride and groom; when they freely answered in the affirmative, the event was over.18 The couple were required to register their marriage in a civil book kept by the town clerk. Then a small celebration followed—not a great feast, but a modest wedding dinner with… ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1186))
- Dancing was sternly forbidden; so also were excessive… ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1191))
- On the wedding night, the bride dressed in a special gown, and was put to bed by friends who accompanied the couple into the chamber, and then gave them a joyous charivari with much banging and bell-ringing outside the chamber. This custom was commonly kept… ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1192))
- Divorce customs also differed from other English-speaking cultures. The Puritans recognized many grounds for divorce that were consistent with their conception of marriage. The statutes of Connecticut allowed divorce for adultery, fraudulent contract, wilful desertion and total neglect for three years, and “providential absence” for seven years. Massachusetts granted… ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1196))
- Physical violence was also recognized as a ground for divorce. Husbands and wives were forbidden to strike one another in Massachusetts; there was no such thing as “moderate correction” in the laws of this colony. The courts often intervened in… ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1199))
- These various grounds for divorce also defined the idea of marriage in Massachusetts. It was to be a close and companionate relationship, a union of love and harmony, an act of sexual fulfillment, and an institution with a firm economic base. All of these requirements were part of the Puritan idea of the marriage convenant, which could be dissolved if any of its major terms… ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1202))
- Within Massachusetts marriages, conjugal relations rested upon an assumption of inequality between the sexes. This conventional idea was routinely asserted by men and… ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1207))
- This idea of gender inequality, however, was modified in important ways by the religious faith of the founders. The Puritans deeply believed that women and men were equally capable of joining the church, receiving grace and entering the kingdom of heaven. Further, many women took an active role in the Congregational churches of Massachusetts. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1215))
- The Christian ideal of spiritual equality between the sexes was specially powerful in the seventeenth century, when the fires of faith burned so brightly in the Calvinist colonies. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1219))
- The Puritans often quoted the Pauline expression that the husband was “the head of the wife.” Sermons and advice-books (all written by men) uniformly urged that a woman was duty-bound to submit to her husband, and counseled obedience and resignation in that respect. Ministers also preached that the husband ruled with God-given authority, and even represented divine sovereignty in the family. This idea was summarized in one of Milton’s mighty lines: “He for God only; She for God in Him.” ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1225))
- On the other hand, the laws of Massachusetts gave women many protections. Every woman without exception was equally entitled to the physical protection of the law. Her husband could not beat her, or even verbally abuse her—a rule that was sternly enforced. There was also an elastic clause that forbade husbands to command their wives to do anything contrary to the law of God. Further, the common law of New England recognized that women both single and married could own property, and execute contracts. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1229))
- Normally, Puritan moralists preached that husbands and wives should not have separate property. They were expected to work together for the common welfare of the family. There was no clear idea of “separate spheres” in this culture. Depositions filed in the court of Essex County, Massachusetts, during the late seventeenth century describe women routinely doing heavy field labor, carrying sacks of grain to the mill, cutting firewood, tending… ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1233))
- Custom as well as law in the Bay Colony required husbands to treat their wives not only with decency, but respect. When a man in Essex County told his spouse that “she was none of his wife, she was but a servant,” the neighbors brought a criminal complaint against him, and though the wife… ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1239))
- Puritanism was a form of social striving which labored obsessively to close the gap between ideals and actuality. Surviving letters between husbands and wives in Massachusetts commonly described a world in which both partners worked very hard at perfecting their relationship… ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1244))
- When outward signs of trouble appeared, the entire neighborhood was apt to swing into action; then the churches intervened; and finally the courts. It did not take much of a domestic disturbance to set this social machinery in motion. A sudden quarrel between husband and wife could end in a criminal indictment. The object of these proceedings was not punishment or retribution, but the restoration of good relations within the… ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1247))
- It is also important to note that these disciplinary proceedings tended to be remarkably even-handed as to the treatment of husbands and wives. A comparative study of adultery in New England and the Chesapeake finds that men and women convicted of this offense commonly received similar punishments in… ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1251))
- The Puritans also expected that important family decisions would be taken by the husband and wife together. Agreements for the sending out of children referred to both the husband’s and the wife’s consent. Business ventures were often undertaken jointly. Men and women were not equals in… ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1255))
- Between husbands and wives, the culture of New England sought to create a covenant of unequals which was cemented by a spiritual communion of love, harmony,… ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=1258))
- The Dutch in New Netherlands and the French in Quebec created extractive economies which dealt heavily in products of the forest and the sea—timber, furs, and fish. The builders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony also engaged in these activities, but mainly they constructed a different sort of economic system which reflected their East Anglian origins and Puritan purposes. ([Location 2225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2225))
- A central idea in this culture was that of “improving the time,” in the seventeenth-century sense of “turning a thing to good account.” Time-wasting in the Bay Colony was a criminal offense. ([Location 2326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2326))
- The daily rhythm of life in the Massachusetts Bay Colony was meant to make the best use of every passing moment. The New England day normally began at the crack of dawn. ([Location 2343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2343))
- Other cultures in Anglo-America showed nothing quite like this obsession with “improving the time,” which for more than three centuries became an important part of folkways in New England. ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2368))
- From the beginning, the colony of Massachusetts Bay did indeed make some New Englanders “high and eminent,” and others “mean and in subjection.” These distinctions derived from East Anglian ranking practices, but were modified in major ways by the builders of the Bay Colony. ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2568))
- Between these upper and lower ranks of East Anglian society, there were middling strata, from which came the founders of Massachusetts. This broad middle class included lesser gentry, yeomanry, prosperous farmers, artisans and tradesmen, all of whom were more numerous in the eastern counties than in other parts of England. ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2601))
- The experience of social oppression in England caused the founders of Massachusetts to modify the ranking system in their society. After much discussion, they deliberately eliminated both the top and bottom strata of the East Anglian social order, and at the same time carefully preserved its middling distinctions. The result was a social revolution which happened not as the result of some “mysterious Atlantic sea change,” as one historian has called it, or as a product of the migration process itself, or as a reflexive response to the material environment. This revolution was a conscious act which rose from religious ideals and social purposes of the founders. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2608))
- The founders of Massachusetts, unlike the rulers of other European colonies, deliberately excluded an aristocracy from their ranking system. ([Location 2630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2630))
- At the same time, the leaders of Massachusetts also made a concerted and highly successful effort to discourage immigration from the bottom of English society. They prohibited the entry of convicted felons (many of whom had been punished for crimes of poverty) and placed heavy impediments in the path of the migrant poor. ([Location 2631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2631))
- Poverty persisted in New England, but it had a different meaning from other cultures. An inhabitant of Boston in 1726 defined the poor as those who “always liv’d from hand to mouth, i.e. depended on one day’s labor to supply the wants of another.”13 The poor in this sense were remarkably few in New England—a much… ([Location 2634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2634))
- Most towns made a genuine effort to look after their own poor, as indeed they required to do by law. But for the town poor, provisions went beyond the minimum. In Salem one man was ordered “to be set by the heels in the… ([Location 2638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2638))
- Even as the founders of Massachusetts sought to eliminate extremes of rank from their society, they were very far from being egalitarian. Most Massachusetts towns deliberately preserved… ([Location 2640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2640))
- But most communities deliberately attempted to preserve the system of social ranks which had existed within the small villages of East Anglia. The King, peers, great gentry, landless laborers and wandering poor were all outsiders to those little communities. Most actual members belonged to three ranks—the lesser gentry, yeomanry and cottagers. These people lived, worked and worshipped together, in ways that were bound by… ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2642))
- Social distinctions between English gentry, yeomen and laborers were reproduced in Massachusetts, and… ([Location 2646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2646))
- John Adams wrote, “Perhaps it may be said in America we have no distinctions of ranks … but have we not laborers, yeomen, gentlemen, esquires, honorable gentlemen, and excellent gentlemen?”15 By “honorable gentlemen” and “excellent gentlemen” John Adams referred to men who were addressed as “Your Honor,” and “Your Excellency.” These titles of address also continued in Massachusetts. The gentlefolk of the Bay Colony were addressed as “Mister” and “Mistress” just as in… ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2647))
- Legal proceedings of Massachusetts, like those of England, required that every plaintiff and defendant must be identified by social order, as “gentleman,” “yeoman,” or “laborer,” or else the case could be… ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2652))

- By and large, these ranking systems were pluralistic in their definition. The seating committees of most New England towns normally used three criteria in the assignment of benches and pews—age, estate, and a third indicator that was variously called “reputation,” “place” or “usefulness.”… ([Location 2656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2656))
- In short, the ranking system of East Anglia was reproduced in Massachusetts with two decisive differences. First, the top and bottom strata were removed, and inequality persisted within a more narrow range. Second, the importance of material differences was qualified by… ([Location 2661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2661))

- The lines between masters and servants were not so sharply drawn. Servants and even slaves were always called “help,” a word that was brought… ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2667))
- Madame Sarah Knight, when traveling in New England wrote that New Englanders were much too “indulgent” to servants and even slaves, “suffering too great familiarity,… ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2669))
- Yet another component of this culture was its system of social order. In that regard, New England was characterized by a curious paradox. This was always the most orderly region in British America, but it was also very violent in its ordering acts. ([Location 2769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2769))
- For many generations, individual order coexisted with an institutional savagery that appeared in the burning of rebellious servants, the maiming of political dissenters, the hanging of Quakers, the execution of witches and the crushing to death with heavy stones of an old man who refused to plead before the court. ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2772))
- The prevailing idea of order in Puritan Massachusetts was very different from our own conceptions. It did not primarily mean “a state of peace and serenity” as Webster’s Dictionary defines it, but rather a condition where everything was put in its proper place and held there by force if necessary. Order, for the Puritans, meant a condition of organic unity—the order that “preserves the whole” in John Norton’s definition—a oneness of the spirit that did not readily admit internal differences. ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2777))
- Puritan Massachusetts turned instead to the most communitarian of English peacekeepers—the village constable. This was an ancient office, derived from the borsholders, headboroughs, boroughheads and reeves who were elected by an English township or tithing, rather than being appointed by higher authority. ([Location 2794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2794))
- New England, the constable was an officer of the town, chosen by his neighbors. His duty was to serve processes, execute warrants, deliver writs, make arrests, and summon town meetings. He could also be called upon to collect taxes, organize elections, look after lost goods, recover stray animals, keep a record of newcomers to the town and arrest “such strange persons as do walk abroad in the night ([Location 2796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2796))
- He was also required to visit and inspect all the households in the town at least once in every three months, and each year to read all the laws pertaining to the Sabbath. ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2800))
- By and large, the system worked. Violent crime and disorder were comparatively uncommon in Massachusetts. Homicide rates in seventeenth-century New England were less than half those of the Chesapeake colonies.6 Assaults against persons were also less frequent in New England than in any other part of British America.7 In the Massachusetts county courts, crimes against property were more common than crimes against persons. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2802))
- But crimes against order were the most common of all. In Massachusetts towns, most adults were prosecuted at least once for criminal offenses against order—commonly small sabbath violations, minor cases of disturbing the peace, sexual offenses, idleness, lying, domestic disorder or drunkenness. ([Location 2807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=2807))
- Many of these people came from territories that bordered the Irish Sea—the north of Ireland, the lowlands of Scotland, and the northern counties of England. Together they introduced still another variety of British culture to the New World. ([Location 8906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8906))
- after the end of Queen Anne’s War in 1713, this movement began to accelerate in a strong wavelike rhythm that continued to the outbreak of the American Revolution. Peak periods occurred in the years 1718, 1729, 1741, 1755, 1767 and 1774. Two-thirds of this traffic was concentrated in the decade from 1765 to 1775. As much as one-third of it may have occurred in the four years preceding American Independence. ([Location 8911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8911))
- At least 150,000 came from northern Ireland, sailing mostly from the ports of Belfast Lough, Londonderry, Newry, Larne and Portrush.7 Another 75,000 departed from seaports in the west of Scotland, from the Clydebank to Solway Firth.8 At least 50,000 (probably more) left from coastal towns of northern England from Maryport to Merseyside. These are conservative estimates. The true magnitude may have been much larger. ([Location 8928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8928))
- The motives of these emigrants were fundamentally unlike those of New England Puritans, Delaware Quakers and even Virginia cavaliers. Among the North Britons, there was no talk of holy experiments, or cities on a hill. These new emigrants came mainly in search of material betterment. In the early eighteenth century, many surveys of their motives found the same pattern of concern about high rents, low wages, heavy taxes and short leases. In northern Ireland, conditions were so very hard that famine and starvation were often mentioned as a leading cause of migration. ([Location 8944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8944))
- In the year 1774, four shiploads of emigrants to Nova Scotia were individually asked why they had come to America. Their answers were more positive than before, but still strongly materialist. Once again, they spoke about the rapacity of English landlords, the shortage of food, and their dreams for a better life in the New World. ([Location 8949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8949))
- When these people arrived in the New World, they faced intense prejudice from other ethnic groups. ([Location 8963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8963))
- This large flow was very mixed in its social composition. A small but important minority of Irish and North British migrants were gentry who came from the ruling order of this region. This narrow elite was destined to become eminent in American affairs. But in quantitative terms it accounted for no more than 1 or 2 percent of all emigrants. ([Location 8975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8975))
- A somewhat larger group were independent yeomen who had achieved a measure of independence from the great landlords who dominated the border region. In Cumberland and Westmorland these yeomen were called the “statesman” class. Their numbers were comparatively small throughout this area, and even smaller in the emigrant stream. ([Location 8977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8977))
- Most emigrants came from ranks below that of the gentry and statesmen. In the border counties of England and Scotland and northern Ireland as well, the majority were farmers and farm laborers who owned no land of their own, but worked as tenants and undertenants. ([Location 8980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8980))
- A large minority were semiskilled craftsmen and petty traders. In northern Ireland, many had worked in the linen trade—impoverished handloom weavers, unemployed agents, traders and entrepreneurs. This was especially the case in the period from 1772 to 1774, when the linen industry suffered a contraction of great severity. ([Location 8982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8982))
- The social origins of these emigrants were more humble than those of New England Puritans or Delaware Quakers. But they did not come from the bottom of British society. Only a minority were unskilled laborers. As always in a voluntary migration, desperately poor people were excluded by the fact of poverty itself. ([Location 8992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=8992))
- This combination of poverty and pride set the North Britons squarely apart from other English-speaking people in the American colonies. Border emigrants demanded to be treated with respect even when dressed in rags. Their humble origins did not create the spirit of subordination which others expected of “lower ranks.” This fierce and stubborn pride would be a cultural fact of high importance in the American region which they came to dominate. ([Location 9000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9000))
- The borderers of North Britain were mixed in their religious beliefs. Those who came from Scotland and the north of Ireland tended to be Presbyterian, with a scattering of Roman Catholics among them. The English border folk were mostly Anglican, with a sprinkling of small Protestant sects. ([Location 9005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9005))
- Border emigrants of the two leading denominations, Anglican and Presbyterian, both showed a strong tendency toward what was called New Light Christianity in the eighteenth century. Many Scottish and Irish Presbyterians called themselves People of the New Light before coming to America. They believed in “free grace,” and before emigrating they had formed the habit of gathering in “field meetings” and “prayer societies,” a custom which they carried to America and established in the backcountry. In Scotland, these New Light Presbyterians were specially numerous on the edges of the Irish Sea. ([Location 9006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9006))
- In Protestant Ireland, similar religious tendencies also appeared—a deep interest in reformed religion, a settled hostility to the established church, a belief in “free grace,” a habit of field meetings and a bias toward New Light Christianity. ([Location 9011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9011))
- In Scotland some were of a militant sect called “Society People” or “Cameronians.” Their founder, Richard Cameron, was a field preacher who advocated a particularly uncompromising form of covenanted Christianity. The Cameronians grew very strong in the south and west of Scotland, where they engaged in a practice called “rabbling,” or forcibly removing “unregenerate” clergy from their livings, sometimes with much violence. ([Location 9017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9017))
- The authorities hunted the Cameronians like animals across the countryside, and hanged several of their leaders. But many survived, worshipping defiantly with a Bible in one hand and a weapon in the other, and slaughtering the forces that were sent to suppress them. ([Location 9020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9020))
- After 1689, the authorities conceded defeat, and adopted the typically North British solution of recruiting these Protestant rebels to fight against Roman Catholic Jacobites in the Highlands. The result was the creation of a great fighting regiment in the British army called the Cameronians, the only regiment in the army list to bear the name of a religious leader. It appointed an Elder in every company of infantry, and required each enlisted man to carry a Bible in his kit. Even in the twentieth century this Presbyterian regiment carried arms to worship and posted sentries at the four corners of the church. It quickly became known for the ferocity of its fighting. ([Location 9022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9022))
- In 1743, the followers of Richard Cameron reorganized themselves as the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Many found their way to the American backcountry, with other North British sects. ([Location 9028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9028))
- The journal of the English missionary Charles Woodmason was a running chronicle of religious strife. When Woodmason tried to conduct an Anglican sermon in the back settlements, Presbyterians disrupted his services, rioted while he preached, started a pack of dogs fighting outside the church, loosed his horse, stole his church key, refused him food and shelter, and gave two barrels of whiskey to his congregation before a service of communion. ([Location 9035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9035))
- the border variant of the golden rule—do unto others as they threatened do unto you. ([Location 9041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9041))
- Many scholars call these people “Scotch-Irish.” That expression is an Americanism, rarely used in Britain and much resented by the people to whom it was attached. “We’re no Eerish bot Scoatch,” one of them was heard to say in Pennsylvania.15 Some preferred to be called Anglo-Irish, a label that was more commonly applied to them than Scotch-Irish during the eighteenth century. Others were called “Saxon-Scotch.” ([Location 9054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9054))
- There was no love lost between lowland and highland Scots, who differed in language, politics, religion and culture. In America, Scottish highlanders tended to settle apart in North Carolina’s Cape Fear Valley, where Gaelic continued to be spoken even into the late twentieth century. Many of these transplanted highlanders became Tories in the American Revolution, largely because their border neighbors were Whig. ([Location 9081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9081))
- “We are a mixed people,” a border immigrant declared in America during the eighteenth century. “We are a mix’d medley,” said another. So they were in many ways. They were mixed in their social rank, mixed in their religious denominations, and most profoundly mixed in their ancestry, which was Celtic, Roman, German, English, Scandinavian, Irish and Scottish in varying proportions. They were also very mixed in their place of residence—coming as they did from England, Scotland and Ireland. ([Location 9085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9085))
- No matter whether rich or poor, Anglican or Presbyterian, Saxon or Celt, they were all a border people. They shared a unique regional culture which was the product of a place in time. ([Location 9090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9090))
- This border region included six counties in the far north of England: Cumberland, Westmorland and parts of Lancashire on the western side of the Pennines; Northumberland, Durham and parts of Yorkshire to the east. It also embraced five counties of southern Scotland—Ayr, Dumfries, Wigtown, Roxburgh and Berwick. During the seventeenth century, its culture was carried westward across the Irish Sea to five counties of Ulster—Derry, Down, Armagh, Antrim and Tyrone. ([Location 9097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9097))
- The border derived its cultural character from one decisive historical fact. For seven centuries, the kings of Scotland and England could not agree who owned it, and meddled constantly in each other’s affairs. From the year 1040 to 1745, every English monarch but three suffered a Scottish invasion, or became an invader in his turn. In the same period, most Scottish kings went to war against England, and many died “with their boots on,” as the border saying went. ([Location 9115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9115))
- But in the reign of Charles I, English and Scots went to war again, and hostilities continued under the Commonwealth and Protectorate. Major raids and border risings also occurred in 1680, 1689, 1715 and 1745. Altogether, two historians of the border write that “until after 1745, the region never enjoyed fifty consecutive years of quiet.” ([Location 9145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9145))
- The cultural effect of violence was magnified by a climate of fear which continued even in periods of peace. Long after the “Forty-five,” English diaries often recorded rumors that the Scots were “over the borders.” Fear itself remained a social fact of high importance after so many centuries of strife. ([Location 9150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9150))
- Other families specialized in the theft of livestock—“rustling” was its border name. Rustling on a small scale was endemic throughout the region. ([Location 9158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9158))
- This incessant violence shaped the culture of the border region, and also created a social system which was very different from that in the south of England. On the border, forms of tenancy were designed to maintain large bodies of fighting men. ([Location 9160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9160))
- Endemic violence also had an effect upon the economy, which lagged far behind other parts of England in the pace and pattern of its development. ([Location 9166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9166))
- Border violence also made a difference in patterns of association. In a world of treachery and danger, blood relationships became highly important. Families grew into clans, and kinsmen placed fidelity to family above loyalty to the crown itself. ([Location 9178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9178))
- Borderers placed little trust in legal institutions. They formed the custom of settling their own disputes by the lex talionis of feud violence and blood money. There was also a system which the borderers called “blackmail,” involving the payment of protection money to powerful families. ([Location 9184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9184))
- endemic violence shaped the culture of this region in many other ways—in attitudes toward work, sport, time, land, wealth, rank, inheritance, marriage and gender. This culture was much the same on both sides of the border. ([Location 9186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9186))
- The pacification of this bloody region required the disruption of a culture that had been a millennium in the making. Gallows were erected on hills throughout the English border counties, and put busily to work. Thrifty Scots saved the expense of a rope by drowning their reivers instead of hanging them, sometimes ten or twenty at a time. Entire families were outlawed en masse, and some were extirpated by punitive expeditions. Many were forcibly resettled in Ireland, where officials complained that they were “as difficult to manage in Ireland as in north Cumberland,” and banished them once again—this time to the colonies. The so-called Scotch-Irish who came to America thus included a double-distilled selection of some of the most disorderly inhabitants of a deeply disordered land. ([Location 9200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9200))
- These trends also occurred in Ireland, where Calvinist colonists were caught between a rapacious Anglican elite on the one hand, and a fast-growing Catholic majority on the other. They were increasingly exploited by rack-renting landlords, bullied by county oligarchies, and taxed by a church to which they did not belong. ([Location 9219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9219))
- Many emigrants brought to America an indelible memory of oppression which shaped their political attitudes for generations to come. ([Location 9236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9236))
- As if these miseries were not enough, the people of the borders were also afflicted by famine and epidemic disease, which so often accompanied rapid change in the early modern era. A large part of the population lived close to the edge of subsistence, and became highly vulnerable to harvest fluctuations. Major crop failures occurred repeatedly in the eighteenth century—notably in the years 1727, 1740, and 1770. Each scarcity was followed by a surge of emigration. ([Location 9245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9245))
- The borderers entered America principally through the ports of Philadelphia and Newcastle. They moved quickly into the surrounding countryside, and in the words of one official, simply squatted wherever they found “a spot of vacant land.” The Quakers were not happy about this invasion. ([Location 9255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9255))
- The North Britons brought with them the ancient border habit of belligerence toward other ethnic groups. ([Location 9258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9258))
- the Quakers decided to deal with the problem in a different way, by encouraging the borderers to settle in the “back parts” of the colony. In 1731, James Logan informed the Penns in England that he was deliberately planting the North Britons in the west, “as a frontier in case of any disturbance.” Logan argued that these people might usefully become a buffer population between the Indians and the Quakers. At the same time, he frankly hoped to rid the east of them. ([Location 9265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9265))
- With much encouragement from Quaker leaders, the North Britons moved rapidly westward from Philadelphia into the rolling hills of the interior. Many drifted south and west along the mountains of Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas. They gradually became the dominant English-speaking culture in a broad belt of territory that extended from the highlands of Appalachia through much of the Old Southwest. ([Location 9269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9269))
- In the nineteenth century, they moved across the Mississippi River to Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. By the twentieth century, their influence would be felt as far west as New Mexico, Arizona and southern California. ([Location 9272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9272))
- But by far the largest concentration was to be found in the backcountry region that included southwestern Pennsylvania, the western parts of Maryland and Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee. ([Location 9275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9275))
- North Britons were 73 to 80 percent of the population in Virginia’s Augusta, Rockbridge, Fayette and Lincoln counties; 75 percent in Pennsylvania’s Washington County, 90 percent in some counties of Tennesses and Kentucky, nearly 100 percent in the Hillsboro district of North Carolina and a large majority in much of the South Carolina upcountry. These areas would become the seed settlements of the southern highlands. ([Location 9284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9284))
- Numbers alone, however, were not the full measure of their dominion. These emigrants from North Britain established in the southern highlands a cultural hegemony that was even greater than their proportion in the population.7 An explanation of this fact may be found in the character of this American environment, which proved to be exceptionally well matched to the culture of the British borderlands. ([Location 9287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9287))
- The southern backcountry was a vast area roughly the size of western Europe, extending 800 miles south from Pennsylvania to Georgia, and several hundred miles west from the Piedmont plateau to the banks of the Mississippi. The terrain consisted of corrugated ridges and valleys, rising from the coastal plain to the crest of the Appalachians (the highest point was Mt. Mitchell in North Carolina at 6,684 feet), then falling away to the western rivers. ([Location 9290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9290))
- On summer afternoons, the distant hills were masked in a shimmering haze that gave the mountains their names: Great Smoky, Blue Ridge, Purple Mountain. ([Location 9300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9300))
- The land was laced by falling waters and mountain springs that never ran dry. This abundance of water became a social fact of high importance in the back-country, for it allowed small family farms to flourish independently without the aid of any earthly power, and encouraged a sense of stubborn autonomy among the farming folk who settled there. ([Location 9304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9304))
- Before the borderers arrived, the backcountry was occupied by strong and warlike Indian nations, from the Shawnee in the north, to the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw and Chickasaw in the south. These proud people did not give way easily before white settlement. Savage warfare began in the late seventeenth century, and continued to the early nineteenth century in some of the fiercest Indian wars of American history. ([Location 9311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9311))
- Much of the southern highlands were “debateable lands” in the border sense of a contested territory without established government or the rule of law. The borderers were more at home than others in this anarchic environment, which was well suited to their family system, their warrior ethic, their farming and herding economy, their attitudes toward land and wealth and their ideas of work and power. ([Location 9315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9315))
- So well adapted was the border culture to this environment that other ethnic groups tended to copy it. The ethos of the North British borders came to dominate this “dark and bloody ground,” partly by force of numbers, but mainly because it was a means of survival in a raw and dangerous world. ([Location 9318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9318))
- The most common British county name in Appalachia was Cumberland—the extreme northwestern county in England. There was a Cumberland town in western Maryland, a Cumberland River in Tennessee, the Cumberland Mountains in Kentucky, Cumberland Knob in North Carolina, Cumberland Gap through the Appalachians, and Cumberland counties in most states throughout this region. The name had a double appeal to English borderers, for it also commemorated the Duke of Cumberland who broke their ancient highland enemies at the battle of Culloden. ([Location 9332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9332))
- Immigrants from North Britain also liked to name their settlements after individuals and clans—an uncommon practice in Puritan New England and Anglican Virginia. Many of these names also came from the borderlands. In North Carolina alone, for example, there are more than 130 place names beginning with Mc or Mac, and many Alexanders, Jacksons, Robertsons, Williamsons, and Grahams. ([Location 9346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9346))
- Not all of these backcountry settlers were people of humble origins. Some had held high rank in the Old World. Their motive in moving to America was not to rise higher in society, but to keep from falling below the status which they had already achieved. ([Location 9376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9376))
- A case in point was the family of Andrew Jackson, the first of many American Presidents to spring from border stock. Jackson’s campaign biographies have stressed the plebian origins of this popular leader. But in fact he did not come from poor or humble people. In his earliest youth, he was taught to think of himself as a gentleman. President Jackson’s Irish grandfather, Hugh Jackson, was a rich man who called himself a “weaver and merchant of Carrickfergus, Ireland, and left his American grandson a legacy later reckoned at three or four hundred pounds sterling. The future President’s immigrant father had been a well-to-do farmer who held a large property near the town of Castlereagh in northern Ireland, and led an entire party of emigrants to America in 1765. Andrew Jackson’s wife, Rachel Donelson, also came from an eminent family. Her father, Colonel John Donelson, was one of the most powerful men in the southern backcountry. She was the grandniece of Dr. Samuel Davies, a learned Presbyterian minister who became president of Princeton College. ([Location 9377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9377))
- Still other immigrants came from even higher ranks, and had belonged to a narrow elite who were known in Ireland and along the borderlands as the “Ascendancy.” These people were few in numbers among the flood of immigrants. But they quickly established a cultural hegemony in the American backcountry, and kept it for many generations. ([Location 9385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9385))
- An example of this backcountry “Ascendancy” was the Polk family. Its American progenitor was Captain Robert Polk (d. 1699), who emigrated from County Donegal, Ireland, ca. 1680. He had been highly placed in Anglo-Scots-Irish society. His wife, Magdalen Tasker Porter Polk, was the daughter of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who had lived at Bloomfield Castle near Londonderry, and inherited an Irish estate called Moneen. Robert and Magdalen Polk had seven sons. ([Location 9388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9388))
- One member of this family was the extraordinary Bishop-General Leonidas Polk, who managed to be both Episcopal bishop of Louisiana and lieutenant general in the Confederate Army. ([Location 9395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9395))
- Another descendant was a future president of the United States, James Knox Polk. ([Location 9396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9396))
- Two other Presidents, Andrew Jackson and Zachary Taylor, were related by marriage to this clan, as were many political leaders of North Carolina and Tennessee. ([Location 9396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9396))
- A third example of the backcountry Ascendancy was the Calhoun clan, which moved from Scotland to Ireland in the seventeenth century, and thence to America in 1733. ([Location 9398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9398))
- The most eminent member of this clan, John C. Calhoun, married his cousin Floride Calhoun, the daughter of John E. Calhoun (or Colhoun). ([Location 9404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9404))
- From the start the Calhouns were people of substance. The family patriarch Patrick Calhoun was called “squire” even before he settled in South Carolina. As early as the mid-eighteenth century, the four Calhoun brothers owned thousands of acres, and rapidly acquired large numbers of slaves as well. They also held many high offices. Four of them represented South Carolina in the federal Congress before 1815. ([Location 9409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9409))
- Yet another example was the Henry family. Its progenitor was an Anglo-Scottish gentleman named John Henry, who emigrated about the year 1730. He was related to leading families on both sides of the border. Among his cousins was David Henry, publisher of Gentleman’s Magazine, and on his mother’s side he was connected to William Robertson, the historian who became principal of Edinburgh University. Yet another cousin was Eleanor Syme, a famous Edinburgh beauty who married Henry Brougham of Brougham Hall in Westmorland and raised one of England’s great political families. ([Location 9411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9411))
- A little later, Mistress Syme married John Henry, and in 1736 became the mother of Patrick Henry. That great revolutionist liked to appear as a tribune of the people, but by birth he was a high-born backcountry gentleman with connections to the English border gentry. Patrick Henry was the cousin of the great English Whig Lord Brougham of Brougham Hall, Westmorland. ([Location 9429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9429))
- Yet another example of the backcountry ascendancy was John Houston, who arrived in America with his wife and six children in 1730. He signed himself “John Houston, Gent.,” and was of a family of border baronets. He did not come penniless to the New World. According to family legend he arrived with a small keg of gold sovereigns. In passage to America, a rapacious captain and crew discovered the wealth of their passenger, and made the fatal mistake trying to steal it. John Houston promptly organized the passengers, seized the ship, and sailed it himself to America. In the backcountry, he instantly assumed the station of county justice and acquired vast holdings of rich land in the Valley of Virginia. At the age of sixty-five, he was killed by a falling tree. One of his descendants was Sam Houston, the future governor of Tennessee and president of Texas. ([Location 9432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9432))
- Other elite groups in the backcountry included three of the most prominent raiding, reiving and rustling families on England’s northwestern frontier: the Grahams, Bells and Bank-heads. All were expelled from England and forcibly resettled in Ireland. Many members of these clans came to America, and joined the elite of the southern highlands. ([Location 9439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9439))
- The Bankheads became specially eminent in Alabama—producing leaders in many fields, including U.S. Senator John Bankhead, his brother William Bankhead, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Speaker’s actress daughter Tallulah Bankhead. Even to our own time, Bankheads occupy many positions of eminence throughout the southern highlands. ([Location 9441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9441))
- Also present in even greater number were the Grahams and Bells, two of the earliest border clans to settle in western North Carolina. They held many high offices, and gave their name to counties and towns throughout the southern highlands. ([Location 9444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9444))
- The Calhouns, Polks, Jacksons, Henrys, Houstons, Bells, Grahams and Bankheads were typical of the backcountry elite. The founders of these families in America had all been people of substance in North Britain. They tended to emigrate during the early eighteenth century. Some came a generation earlier or later, but most arrived in the backcountry during the 1730s. They moved quickly to the top of backcountry society, and preserved their eminence for many generations. ([Location 9445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9445))
- These border families, no matter whether English, Scots, Scots-Irish, Anglo-Irish or even Anglo-Welsh, shared many values and beliefs in common. They intermarried among themselves, and rapidly became an integrated elite throughout the southern highlands. For two centuries the public life of this region has been dominated by names that first appeared in the backcountry during the middle decades of the eighteen century. ([Location 9456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9456))
- The archetypical backcountry leader was Andrew Jackson, the son of Scots-Irish immigrants who became the seventh President of the United States. Historians and social scientists have suggested many ways of making sense of this man and his movement. To study him in the context of his time and place is to discover that he was the carrier of a special folk culture which was brought from the borders of North Britain to the American backcountry. ([Location 9460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9460))
- The people of the southern highlands would become famous in the nineteenth century for the intensity of their xenophobia, and also for the violence of its expression. In the early nineteenth century, they tended to detest great planters and abolitionists in equal measure. ([Location 9481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9481))
- In the early twentieth century they would become intensely negrophobic and antisemitic. In our own time they are furiously hostile to both communists and capitalists. The people of the southern highlands have been remarkably even-handed in their antipathies—which they have applied to all strangers without regard to race, religion or nationality. ([Location 9483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9483))
- Behind these attitudes lay the same deep feelings of cultural anxiety and insecurity that had existed in most other colonial societies. These emotions were specially intense among the first generation. They reached their climax in the violent movement called the Regulation, which swept through the back settlements of North and South Carolina from 1765 to 1771. In both colonies, the Regulators were backcountry vigilantes who sought to impose order by force upon their region, and also attacked outsiders. ([Location 9486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9486))
- Another symptom of this attitude was a strong mood of cultural conservatism. From the seventeenth century to the twentieth, travelers in the backcountry often remarked upon the intensity of its attachment to ancestral ways. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason wrote in disgust, “They delight in their present low, lazy, sluttish, heathenish, hellish life, and seem not desirous of changing it.”4 That statement, without its pejoratives, described an instinctive conservatism which was also noted by other travelers and acknowledged by the backsettlers themselves. “We never let go of a belief once fixed in our minds,” wrote an Appalachian woman with an air of pride.5 ([Location 9491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9491))
- This mood caused the backsettlers to cling tenaciously to the customs that they had carried from the borderlands of North Britain. The result was a complex process of continuity and change, similar in its form to that which occurred in other cultural regions of the New World, but different in its substance. ([Location 9496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9496))
- The earliest recorded examples of this “Scotch-Irish” speech were strikingly similar to the language that is spoken today in the southern highlands, and has become familiar throughout the western world as the English of country western singers, transcontinental truckdrivers, cinematic cowboys, and backcountry politicians. ([Location 9507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9507))
- Sexual processes and natural functions were freely used in figurative expressions. Small children, for example, were fondly called “little shits” as a term of endearment. A backcountry granny would say kindly to a little child, “Ain’t you a cute little shit.” ([Location 9528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9528))
- Sexual terms also frequently appeared in backcountry place names, before the Victorians erased them from the maps of this region. In Lunenberg County, Virginia, two small streams were named Tickle Cunt Branch and Fucking Creek. ([Location 9530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9530))
- Every vocabulary word which we have noted as typical of American backcountry speech also appears in word lists collected in the English border counties of Cumberland and Westmorland during the nineteenth century. ([Location 9535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9535))
- The family ways of the backcountry, like its speech and building ways, were also brought from the borderlands of North Britain and adapted to a new American environment with comparatively little change. “The conquest of the back parts,” writes Carl Bridenbaugh, “was achieved by families. … The fundamental social unit, the family, was preserved intact … in a transplanting and reshuffling of European folkways.”1 ([Location 9651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9651))
- From the perspective of an individual within this culture, the structure of the family tended to be a set of concentric rings, in which the outermost circles were thicker and stronger than among other English-speaking people. ([Location 9655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9655))
- Beyond the nuclear core, beyond even the extended circle, there were two rings which were unique to this culture. One was called the derbfine. It encompassed all kin within the span of four generations. For many centuries, the laws of North Britain and Ireland had recognized the derbfine as a unit which defined the descent of property and power. It not only connected one nuclear family to another, but also joined one generation to the next. ([Location 9657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9657))
- Beyond the derbfine lay a larger ring of kinship which was called the clan in North Britain. We think of clans today mainly in connection with the Scottish Highlands. But they also existed in the lowlands, northern Ireland and England’s border counties where they were a highly effective adaptation to a world of violence and chronic insecurity. ([Location 9660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9660))
- The clans of the border were not precisely the same as those of the Scottish Highlands, and very different from the Victorian contrivances of our own time. They had no formal councils, tartans, sporrans, bonnets or septs. But they were clannish in the most fundamental sense: a group of related families who lived near to one another, were conscious of a common identity, carried the same surname, claimed descent from common ancestors and banded together when danger threatened. ([Location 9662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9662))
- The Armstrongs, one of the largest clans on the Cumbrian border in the sixteenth century, were reputed to be able to field 3,000 mounted men, and were much feared by their neighbors. The Grahams held thirteen towers on the western border in 1552, and bid defiance to their foes. The Rutherfords and Halls were so violent that royal officials in 1598 ordered no quarter to be given to anyone of those names. ([Location 9666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9666))
- The Johnston-Johnson clan adorned their houses with the flayed skins of their enemies the Maxwells in a blood feud that continued for many generations. ([Location 9668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9668))
- These North British border clans tended to settle together in the American backcountry. An example was the Alexander clan. In North Carolina’s Catawba County, the first United States Census of 1790 listed 300 nuclear families named Alexander. Most were blood relations. ([Location 9682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9682))
- These concentrations of kinsmen, all bearing the same surname, created endless onomastic confusion. We are told that in Catawba County, “so numerous were the tribe of the Alexanders that they had to be designated by their office, their trade or their middle name.” The most eminent Alexander was called “Governor Nat” to distinguish him from “Red Head Nat” and “Fuller Nat.” This became a common custom throughout the southern highlands. ([Location 9685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9685))
- The clan system spread rapidly throughout the southern highlands, and gradually came to include English and German settlers as well as North Britons, because it worked so well in the new environment. ([Location 9689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9689))
- The internal structure of the clan was not what some modern observers have imagined. Historian Ned Landsman writes, “ … among the distinctive features of clan organization was the emphasis on collateral rather than lineal descent. In the theory of clan relationships, all branches of the family—younger as well as older, female as well as male—were deemed to be of equal importance. This fit in well with the mobility of the countryside, which prevented the formation of ‘lineal families’ in which sons succeeded to their fathers’ lands.” ([Location 9694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9694))
- Admission by marriage was a process of high complexity. “When a Scottish man or woman took a spouse who was not of Scottish descent,” Landsman writes, “the whole family could be absorbed into the ‘Scottish’ community.”7 But when the bride had belonged to a rival clan, then the question of loyalty became more difficult. Generally a new bride left her own kin, and joined those of her husband. ([Location 9698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9698))
- Elaborate customs regulated the relationship between the wife and the family she had joined by marriage. These customs were highly complex, but by and large they established the principle that marriage ties were weaker than blood ties. ([Location 9702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9702))
- In many cases the husband and wife both came from the same clan. In the Cumbrian parish of Hawkshead, for example, both the bride and groom bore the same last names in 25 percent of all marriages from 1568 to 1704. Marriages in the backcountry, like those on the borders, also occurred very frequently between kin. ([Location 9705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9705))
- Within these family networks, nuclear households were highly cohesive, drawing strength from the support of other kin groups round about them. Landsman writes: “The patterned dispersal of the Scots, rather than isolating individual settlers from their homes and families, served instead to bind together the scattered settlements through a system of interlocking family networks. Rather than a deterrent, mobility was an essential component of community life.” ([Location 9707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9707))
- The clan was not an alternative to the nuclear family, but its nursery and strong support. The pattern of cohesion was different from the nuclear families of Puritans and Quakers which had exceptionally strong internal bonds, powerfully reinforced by ethical and religious teachings. Among the North Britons the clan system provided an external source of cohesion—supporting each nuclear family from the outside like a system of external buttresses. ([Location 9712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9712))
- Nuclear households were large in the backcountry—among the largest in British America during the eighteenth century. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason wrote with his usual mixture of fact and prejudice, “ … there’s not a cabin but has ten or twelve young people in it … in many cabins you will see ten or fifteen children—children and grand children of one size—and the mother looking as young as the daughter.”11 ([Location 9715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9715))
- North Carolina’s governor Arthur Dobbs, who had served as surveyor general of Ireland, took his own informal census of household size in the backcountry, and found that of thirty households on Rocky River, near the boundary of North and South Carolina, there were “not less than from five or six to ten children in each family.”12 ([Location 9719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9719))
- In the first comprehensive census of the backcountry, taken in 1800, fertility ratios in the southern highlands were 40 percent higher than in the Delaware Valley, and higher also than on the northern frontier. An unusually large proportion of backcountry households were intact, with both husband and wife present. Many were also joint households, with more than one nuclear family living under the same roof. ([Location 9722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9722))
- As late as 1850 one-third of all households in the southern highlands included members who were not of the primary nuclear group.13 ([Location 9725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9725))
- There was no “emergence of the modern nuclear family” in this region, through its first two hundred years. The very opposite was the case. As time passed, clans became stronger rather than weaker in the southern highlands. ([Location 9726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9726))
- These clans fostered an exceptionally strong sense of loyalty, which a modern sociologist has called “amoral familism,” from the ethical perspective of his own historical moment.15 In its own time and place, it was not amoral at all, but a moral order of another kind, which recognized a special sense of obligation to kin. That imperative was a way of dealing with a world where violence and disorder were endemic. Long after it had lost its reason for being, family loyalty retained its power in the American backcountry. ([Location 9736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9736))
- An example was the persistence of the family feud, which continued for many centuries in the southern highlands. These feuds flowed from the fact that families in the borderlands and back-country were given moral properties which belonged mainly to individuals in other English-speaking cultures. Chief among them were the attributes of honor and shame. When one man forfeited honor in the backcountry, the entire clan was diminished by his loss. When one woman was seduced and abandoned, all her “menfolk” shared the humiliation. The feuds of the border and the backcountry rose mainly from this fact. ([Location 9740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9740))
- Marriage customs among the people of the backcountry also derived from border roots. An ancient practice on the British borders was the abduction of brides. In Scotland, Ireland and the English border counties, the old custom had been elaborately regulated through many centuries by ancient folk laws which required payment of “body price” and “honor price.” Two types of abduction were recognized: voluntary abduction in which the bride went willingly but without her family’s prior consent; and involuntary abduction in which she was taken by force. ([Location 9756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9756))
- Even future President of the United States Andrew Jackson took his wife by an act of voluntary abduction. Rachel Donelson Robards was unhappily married to another man at the time. A series of complex quarrels followed, in which Rachel Robards made her own preferences clear, and Andrew Jackson threatened her husband Lewis Robards that he would “cut his ears out of his head.” Jackson was promptly arrested. But before the case came to trial the suitor turned on the husband, butcher knife in hand, and chased him into the canebreak. Afterward, the complaint was dismissed because of the absence of the plaintiff—who was in fact running for his life from the defendant. Andrew Jackson thereupon took Rachel Robards for his own, claiming that she had been abandoned. She went with Jackson willingly enough; this was a clear case of voluntary abduction. But her departure caused a feud that continued for years. ([Location 9765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9765))
- For a cultural historian, the responses to this event were more important than the act itself. In later years, Jackson’s methods of courtship became a campaign issue, and caused moral outrage in other parts of the republic; but in the backcountry he was not condemned at the time. Historian Robert Remini writes, “One thing is certain. Whatever Rachel and Andrew did, and whenever they did it, their actions did not outrage the community.” ([Location 9771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9771))
- The distinctiveness of this system also appeared in quantitative indicators. Age at marriage in the backcountry was different from every other American region. Both brides and grooms were very young. South Carolinian David Ramsay wrote of the backcountry, “ … marriages are early and generally prolific. In one district, containing upwards of 17,000 white inhabitants, there is not one woman at the age of twenty-five who is neither wife or widow.” ([Location 9847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9847))
- Historian Mark Kaplanoff finds that in three districts of upcountry South Carolina during the eighteenth century, women married at the average age of nineteen; men at twenty-one. In no other region of British America did both sexes marry so early. Nowhere else were the ages of males and females so nearly the same. ([Location 9851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9851))
- it is interesting to observe that of all the regions of England, age at marriage was lowest in the north—as much as three years below southern England. Here again, the backsettlers followed their ancestral ways. ([Location 9854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9854))
- Here was the basis of gender relationships in the backcountry. The first principle was that men were warriors. The second was that women were workers. These ideas had long flourished on the borders of north Britain. When they were combined with the ethics of Christianity, the result was a gender system of high complexity which might best be described as a bundle of paradoxes. ([Location 9864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9864))
- One paradox concerned gender distinctions. In the backcountry, work roles were not as sharply divided by sex as in other English cultures. But at the same time, the people of the back-country had exceptionally clear-cut ideas of masculinity and feminity in manners, speech, dress, decorum and status. ([Location 9867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9867))
- Travelers in the backcountry often reported that women and men routinely shared the heaviest manual labor. Both sexes worked together in the fields, not merely at harvest time but through the entire growing season. Women not only tended the livestock but also did the slaughtering of even the largest animals. Travelers were startled to observe delicate females knock down beef cattle with a felling ax, and then roll down their sleeves, remove their bloody aprons, tidy their hair, and invite their visitors to tea. Females also helped with the heavy labor of forest-clearing and ground-breaking. ([Location 9870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9870))
- Those customs have sometimes been explained as a response to the frontier environment. But they did not exist in quite the same way on the Puritan frontier, and the same patterns had long been observed by travelers in the borderlands of North Britain. ([Location 9876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9876))
- In other respects, there was very little equality between husbands and wives in the British borderlands or the American back-country. The historical myth that the frontier created a spirit of equality among the sexes could not be farther from the truth. Backcountry families were decidedly male-dominant—much more so than in New England or the Delaware Valley. ([Location 9882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9882))
- The male was expected to be the head of the household; his consort was required to do his bidding quietly, cheerfully and without complaint. This was a traditional folkway among the border people. ([Location 9884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9884))
- Love and violence together were common ingredients of back-country marriages—both expressed with an emotional intensity that rarely appeared in Massachusetts or the Delaware. ([Location 9913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9913))
- Gender relations in the backcountry, like those of the borderlands, combined elements which have often coexisted in warrior cultures—clear-cut ideas of men as fighters and women as workers; exceptionally sharp distinctions between masculine and feminine roles; extreme male domination and female dependence within the family; intense expressions of love and violence between wives and husbands; and sometimes a great aching silent distance that kept them apart. ([Location 9928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9928))
- Whenever a culture exists for many generations in conditions of chronic insecurity, it develops an ethic that exalts war above work, force above reason, and men above women. This pattern developed on the borders of North Britain, and was carried to the American backcountry, where it was reinforced by a hostile environment and tempered by evangelical Christianity. The result was a distinctive system of gender roles that continues to flourish even in our own time. ([Location 9933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9933))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- On the subject of sex, the backsettlers tended to be more open than were other cultures of British America. Sexual talk was free and easy in the backcountry—more so than in Puritan Massachusetts or Quaker Pennsylvania, or even Anglican Virginia. So too was sexual behavior. ([Location 9937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9937))
- Rates of prenuptial pregnancy were very high in the backcountry—higher than other parts of the American colonies. In the year 1767, Woodmason calculated that 94 percent of backcountry brides whom he had married in the past year were pregnant on their wedding day, and some were “very big” with child. ([Location 9953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9953))
- Another factor was a scarcity of clergy to perform marriages in the backcountry. But there was also a different explanation. Rates of illegitimacy and prenuptial pregnancy had long been higher in the far northwest of England than in any other part of that nation. The magnitude of regional differences was very great. ([Location 9962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9962))
- Rates of bastardy in the northwest were three times higher than in the east of England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Regional disparities persisted from the beginning of parish registers to the twentieth century. ([Location 9964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9964))
- High rates of illegitimacy and prenuptial pregnancy in the backcountry were not the necessary consequences of frontier conditions. Puritans also moved onto new lands in the northern colonies and continued to behave in puritanical ways. The same continuities appeared among the Quakers when they moved to the frontier. The sexual customs of the southern backcountry were similar to those of northwestern England. ([Location 9967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9967))
- When prenuptial pregnancy occurred, customary responses in the backcountry differed from other regions. Where Puritans, Quakers and cavaliers launched formal prosecutions for fornication, the back settlers had a merry game and a good laugh. ([Location 9970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9970))
- Another sort of sexual deviance was very rare in the backcountry. There were not many cases of seduction and abandonment, which was regarded not merely as a violation of a woman’s virtue but of her entire family’s honor. Such an act was thought to be a high crime, and any man who committed it was lucky to escape a lynching. ([Location 9974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9974))
- Here was an earthy and unrestrained celebration of animal sexuality that was distinctly different from the ways of Puritans, Quakers and even cavaliers. Once again we find another strong similarity between the British borderlands and the American backcountry. ([Location 9987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9987))
- Favored forenames in the backcountry included a mixture of biblical names (John was the top choice), Teutonic names (such as Robert or Richard), and the names of border saints (especially Andrew, Patrick, David). This combination did not exist in any other English-speaking culture. ([Location 9991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9991))
- Patricks were uncommon in Anglican Virginia and nearly unknown in Puritan New England. Harvard College did not admit a single undergraduate named Patrick in all the years from 1636 to 1820. But in Cumberland Country, Pennsylvania, Patrick was the fourth most popular name on military muster rolls during the eighteenth century. ([Location 9998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=9998))
- After the baby was born, parents began the process which the modern world calls socialization. For backcountry boys, the object was not will-breaking as among the Puritans, or will-bending as in Virginia. The rearing of male children in the back settlements was meant to be positively will-enhancing. Its primary purpose was to foster fierce pride, stubborn independence and a warrior’s courage in the young. An unintended effect was to create a society of autonomous individuals who were unable to endure external control and incapable of restraining their rage against anyone who stood in their way. ([Location 10046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10046))
- A case in point was the childhood of young Andrew Jackson, the future seventh President of the United States. Important parts of his socialization in this oral culture were the stories that his mother told him. They were old border tales that celebrated courage, pride and independence. The games of his youth were contests for dominion—wrestling, running and fighting. ([Location 10050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10050))
- As a young militiaman, he was described as “bold, dashing, fearless and mad upon his enemies.” That style of behavior was widely admired in the backcountry, where small boys were routinely taught to conduct themselves in the same way. ([Location 10056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10056))
- This system of child rearing began by being highly indulgent and permissive. In both the British borderlands and the American backcountry, parents doted upon male children, with an intensity of feeling that startled observers. ([Location 10058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10058))
- At an early age, male children were given their own miniature weapons—an axe, a knife, a bow, even a childish gun. ([Location 10074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10074))
- This method of child rearing was used mainly for boys. The daughters of the backcountry were raised in a different way. Mothers were expected to teach domestic virtues of industry, obedience, patience, sacrifice and devotion to others. Male children were taught to be self-asserting; female children were trained to be self-denying. ([Location 10093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10093))
- These backcountry child ways were not the product of slavery or the frontier. They were transplanted from the borders of North Britain, where they were yet another cultural adaptation to the endemic violence of that region. They were also similar to systems of socialization which have existed in warrior castes throughout the world. ([Location 10096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10096))
- This system of child rearing flourished in its new American environment. This backcountry held a different set of dangers, but they operated in the same way. Indians, bandits, regulators, weak governments and wars all combined to reinforce the warrior ethic of the backsettlers. That ethic in turn promoted a system of child rearing which was designed to make boys into warriors and girls into their consorts and helpmeets. ([Location 10098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10098))
- Similar attitudes of respect for age often appeared in the Presbyterian churches of Appalachia. Congregations were normally seated by age, and the oldest were given the best and most comfortable places. ([Location 10110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10110))
- In North Britain, from time immemorial, the rule of tanistry (or thanistry, as in thane) had long determined the descent of authority within a clan. It held that “succession to an estate or dignity was conferred by election upon the ‘eldest and worthiest’ among the surviving kinsmen.”8 Candidates for this honor were males within the circle of kin called the derbfine—all the relatives within the span of four generations. By the rule of tanistry, one man among that group was chosen to head the family: he who was strongest, toughest and most cunning. ([Location 10156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10156))
- This principle became an invitation to violent conflict, and the question was often settled by a trial of strength and cunning. The winner became the elder of his family or clan, and was honored with deference and deep respect. The losers were degraded and despised—if they were lucky. In ancient days they were sometimes murdered, blinded or maimed. ([Location 10161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10161))
- By the rule of tanistry, families, clans and even kingdoms gained strong leaders who were able to protect them. ([Location 10168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10168))
- The principle of tanistry operated in North Britain on two levels. It was used in a formal way to settle the descent of high office—in Scotland, even the monarchy. At the same time it also existed as a broad principle of eldership which sorted the old into two categories—the strong who were respected and honored; and the weak who were degraded and despised. ([Location 10169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10169))
- These border and backcountry age ways differed from the customs of other regions in British America, and also from attitudes in our own time. But they were not unique. Similar patterns have also appeared in many human cultures which survive precariously on the edge of insecurity. ([Location 10181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10181))
- That curious experience expressed a central paradox in back-country Christianity—its intense hostility to organized churches and established clergy on the one hand, and its abiding interest in religion on the other. This version of militant Christianity did not fit well with the plans of Britain’s imperial authorities, who intended that the backcountry should become an Anglican garden. ([Location 10312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10312))
- Even members of the Church of England behaved like dissenters in the backcountry, as they had often done in the north of England. On both sides of the British border there had been a strong antipathy to state churches, religious taxes and established clergy. ([Location 10326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10326))
- Throughout the backcountry and borderlands, Anglican priests were held in special contempt for their lack of personal piety, and for their habit of subservience to landed elites. ([Location 10329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10329))
- In the back-country, before the end of the eighteenth century, a familiar form of evangelical religion was the camp meeting. This was an outdoor gathering, commonly convened in some sylvan setting, where a large number of people worshiped together for several days. Many historians have mistakenly believed that the camp meeting was invented on the American frontier. In fact it was transplanted to America from the border counties of Britain, where it was well established by the eighteenth century. Even the Anglican population of that region often met in outdoor “field meetings” during the eighteenth century. So also did Scottish Presbyterians who held frequent “Holy Fairs,” which were camp meetings by another name. ([Location 10342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10342))
- The Methodist itinerant Francis Asbury preached at many such meetings in the 1780s—500 people at Bayside Chapel, on Maryland’s eastern shore (1783); 400 gathered round a great sycamore in western Virginia (1784); 1,000 in an urban meeting at Baltimore (1785).12 Most were held for two days. These assemblies began with prayer and preaching, reached their climax in what was called a “great shout,” and ended in a Christian “love feast.” ([Location 10372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10372))
- for many it was a profoundly moving experience, and also came to be practiced by Methodists and Baptists and many small sects. It has remained part of the religious folkways of the southern highlands for two centuries. Here were the major ingredients of backcountry religion: the camp meeting, the Christian fellowship, the love feast, the evangelical preacher, the theology of Protestant fundamentalism and born-again revivalism. All of them had appeared in that region by the mid-eighteenth century. Altogether, this form of reformed religion—intensely emotional, evangelical and personal—was a central part of backcountry culture. ([Location 10385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10385))
- The people of the back-country brought with them the magic that existed on the borders of North Britain in the early and middle decades of the eighteenth century. These beliefs included an interest in witchcraft, wizardry and other forms of diabolical magic—but not the same sort of witchcraft obsession that had flourished among the Puritans a century earlier. ([Location 10407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10407))
- The folk culture of the backcountry ran strongly to another category of magic, which might be called experimental sorcery or secular superstition. It consisted mainly in the pragmatic use of conjuring, sorcery, charms, omens, spells, potions, incantations and popular astrology to change the course of events, or to predict them.4 This magic contained a vast repertory of practices for any imaginable occasion—for troubles with animals, crops, neighbors, children, weather, illness. It recommended actions for the control of any possible emotion, and for the execution of any imaginable purpose in the world. ([Location 10446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10446))
- Several studies have found that German Protestant and French Huguenot settlers were the most literate: more than 90 percent could write their names. Scottish highlanders were the least so among the free population; ([Location 10550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10550))
- On both sides of the border, the proportion of male tenants and craftsmen who signed by mark was in the range of 20 to 30 percent—almost exactly the same as in the backcountry. This was the lower-middling class that produced the majority of emigrants to America. ([Location 10557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10557))
- Variations by social rank were very great in the borderlands, as they would be in the backcountry. Nearly all the gentry were literate as early as the seventeenth century. But less than 15 percent of laborers could write their names in the lowlands of Scotland and in the north of England as late as 1770. These differences also were carried to America. ([Location 10560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10560))
- These patterns must be seen in perspective. By comparison with other parts of the world, the backcountry was not illiterate. At a time when 20 to 30 percent of males in the southern highlands were unable to read and write, the proportion of illiteracy in Italy and Spain was 70 to 80 percent. ([Location 10573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10573))
- Even so, the backcountry was an oral culture in which writing was less imporant than the spoken word. The backsettlers maintained an attitude of cultivated contempt for orthography. ([Location 10575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10575))
- This culture was impoverished in its written literature, but it was rich in ballads and folktales which were carefully handed down from one generation to the next. Samuel Kercheval remembered that a favorite entertainment of the backsettlers during the eighteenth century was the singing of old folksongs. ([Location 10580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10580))
- The importance of oral communication in the backcountry created a special form of knowing, in which testimony had a peculiar importance. The power of testimony, in turn, gave a special importance to truth-telling, which was defined in the biblical sense as not bearing false witness—an idea different from other cultures. ([Location 10611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10611))
- An oral culture placed an exceptionally high value on speaking the truth. The penalty for lying or breaking one’s “word of honor” was ostracism from the society, and even from one’s kin. ([Location 10620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10620))
- The oral culture of the backcountry had an epistemic structure that set it apart from other Anglo-American folkways. It gave great importance to experience, memory, testimony and truth-telling. It also showed an actual antipathy to fixed schemes of grammar, orthography and punctuation. Here again the four folkways of early America did not merely know different things. They also knew them differently. ([Location 10634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10634))
- Backcountry education occurred mostly in small “neighborhood schools” maintained by private subscription and taught by itinerant masters for a few weeks each year. These humble institutions were similar to schools in the British borderlands where masters were hired ad hoc by local gentry. ([Location 10665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10665))
- To this general rule of educational poverty in the back settlements, there was an important exception in the growth of Presbyterian academies. These institutions were modeled on dissenting academies in Ireland and North Britain during the seventeenth century. Their primary purpose was to prepare candidates for the ministry. ([Location 10671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10671))
- This was, as we shall see, a very special conception of liberty, far removed from the ordered liberty of the Puritans, the reciprocal liberty of the Quakers and the hierarchical liberty of the cavaliers. It was an act deeply rooted in backcountry culture. ([Location 10710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10710))
- Another important foodstuff in the borderlands and the back settlements was the potato. This American vegetable had been widely introduced to western Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and became especially popular in Ireland, Scotland and the north of England. Despite its American origins, the potato had been uncommon in the English colonies until the North Britons arrived during the eighteenth century, and made it an important part of backcountry ([Location 10741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10741))
- Yet another staple was a family of breadstuffs variously called “clapbread,” “haverbread,” “hearth bread,” “griddle cakes,” and “pancakes.” Sometimes they were also called scones, after an old Norse word for crust. ([Location 10745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10745))
- In other respects, backcountry food ways necessarily departed from the customs of North Britain. Oats yielded to maize, which was pounded into cornmeal and cooked by boiling. But this was merely a change from oatmeal mush to cornmeal mush, or “grits” as it was called in the southern highlands. The ingredients changed, but the texture of the dish remained the same. ([Location 10750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10750))
- Pork rapidly replaced mutton on backcountry tables, but it continued to be boiled and fried in traditional border ways. ([Location 10755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10755))
- The distinctive backcountry beverage was whiskey. A taste for liquor distilled from grain was uncommon in the south and east of England. But it was highly developed in north Britain, and was brought to the American backcountry by the people of that region. ([Location 10760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10760))
- A change of ingredients was made necessary by the new environment. In the back settlements Scotch whiskey (which had been distilled from barley) yielded to Bourbon whiskey (which was made mainly from corn and rye). ([Location 10764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10764))
- Whiskey became a common table drink in the backcountry. Even little children were served whiskey at table, with a little sugar to sweeten its bitter taste. ([Location 10766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10766))
- One visitor was astonished when his hostess proceeded to wash her feet in the cookpot. Another was given the tablecloth for a bedsheet. The folklore of that region actively discouraged cleanliness. To wash a milk churn was thought to be unlucky. Frogs were dropped into the milk to make it thicken. The quality of butter was believed to be improved in proportion to the number of human hairs embedded in it. ([Location 10782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10782))
- They tended to take only two meals a day—a plain breakfast and a hearty meal in mid-afternoon. “These people eat twice a day only,” Woodmason declared, and complained that he was unable to find a proper English breakfast, lunch and dinner. The rhythm of two daily meals was a North British custom, carried to the interior of America by the border people. ([Location 10786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10786))
- Men, women and even children tended to adorn themselves in a manner that seemed fundamentally alien to other English-speaking people. Backcountry women dressed in what Anglican clergyman Charles Woodmason called “shift and petticoat,” which were its nearest equivalents in the south of England. But in fact it was a different style of clothing altogether—a full bodice with deep décolletage, tight-fitted waist, short full skirt and a hem worn high above the ankle. The Anglican missionary thought it scandalously revealing. ([Location 10801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10801))
- Married women covered themselves more modestly in long dresses, with heavy woolen shawls draped across their head and shoulders. ([Location 10805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10805))
- These dresses were not shut away in closets but draped upon the cabin walls as a form of decoration. ([Location 10811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10811))
- Male backsettlers also had a style of dress that startled strangers. They commonly wore shirts of linen in the summer and deerskin in the wintertime. ([Location 10815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10815))
- The men of the backcountry also wore loose, flowing trousers or breeches or “drawers” as Kercheval called them. The lower legs were sometimes sheathed in gaiters called “leather stockings,” ([Location 10826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10826))
- Later generations remembered this backcountry costume as aboriginally American—the pioneer dress of the frontier. But it was not worn on most frontiers, and was not invented in America. It was similar to dress ways described by travelers in the north of England, the lowlands of Scotland and northern Ireland. This male costume in the British border country was very similar to that which would be worn in the American backcountry—the same linsey or leather shirts, the same broad cut across the shoulders and chest, the same horizontal seams, the same heavy stress on masculinity, the same “drawers” and trowsers, the same leather stockings. Leather shirts and leggings were not frontier inventions. They were commonly worn throughout the borders in the eighteenth century. ([Location 10835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10835))
- These various dress ways spread through the southern highlands and onto the southwestern frontier. Many elements survive to this day, in the clothing style that is called “western dress” in the United States. Derivative forms also appear in the stage costumes of country-western singers, and in the wardrobes of back-country presidents such as Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. They may still be seen in the ordinary dress of men and women throughout a broad region from Nashville to Dallas. ([Location 10853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=10853))
- In the southern highlands, many different sovereignties created a chaos of conflicting claims that “overlapped like shingles on a roof,” as one historian has written. Small tracts of land were given out on a headright or bounty system. Individual patents of a few hundred acres that were sold for small sums.2 At the same time, huge tracts were granted to a few great landowners with connections in London and colonial capitals. ([Location 11067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11067))
- A majority of adult males in the southern highlands owned no land at all. The result was a system of landholding characterized by a large landless underclass of tenants and squatters, a middle class that was small by comparison with other colonies, and a few very rich landlords. ([Location 11070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11070))
- One county alone (of thirteen) was sixty miles square; another measured 60 by 150 miles. Altogether, Granville District encompassed approximately twenty million acres—and all of it was the property of one Englishman. Granville was able to defend his title, and by the 1760s he was collecting rents from backsettlers who had moved upon his land. ([Location 11078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11078))
- There was a class of small landowners in the backcountry who have been called the southern yeomanry. Their numbers were relatively smaller than in New England or the middle colonies. At the same time, large numbers of backsettlers owned no land at all, but merely squatted on the lands of others. ([Location 11081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11081))
- Many remained poor and landless for generations. This pattern of land distribution—a few large absentee owners, a small class of yeomanry, and many landless families, was characteristic of the southern highlands. ([Location 11083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11083))
- One of the most stubborn myths of American history is the idea that the frontier promoted equality of material condition. This national folk legend is, unhappily, very much mistaken. With some exceptions, landed wealth was always highly concentrated throughout the southern highlands, as it would be in the lower Mississippi Valley, Texas and the far southwest. Inequality was greater in the backcountry and the southern highlands than in any other rural region of the United States. ([Location 11085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11085))
- In this respect, as in so many others, the southern backcountry resembled the borderlands of North Britain. Every region of Great Britain has been marked by deep and pervasive inequalities. But some regions have been more unequal than others, and among the most inegalitarian of all were the borderlands of North Britain. Throughout the northern counties of England, and the lowlands of Scotland and northern Ireland, a large part of the best land was owned by a small number of people—many of them absentees. ([Location 11088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11088))
- The pacification of the borders was followed by the eviction of tenants in both England and Scotland. Large numbers of landless poor were created by this process. Local officeholders were compelled to devote much of their attention to this problem of poverty in their region. Many emigrants who sailed from North Britain to America had been the victims of this social process. ([Location 11110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11110))
- Throughout this great region where virgin land existed in abundance, most men were landless. At the same time, a few families owned very large tracts. ([Location 11116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11116))
- The top decile of wealthholders owned between 40 and 80 percent of the land. In many areas, one-third to one-half of taxable white males owned nothing. ([Location 11119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11119))
- The United States Census in 1850 and 1860 found evidence of extreme rural inequalities throughout the old southwest. Studies of eight sample counties of Tennessee in 1850 showed that more than half of all adult males (free and slave altogether) owned no land at all. The top 20 percent owned 82 percent of improved land and 99 percent of the slaves. In between was a rural middle class of yeoman farmers who were a minority of the adult male population of Tennessee in 1850.11 ([Location 11125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11125))
- The same patterns persisted into the twentieth century, when an elaborate study of wealth distribution in eighty counties of Appalachia came to this conclusion:   The image of Appalachia as the land of rugged individuals, owning and working relatively small family holdings, is strong in the literature about the region. But … the reality is a region where the ownership of land is concentrated in relatively few hands. ([Location 11129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11129))
- In 1983, the top 1 percent of owners possessed half of the land in Appalachia. The top 5 percent owned nearly two-thirds. This pattern of wealth distribution in the southern highlands in the twentieth century was much like that which had existed two hundred years earlier. ([Location 11133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11133))
- As these patterns of wealth and inheritance suggest, social stratification in the backcountry was a system of high complexity. Extreme inequalities of material condition were joined to an intense concern for equality of esteem. ([Location 11137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11137))
- Visitors of exalted rank complained that they were not treated with the same respect as in other parts of British America. ([Location 11139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11139))
- a lack of deference to age, wealth, birth and breeding. ([Location 11143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11143))
- Militiamen in the backcountry commonly refused to obey orders from their officers, unless persuaded to do so. ([Location 11144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11144))
- These complaints rose from fundamental differences in social manners and expectations. In the backcountry, rich and poor men dealt with one another more or less as social equals. They wore similar clothing, and addressed each other by first names. They worked, ate, laughed, played, and fought together on a footing of equality. ([Location 11146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11146))
- Despite this equality of manners, a clear-cut system of social status existed in both the borderlands and the backcountry, which differed from ranking customs in other parts of British America. ([Location 11163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11163))
- In the American backcountry this elite rapidly acquired a firm hold on wealth and power throughout the region. They owned a large part of the best lands and held most of the top military and political offices. Their manners tended to be very rough, and were not much refined by their new environment. But they knew who they were, and instantly recognized one another, and cemented their status by ties of marriage and friendship. ([Location 11167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11167))
- This backcountry elite was not distinguished by learning, breeding, intellect or refinement. In consequence, its eminence was always directly contingent upon its wealth and power. ([Location 11174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11174))
- In the southern highlands (and indeed on the southern rim to this day) one rarely finds the tattered respectability of old families in Massachusetts, or the threadbare gentility of tidewater Virginia. ([Location 11175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11175))
- A backcountry family that lost its property fell instantly to a lower level of society, and disappeared from the ascendancy without a trace. The result was a highly materialistic system of social rank. Wealth alone became more important as a determinant of status than in New England, Pennsylvania or Virginia. ([Location 11176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11176))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Below the ascendancy was a middle class which has sometimes been called the “yeomanry” of the southern highlands. ([Location 11178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11178))
- Below this comparatively small backcountry middle class was a large rural proletariat, who owned no land and few personal possessions. Most were either tenants or squatters. Their property ran on four legs—consisting mostly of cattle and swine which they raised in the woods. Their pride was heavily invested in these animals. ([Location 11185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11185))
- In the eighteenth century, this backcountry underclass was called by many names which have become a permanent part of the American language. By and large these words connoted a stubborn combination of poverty and pride which had existed on the borders of north Britain. The words themselves, though now thought of as Americanisms, were also carried from the borderlands. ([Location 11188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11188))
- One such term was hoosier. Everitt Dick writes that   before it was used to designate the citizens of Indiana, the term “Hoosier” was used in the South to describe a rough or uncouth   person. … the name “hoosier” was often applied to these backwoodsmen even as far south as northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas. ([Location 11190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11190))
- The word hoosier comes from hoozer or hoozier in the old Cumberland dialect, which meant something or someone who was unusually large and rough—in W. J. Cash’s phrase, “a hell of a fellow.” After coming to America in the eighteenth century, the noun migrated north to Indiana with so much of backcountry culture, and was attached to the citizens of that state to distinguish them from their Yankee neighbors.

- Another term for this rural proletariat was redneck, which was originally applied to the backsettlers because of their religion. The earliest American example known to this historian was recorded in North Carolina by Anne Royall in 1830, who noted that “red-neck” was “a name bestowed upon the Presbyterians.” It had long been a slang word for religious dissenters in the north of England. ([Location 11199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11199))
- A third word for this rural proletariat which also came from Britain was cracker, which derived from an English pejorative for a low and vulgar braggart. In 1766, an informant wrote the Earl of Dartmouth about the American backcountry,   I should explain to your Lordship what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascals on the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas and Georgia, who often change their abode. ([Location 11203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11203))
- The borderers were a restless people who carried their migratory ways from Britain to America. There had been many folk movements in their history before the Atlantic crossing, and many more were yet to come. The history of these people was a long series of removals—from England to Scotland, from Scotland to Ireland, from Ireland to Pennsylvania, from Pennsylvania to Carolina, from Carolina to the Mississippi Valley, from the Mississippi to Texas, from Texas to California, and from California to the rainbow’s end. ([Location 11215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11215))
- The backcountry ideal was a scattered settlement pattern in isolated farmsteads, loosely grouped in sprawling “neighborhoods” that covered many miles. ([Location 11234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11234))
- The German traveler Schoepf in 1784 observed that in North Carolina the farms were “scattered about in these woods at various distances, three to six miles, and often as much as ten or fifteen or twenty miles apart.”4 North Carolina Congressman Nathaniel Macon startled his Yankee colleagues by arguing that “no man ought to live so near another as to hear his neighbor’s dog bark.”5 That attitude was widely shared in the backcountry. ([Location 11235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11235))
- In this culture, a house became a hermitage, beyond sight and sound of every human habitation. ([Location 11239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11239))
- the idea itself became an important reality in the culture of the backcountry. It persisted for many generations in the isolated homes that were built in the hollows of the Appalachians, the canebreaks of Kentucky, the flatlands of Texas and the ravines of southern California. ([Location 11242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11242))
- Unlike the road-bound settlements of New England or the fluvial patterns of Virginia, the backsettlers built their houses near creeks or springs. ([Location 11253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11253))
- Emma Miles wrote:   The site of a cabin is usually chosen as near as possible to a fine spring. No other advantages will ever make up for the lack of good water. There is a strong prejudice against pumps … cisterns are considered “dead water,” hardly fit to wash one’s face in. The mountaineer takes the same pride in his water supply as the rich man in his wine cellar, and is in this respect a connoisseur. None but the purest and coldest of freestone will satisfy him. ([Location 11254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11254))
- This pattern of settlement engendered a distinctive style of association. Family, friends and neighbors visited one another over long distances, staying in each other’s houses, sleeping in the same beds, eating from the same dish. Few homes were so humble as not to have some accommodation for visitors, even if only a mattress, a stool and a spoon. ([Location 11259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11259))
- There was always a welcome for kin and friends, but an intense suspicion of strangers. This cultural attitude had deep roots in the borderlands of North Britain; one Cumbrian observed that anyone from a neighboring district was looked upon as a “‘foreigner.’” ([Location 11261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11261))
- Backcountry ideas of honor were understood more in terms of valor and virility. To behave dishonorably was to commit an “unmanly act.” Folk punishments in the backcountry were designed to inflict humiliation by depriving an offender of his manhood—sometimes in a direct and literal sense. ([Location 11278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11278))
- That folk saying was a classical expression of backcountry attitudes toward order, which differed very much from other regions of British America. In the absence of any strong sense of order as unity, hierarchy, or social peace, backsettlers shared an idea of order as a system of retributive justice. ([Location 11296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11296))
- The prevailing principle was lex talionis, the rule of retaliation. It held that a good man must seek to do right in the world, but when wrong was done to him he must punish the wrongdoer himself by an act of retribution that restored order and justice in the world. ([Location 11298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11298))
- This backcountry idea of order rested upon an exceptionally strong sense of self-sovereignty. ([Location 11300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11300))
- Something of the same principle had also existed in tidewater Virginia, where the gentry were fond of quoting the old English cliché that every man’s home was his castle. But the people of the backcountry went a step farther. A North Carolina proverb declared that “every man should be sheriff on his own hearth.”2 That folk saying had been brought to the backcountry from the borderlands of North Britain, where it existed in almost the same words: “Every man is a sheriff on his own hearth.”3 This idea implied not only individual autonomy, but autarchy. ([Location 11301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11301))
- Further, it narrowly circumscribed the role of government, for if every man were sheriff on his own hearth, then there was not very much work for a county sheriff to do, except to patrol the roads that lay in between. ([Location 11306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11306))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- The same ideas also appeared in the ordering institutions of the backcountry. There were official sheriff’s and constables throughout that region, but the heaviest work of order-keeping was done by ad hoc groups of self-appointed agents who called themselves regulators in the eighteenth century, vigilantes in the nineteenth, and nightriders in the twentieth. ([Location 11307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11307))
- It rose instead from a tradition of retributive folk justice which had been carried from the British borderlands to the American backcountry. ([Location 11311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11311))
- Vigilante movements began in the southern backcountry during the 1760s. ([Location 11320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11320))
- This system of justice captured the two vital principles of back-country order ways—the idea that order was a system of retributive violence and that each individual was the guardian of his own interests in that respect. ([Location 11329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11329))
- Treatment of the disorderly was also different from other regions of British America. Backcountry courts tended to punish property crimes with the utmost severity, but to be very lenient with crimes of personal violence. In Cumberland County, Virginia, during the eighteenth century, a court administered the following punishments: for hog stealing, death by hanging; for scolding, five shilling fine; for the rape of an eleven-year-old girl, one shilling fine.16 This structure of values continued for many generations in the backcountry. ([Location 11350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11350))
- This system of order created a climate of violence in the American backcountry which remained part of the culture of that region to our own time. ([Location 11356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11356))
- Backcountry proverbs did not glorify fighting for its own sake, but fighting for the sake of winning. Here was an ethic of violence which had been formed in ambuscades and border-raiding. It had nothing to do with combats of chivalry or the idea of war as a gentleman’s game. ([Location 11363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11363))
- This system of order gave rise to a special style of backcountry politics which was far removed from classical ideas of democracy and aristocracy. It was a highly distinctive type of polity which Charles Lee appropriately called “macocracy”—that is, “rule by the race of Macs.” ([Location 11408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11408))
- It was also a polity without strong political institutions, and in that regard very far removed from New England. There was comparatively little formal structure to local government—no town meetings, no vestries, no commissions, and courts of uncertain authority. But within the same broad tradition of self-government common to all English-speaking people, the borderers of North Britain easily improvised their own politics. ([Location 11413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11413))
- Another feature of this backcountry “macocracy” was strong personal leadership. The politics of the back settlements were dominated by leaders who possessed a quality called “influence” or ‘interest.” ([Location 11429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11429))
- These “men of influence” could be found in most parts of the backcountry. They tended to be large landowners, magistrates, merchants, surveyors, millers and speculators—often all at once. But the “influence” and “interest” of these men had narrow limits. The authority of office or rank counted for very little, ([Location 11441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11441))
- The politics of the backcountry consisted mainly of charismatic leaders and personal followings, cemented by strong and forceful acts such as Jackson’s behavior at Jonesboro. The rhetoric that these leaders used sometimes sounded democratic, but it was easily misunderstood by those who were not part of this folk culture. ([Location 11474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11474))
- The Jacksonian movement was a case in point. To easterners, Andrew Jackson looked and sounded like a Democrat. But in his own culture, his rhetoric had a very different function. Historian Thomas Abernethy observes that Andrew Jackson never championed the cause of the people; he merely invited the people to champion him. This was a style of politics which placed a heavy premium upon personal loyalty. In the American backcountry, as on the British borders, loyalty was the most powerful cement of political relationships. Disloyalty was the primary political sin. ([Location 11477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11477))
- For many generations, back-country politics were mainly a collision of highly personal factions and followings, rather than ethnic blocs or ideological parties or social classes. Charismatic appeals carried elections, which tended to be decided on questions of personal style. ([Location 11488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11488))
- No matter whether they came from the England or Scotland or Ireland, their libertarian ideas were very much alike—and profoundly different from notions of liberty that had been carried to Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania. ([Location 11501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11501))
- The traveler Johann Schoepf was much interested in ideas of law and liberty which he found in the backcountry. “They shun everything which appears to demand of them law and order, and anything that preaches constraint,” Schoepf wrote of the backsettlers. “They hate the name of a justice, and yet they are not transgressors. Their object is merely wild. Altogether, natural freedom … is what pleases them.” ([Location 11503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11503))
- The backcountry idea of natural liberty was created by a complex interaction between the American environment and a European folk culture. It derived in large part from the British border country, where anarchic violence had long been a condition of life. The natural liberty of the borderers was an idea at once more radically libertarian, more strenuously hostile to ordering institutions than were the other cultures of British America. ([Location 11508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11508))
- Throughout his political career, Patrick Henry consistently defended the principles of minimal government, light taxes, and the right of armed resistance to authority in all cases which infringed liberty. ([Location 11520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11520))
- Patrick Henry went on to introduce the Virginia Resolves, which ended by declaring that all who dissented from his view of the question should be treated as an “enemy to this his Majesty’s Colony”—a classical expression of the intolerance for contrary opinions which was part of the backcountry’s idea of natural liberty. ([Location 11532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11532))
- This idea of natural liberty was not a reciprocal idea. It did not recognize the right of dissent or disagreement. Deviance from cultural norms was rarely tolerated; opposition was suppressed by force. ([Location 11561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11561))
- One of Andrew Jackson’s early biographers observed that “It appears to be more difficult for a North-of-Irelander than for other men to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent, so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous.” ([Location 11563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11563))
- This libertarian idea of natural freedom as “elbow room” was very far from the ordered freedom of New England towns, the hegemonic freedom of Virginia’s county oligarchs, and the reciprocal freedom of Pennsylvania Quakers. Here was yet another freedom way which came to be rooted in the culture of an American region, where it flourished for many years to come. ([Location 11569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11569))
- Most broad areas of consensus in American life have grown from values that these cultures shared in common. Many major conflicts in American history have developed primarily from their differences. Every presidential election shows their persistent power in American politics. Every decennial census finds that cultural differences between American regions are greater in some ways than those between European nations. ([Location 11584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11584))
- Of all the determinants which shaped the cultural character of British America, the most powerful was religion. During the seventeenth century, the English-speaking people were deeply divided by the great questions of the Protestant Reformation. These divisions in turn created a broad spectrum of English denominations in the New World. ([Location 11721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=11721))

- Some of its founding families came from the West Indies; others were French Huguenots, and more than a few were emigrants from tidewater Virginia. Three-quarters of the low-country population in 1790 were slaves who came mostly from the Congo basin and the coast of Angola. These groups rapidly developed their own unique customs and institutions, which were closer to the Caribbean colonies than to the Chesapeake.

- Speech ways were heavily influenced by the “Gullah” (Angola) dialect of the black majority. Building ways were a unique amalgam of Caribbean, French, African and English elements. Patterns of settlement were marked by the highest level of urbanization in colonial America: nearly 25 percent of low-country whites lived in Charleston. The wealth of its white families was the greatest in the colonies (£450 in 1740), and highly concentrated in a few hands. The annual rhythm of life was regulated by a pattern of transhumance that did not exist in other mainland colonies.11 This area became a distinct cultural region, but it never developed into a major cultural hearth.

- The political history of this culture was very different from its border neighbors. During the American Revolution the borderers were mostly Whig; Scottish highlanders were mainly Tory. In the new republic, the backsettlers tended to vote Democratic-Republican, and the highlanders of the Cape Fear Valley voted Federalist.

The purpose of New England’s War for Independence, as stated both by ministers and by laymen such as John and Samuel Adams, was not to secure the rights of man in any universal sense.

- Ironically, while the omnibus politics of the second party system were disguising regional differences, the effect of cultural and material change in the early nineteenth century was to reinforce them—and also to change their nature. New England and the middle states became more similar to one another, and increasingly different from the coastal and southern highlands. The effect of these tendencies was to combine regions into sections. That pattern had not existed in the United States before 1820. The words “north” and “south” were rarely used in a sectional sense during the early years of the republic. But they developed very rapidly.

- ways. In addition to the old dialects of northern, midland, coastal southern and highland southern speech, three others have appeared in the twentieth century. ([Location 12937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=12937))
- New York English developed from a distinctive mixture of northern and midland speech, enriched by central European and Jewish languages, California English combines highland southern and midland speech with many Hispanic expressions. ([Location 12939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=12939))
- Great Basin English brings together northern, midland and highland southern speech ways in a syncretist accent which is beginning to emerge as American standard speech. In the late twentieth century, national television broad-casters are trained to use the accent of Salt Lake City—the American equivalent of BBC English.

- The persistence of American regionalism also appeared in every federal census, which continues even today to yield evidence of greater differences between American regions than among European nations. Further, these patterns show remarkably strong linkages with the distant colonial past. ([Location 12957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=12957))
- A less colorful but more promising explanation is cast in institutional terms. At an early date, each regional culture developed its own institutions of order and violence which have persisted powerfully through time. The laws of New England have always given little latitude to violence. ([Location 12981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=12981))
- The laws of New England are actively supported by other institutions. For more than three centuries town schools have taught children not to use violence to solve their social problems. Town meetings strongly condemn internal violence. Town elites teach others by example that violence is not an acceptable form of social behavior in New England. In short, violence “isn’t done” in the prescriptive sense. And when it is done, the regional culture of New England has little tolerance for violent acts, and punishes them severely.

- Why have regional cultures persisted for so long a period in Anglo-America? How does any culture persist? ([Location 13029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13029))
- Cultural persistence is not the same as stasis. Many things must happen if a culture is to be transmitted from one generation to the next. ([Location 13034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13034))
- This process of cultural persistence may be studied from many different perspectives. One obvious approach centers on the ways in which individual people learn their social roles. Some of the most important instruments of cultural persistence operate within schools, churches and families, where children learn to do what is expected of them. Other institutions continue the socializing process through every stage of life. Each of the four cultural regions of British America, as we have seen, kept its own customs of enculturation for many generations. ([Location 13036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13036))
- A second and very different perspective on persistence centers on the functional interdependence of a culture’s various parts. Material and ethical structures, for example, tend to be mutually reinforcing. To change a culture in any fundamental way, one must transform many things at once—no easy task, as many a reformer has learned. Social institutions tend to perpetuate themselves, and have their own means of doing so. These institutional imperatives are powerful instruments of continuity in a cultural system. ([Location 13040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13040))
- Yet another perspective on cultural persistence focuses on the conduct of elites. There is a cultural equivalent of the iron law of oligarchy; small groups dominate every cultural system. They tend to do so by controlling institutions and processes, so that they become the “governors” of a culture in both a political and a mechanical sense. ([Location 13044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13044))
- fostered at least four different ideas of liberty within a common cultural frame. ([Location 13060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13060))
- These four libertarian traditions were not forms of classical republicanism or European liberalism—even as those alien ideologies were often borrowed as rationales, American ideas of freedom developed from indigenous folkways which were deeply rooted in the inherited culture of the English-speaking world. ([Location 13060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13060))
- The Puritan idea of ordered freedom was no sooner brought to Massachusetts than it became an instrument of savage persecution. ([Location 13064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13064))
- The cavalier conception of hegemonic freedom, when carried to Virginia, permitted and even required the growth of race slavery for its support. ([Location 13065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13065))
- The Quaker vision of reciprocal freedom was a sectarian impulse which could be sustained only by withdrawal from the world. ([Location 13066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13066))
- The backcountry belief in natural freedom sometimes dissolved into cultural anarchy. ([Location 13067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13067))
- New England’s Puritan faith in ordered freedom grew far beyond its original limits to become, in Perry Miller’s words, “a constellation of ideas basic to any comprehension of the American mind.” ([Location 13068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13068))
- Virginia’s cavalier conceit of hegemonic freedom transcended its association with inequalities of rank and race and gender to become an ethical idea that is relevant to all. ([Location 13069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13069))
- Pennsylvania’s Quaker inspiration of reciprocal freedom developed from a fragile sectarian vision into a libertarian creed remarkable for toughness of mind and tenacity of purpose. ([Location 13070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13070))
- Border and backcountry notions of natural freedom evolved from a folk tradition into an elaborate ideology. ([Location 13072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEKM9C&location=13072))
- The most important fact about American liberty is that it has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even contrary traditions in creative tension with one another. This diversity of libertarian ideas has created a culture of freedom which is more open and expansive than any unitary tradition alone could possibly be. It has also become the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society in the United States. In time, this plurality of freedoms may prove to be that nation’s most enduring legacy to the world.
