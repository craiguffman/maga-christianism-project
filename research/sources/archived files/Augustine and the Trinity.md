### Highlights

- One of my own central arguments in this book will be that while recent scholarship has rightly emphasized Augustine’s insistence on the irreducibility of the persons, we can push further and see him as moving, in the decade between 410 and 420, towards a sophisticated account of the divine communion as resulting from the eternal intra-divine acts of the divine three. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=269))
- In this emphasis Augustine is, I will suggest, revealed as one of the most interesting and important interpreters of Nicaea’s ‘God from God and Light from Light’. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=273))
- In a way parallel to the best of the ressourcement movement during the twentieth century, this new reading suggests that while Augustine is at times a precursor of medieval concerns, at many points he is pursuing a different agenda in a different theological and philosophical context. The emergence of this new Augustine, then, need not be tied to an attempt to supplant Thomas, but to present others alongside Thomas as sources for the Catholic theologian. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=278))
- I intend that this book contribute to these revisionist readings by focusing on two themes: Augustine’s struggles to articulate the Trinitarian communion or life of the three irreducible ‘persons’; his developing understanding of how we grow in understanding of the Trinity, how we progress towards the contemplation of God that is a participation in the Trinitarian life. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=281))
- Augustine understands Christian life as a growth towards a contemplation that is also a participation in the divine life. Augustine sees this growth as occurring through the reformation of the soul by Christ and Spirit. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=298))
- Augustine sees the Spirit as active within the Body of Christ, demonstrating that for all his insistence on the interior leading of the individual Christian, Augustine sees the work of sanctification as a corporate and ecclesial work. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=301))
- Augustine views the process by which the mind moves from obsession with the material towards contemplation of the divine as a constitutive part of the purification that is salvation, and as occurring in the two-natured Christ, through participation in Christ’s body. ([Location 4307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4307))
- Augustine reads 1 Corinthians 15.24–8 as an eschatological narrative in conjunction with Matthew 5.8 (‘the pure in heart shall see God’) to show that there is a progress towards vision at the end, when the pure in heart gaze upon the form of a servant, and see ‘through’ that form the form of God in equality with Father and Spirit. Neither the Old Testament theophanies nor the Incarnation itself make God available to sight; they enable a faith that knows it will become sight and knowledge only at the end. ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4333))
- A central aspect of Augustine’s rule is used here as the hermeneutic key to 1 Corinthians 15.28: ‘the man Jesus Christ’ has his purpose in leading the just towards contemplation of the Trinity – his incarnate materiality draws us towards his nature as the immaterial and fully divine Son. ([Location 4403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4403))
- Most importantly, Augustine’s clarity about the nature of this contemplation casts all knowing and seeing prior to that state as faith and not sight, albeit a faith heading towards sight. ([Location 4412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4412))
- Augustine tells us that he uses the term spiritualis for his second kind on the basis of 1 Corinthians 14.14–15 (‘if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also’) to designate a ‘seeing’ that involves the awareness or articulation of signs or images without the understanding that comes from intellectual vision. Spiritual vision by itself may mislead; coupled with intellectual vision it may lead to true contemplation. ([Location 4419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4419))
- And yet he struggles to describe this third vision. In one sense it is easy: intellectual vision is never deceived because it is a direct sight in ‘the light of the mind’; its objects include the virtues by which we are purified and, in some sense, God (insofar as the divine may be seen even by the purified mind) in whom are all things.22 And yet, because Augustine is increasingly convinced of the fallen mind’s inability to escape from images of bodies, he presents pure intellectual vision as accessible only through a divine rapture away from the world of images to a direct sight, love, possession and rest in the intellectual, the Truth itself, the Light that informs all understanding.23 This vision is of the ‘Glory of the Lord’, and is a vision also described as a speaking ‘face to face’ with the mind. Thus, ‘intellectual vision’ is misunderstood unless it is also seen as a participation in the Word himself.24 ([Location 4428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4428))
- That intellectual vision involves at its highest a turn from seeing the virtues towards seeing the Truth which renders them possible and illumines all judgement remains clear. ([Location 4447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4447))
- Thus, in the vocabulary he uses, Augustine reveals himself to be developing a notion of contemplation (of the divine), that is Platonist in origin, but pro-Nicene in purpose. While his Latin pro-Nicene contemporaries certainly consider the vision of God to be non-corporeal, Augustine outlines a non-corporeal vision beyond any bodily image, attainable (except in fleeting instances) only at the end of the process of purification, and this clear sense of such contemplation may allow him to focus the distinction between faith and sight with peculiar clarity.30 In general terms, then, this discussion of intellectual vision provides the basic dynamics of how Augustine understands the highest level of understanding and ascent: it is both that in which faith culminates and the goal of the intellectual exercises we discussed in Chapter 5. As we will see more fully towards the end of this chapter, it is also that to which grace draws us. ([Location 4461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4461))
- Christ simultaneously helps Philip to grasp that faith stands in for sight until the eschaton and that what may be seen in the body does not enable us to understand what is or what will be seen at the end. ([Location 4480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4480))
- Augustine thus sees a direct link between accepting that contemplation of Father, Son and Spirit is the goal of Christian life, and recognizing that faith entails a discipline in our seeing and imagining of the material (and of the material insinuations embedded in the language of faith), a discipline in which we learn not to take the material for that towards which it should draw us. ([Location 4483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4483))
- Trinitarian faith, then, requires a constant negotiation between the language of temporality, materiality and division intrinsic to Scripture and our ability to grasp the character of the final vision. It is of note in this passage that it is Christ who teaches us in such a way that we embrace this negotiation, and thus are drawn down the path towards greater understanding ([Location 4486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4486))
- Philip should believe (although he cannot see) that to see the Son is to see the Father because this belief will be fulfilled. One of the constitutive tasks of our journey down the path towards understanding of faith is, then, to grow in the ability to hone these correspondences, identifying and applying the principles that allow us to ‘look’ beyond the created categories within which Scripture speaks. ([Location 4491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4491))
- Augustine identifies the core of the life of faith (and the core of what Christ teaches) as a movement of the attention. ([Location 4496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4496))
- The ‘touch’ of which Augustine speaks refers, first, to the touch that the apostles (paradigmatically Thomas) sought as a reinforcement for their faith. But, second, this touch also stands for our ‘touching’ in faith. Christ wished that the only limit set to our faith be the eschatological sight of the Trinity, and thus that we ‘touch’ in faith only in order to confess what lies beyond sight and touch. ([Location 4512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4512))
- Understanding Christ’s teaching about the divine is thus inseparable from following the path of the attention that Christ also teaches – and failure to see that Christ teaches and draws the attention beyond the material is a failure that renders good conception of the Trinity impossible. This theme will eventually enable us to note some of the ways in which what might seem to be a certain intellectualism in Augustine – his linking of understanding the Trinity to the complex task of thinking the intelligible – is much complicated by his emphasis on the priority he gives to the formation of desire for God and confession of divine mystery. ([Location 4568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4568))
- But, Augustine argues, the desire true faith stimulates is in tension. On the one hand this faith is a trust in the correspondence between what happened to Christ and what will happen to us, and a trust that our ‘sight’ of Christ in faith will be fulfilled in eternal and true sight. On the other hand, Moses is paradigmatic because he desires a vision of that which he knows to transcend him. Faith thus results in a desire to enter into that which is known as mysterious. ([Location 4687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4687))
- Augustine sees humility (and the desire for grace) as an essential component of this desire, both because of his (by this stage) well-established sense that only God can give the understanding that is identical to participation in the divine life, and because such humility is the only faithful response to recognition of the divine transcendence. ([Location 4691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4691))
- Faith . . . exercises a purifying effect on the soul by continuing to remind it that it cannot understand the realities disclosed by God by relying on its own efforts. This self-knowledge, achieved in humility, draws the soul into a deeper love of God.67 ([Location 4694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4694))
- Augustine holds together two themes: first, because humility before God is at the core of a true approach to God the unlearned Christian may be as ‘spiritual’ as the one most able to follow Augustine’s speculative flights;74 second, the understanding of doctrinal faith is a task of speculative improvisation, a drawing together of scriptural hint and dialectical skill to look towards the outer rim of what may be grasped as we attempt to think how Scripture’s speech about God is true, but is true of a reality beyond the temporal and the material. ([Location 4730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4730))
- All of those discussions are explorations of how we may imagine the correspondence between Scripture’s language and the mystery of which Scripture speaks; but insofar as they are this, they are all also conceived as explorations of that which will only be ‘seen’ when faith gives way to the contemplation of the purified soul knowing itself and the three by whom it is filled. ([Location 4757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4757))
- The perfection of love in Christ lies at the heart of the true ascent. ([Location 4763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4763))
- ultimately Christ is not merely a model for, but the context within which, our ascent occurs. ([Location 4766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4766))
- The sight of contemplation is merited only by our faith and, Augustine suggests, it is through God’s action that we are drawn into faith and towards contemplation. ([Location 4774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4774))
- this ascent towards contemplation is understood by Augustine to be facilitated for the Christian by acceptance in humility of the need to be carried on the ‘wood’ – a term which symbolizes both Church and the cross – towards a goal that he or she may not even grasp as yet. At the heart of Augustine’s distinction between the humble Christian and the proud philosopher is the latter’s pride in assuming that this passage can be made virtute propria, ‘by their own strength’.82 ([Location 4793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4793))
- The passage’s contrast between the prideful philosopher and the humble Christian shows in allusive form some of the links between Augustine’s understanding of our participation in Christ as the means of salvation and his understanding of the necessity of grace. ([Location 4797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4797))
- Like the predecessors on whom he drew, Augustine understands Trinitarian theology to be an exercise that, however internally Catholic its audience, finds its most significant contemporary ‘others’ in the Homoian tradition. At the same time Augustine, again like many other Catholic writers of his period, treats heretical positions as also constant possibilities for the Catholic mind, and thus exposing what he sees as materialistic Homoian exegesis is also to expose the Catholic’s constant temptation.96 This tendency to link external heresy and internal temptation is matched by a vision of different heretical positions as sharing a failure to grasp the structure and necessity of the Word’s descent into flesh.97 ([Location 4875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4875))
- Augustine gradually treats the different anti-Nicene arguments he considers as variations of a common failure to understand what it means for Christ to have been a visible revelation of the invisible. To understand the character of and need for faith in a visible revealing of the eternally invisible co-eternal Son is, Augustine argues, to understand the purpose and integrity of Nicene exegesis. Defending the centrality of the Incarnation leads Augustine to incorporate and develop much of his refutation of Platonist pride and Platonist failure to understand the role of authority. He thus further interweaves polemical targets, linking Platonist pride with Homoian. ([Location 4886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4886))
- Thus Augustine’s critique of Platonism (and his adaptation of it) is a constant background theme through the De trinitate, but I have resisted the urge to treat this work as primarily an engagement with the Platonist tradition. Such an assumption I take to be problematic because it ignores the extensive theological engagement with Homoian and Catholic positions evident through much of the work, and because it seems to stem from a scholarly world-view wherein the significant engagements are philosophical (and ontological). We are better founded, I suggest, when we note the skill with which Augustine interweaves a variety of critiques through an argument always theological in focus (however much the philosophical is thereby unavoidable and a constant companion).99 ([Location 4891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=4891))
- Augustine’s first rule, examined in Chapter 6, is not concerned only with the manner in which we should distinguish Scripture’s statements about Christ, but also with the movement towards contemplation into which Christ and Scripture draw Christians. Similarly, while Augustine’s second rule concerns scriptural texts that reveal only that Son or Spirit are ‘from’ the Father (and not ontologically subordinate to the Father), his exposition of the rule reveals the manner in which the sending of Son and Spirit, and their work in the created order, is founded in their manner of procession from the Father. Exploration of this topic both reveals the centrality of the Father’s status in Augustine’s mature Trinitarian theology, ([Location 5237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5237))
- That good interpretation of texts describing the divine existence depends upon a grasp of the relationship between Creator and creation has been central to Augustine’s argument since the initial discussions of De trinitate 1. There Augustine links the necessity of the Son being eiusdem substantiae with the Father to the Son’s place in the relationship between created and uncreated existence through exegesis of John 1.3. The Son cannot be one of the things ‘made through him’ described in John 1.3, and is of the same substance as the Father because all that is not created is God.39 Augustine thus insinuates into the argument a clear principle that makes the ultimate distinction not between material and immaterial, or between sensible and intelligible, but between created and uncreated. Immediately Augustine presents as a logical consequence that 1 Timothy 6.16 must refer to the Son and Spirit as well as the Father. Because (following 1 John 5.20) the Son is ‘eternal life’, the Son must not be subject to any change, and hence must also possess the immortality of which 1 Timothy 6.16 speaks. Augustine here also assumes that to speak of the Creator and of eternal life is to speak of that in which Christians are made sharers. To understand that Christ is uncreated rather than created is, for Augustine, to understand that Christ’s life is the source of our continuing to live and of our eternal life. The uncreated must be life itself (and divinity does not come in degrees).40 ([Location 5493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5493))
- It is, however, in De trinitate 3 that Augustine explores directly the distinction between Creator and creation. The discussion of the angelic mediation Augustine thinks to be operative in the Old Testament ‘theophanies’ that occupies much of this book – and much of this book’s earliest stratum – is easily overlooked by the modern reader. To do so is a mistake. Leaving aside the later prologue to the book, around two-thirds of the text offers what amounts to a short treatise on the character of divine presence.41 Augustine summarizes thus: the will of God, who makes his angels, spirits and his ministers a blazing fire, resides [in that higher and heavenly country] among spirits who are bound together in perfect peace and friendship, and melted together into one will by a kind of spiritual fire . . . From there he diffuses himself through all things by certain most orderly movements of the creature [ordinatissimis creaturae motibus]. But as grosser and lower bodies are directed in a certain order by subtler and stronger bodies, so all bodies are directed by the spirit of life: the irrational spirit of life by the rational spirit of life, the truant and sinful rational spirit of life by the rational, pious and just spirit of life, and the latter by its Creator, from whom, through whom, and in whom [cf. Rom. 11.36] it has also been created and established.42 ([Location 5506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5506))
- While man plants and waters, who draws up the moisture through the root of the vine to the cluster of grapes and makes the wine except God who gives the growth? But when water was changed into wine with unaccustomed swiftness at the Lord’s command the divine power was revealed, as even fools acknowledge.43 Thus in the Eucharist also, the invisible and omnipotent… ([Location 5520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5520))
- the ‘will of God’ who binds the angels into one will ‘through something like a blazing fire’ and that which is responsible for the ordering of things is probably the Spirit. This language occurs a number of times in De trinitate 3, but Augustine shows little interest in careful delineation of roles here and primarily seeks to emphasize the joint working of the divine Will and Wisdom.49 He is, however, very clear about the role of the divine Wisdom. Wisdom is that which ‘reaches from end to end . . . and orders all things well’ (Wisd. 8.1), which governs all things and in whom the ‘seeds’ of all are contained.50 The first cause of all is that unchangeable Wisdom which governs the wise man, and the angels.51 ([Location 5541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5541))
- The account given in De trinitate 3 directly mirrors Augustine’s account, in De doctrina 2, of the manner in which the wise worshippers of the divine are able to think beyond the corporeal towards a transcendent God. Just as Christ uses his flesh – and fleshly words – to draw us towards the mystery of God, the triune God constructs and governs the intelligible created order such that it may draw the mind towards knowledge and love of, and humility before, its Creator. ([Location 5556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5556))
- We can, however, say that, for Augustine, learning to imagine the created order thus, learning to recognize that it is so, is an important part of the restoration of sight that faith effects and which will be fulfilled when faith becomes sight. At the same time, Augustine seems to see our reimagining of the created order as an essential part of our learning to think through the Trinitarian communion. Growing in understanding that the divine transcends the creation and operates through, in and with a sui generis power and by an immediate and mysterious presence helps us in the imagining of the divine three and their relations beyond corporeal imagery. Even in the case of those not gifted in such flights of the intellectual life, appropriate awe at the created order and humility at God’s power in it perform an important function for Augustine.52 ([Location 5561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5561))
- In the second tractate on John, Augustine turns again to the language of light, this time emphasizing its omnipresence. He does so in order to cast the character of our ignorance as that of the blind person in the presence of the sun and, hence, in order to cast the shape of our return, of faith as a ‘lamp’ by which we see the light.69 Coming to John 1.10’s ‘he was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not’, Augustine makes further use of the craftsman analogy: Do not imagine that he was in the world in such a way as the earth is in the world, the sky is in the world . . . But how was he? As the master builder who governs what he has made. For he did not make it in the way a craftsman makes a chest. The chest which he makes is external to him; and when it is constructed, it has been situated in another place . . . Suffusing the world, God creates; being everywhere, God creates [deus autem mundo infusus fabricat, ubique positus fabricat]; he does not direct the structure which he constructs as someone on the outside. By the presence of his majesty he makes what he makes; by his own presence he governs what he has made [praesentia sua gubernat quod fecit].70 As in De trinitate 3, God governs by his immediate presence to all. This account expands that picture by emphasizing that God must thus create without making ‘space’ for it. ([Location 5634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5634))
- Against Homoian triadologies, and against Manichaean accounts of the hierarchies of divine and created being, Augustine sets out an account of the distinction between creation and Creator in which all exists in the Wisdom of God and is governed by this Wisdom. But this is also the Wisdom eternally spoken by the Father, inseparable from and omnipresent with the Father, and the Wisdom complemented by the Spirit who completes the creation, maintains it in form and moves it towards its Creator – which is also to move the creation towards permanence in the Spirit itself who is one with Father and Son. That there is a hierarchy within the created order is clear – we have already seen Augustine speak of God governing through the rational spiritual realities of soul and angels and thus on into the material world. But the existence of this hierarchy must always be held in tension with the order without hierarchy that characterizes God’s governing through Word and in Spirit, and which characterizes God’s immediate presence to all. ([Location 5657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5657))
- At this point, we see very clearly how much Augustine envisages the language of faith as a guide towards the comprehension of that which lies before us, but from which we are so easily hidden. ([Location 5670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004G5YXIA&location=5670))
