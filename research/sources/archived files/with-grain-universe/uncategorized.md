- Preface  
*Tags: [file] [question]*

---

### - In the preface to his published 2001 Gifford lectures, Stanley Hauerwas emphasized how important it is for Christians to remember that theology is a means, not an end. The end is prayer, which is simultaneously our posture and substance whenever we are fully human. Therefore, he cautions us against staking out theological positions more settled than prayer. The point is not to ensure we hold orthodox positions but to help us converse with God in faithful prayer.

- [Building connections between notes is a crucial aspect of effective note-taking and learning. However, this process requires effort and active thinking to truly understand and retain the information. Therefore, to learn effectively, it is important to actively engage with the material, seek out connections between concepts, and strive for a deeper understanding. By doing so, you can build a strong foundation of knowledge that will enable you to connect new information with existing ideas and continue to learn and grow.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=ipmPulfons_V)

- ["Niebuhr assumed with his liberal forebears that theology was first and foremost an account of human existence."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=hlMXMYWVX8)
- ["the difference between Niebuhr and Barth is exactly the difference between a theology that has given up on its ability to tell us the way the world is and a theology that confidently and unapologetically proclaims the way things are - a distinction that is unintelligible if the God Christians worship does not exist."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Qx1cRCZwn4)
- ["That is the heart of Niebuhr's ethics. Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized virtue of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance. Catholicism, the Renaissance, Calvinism, and the sectarian Protestants: Niebuhr judges them all to be mistaken attempts to make an ethic of sanctification a reality. These historical options, to be sure in quite different ways, result in a false attempt to make history conform to perfect love, or frustrated by the attempt, their adherents undertake an irresponsible withdrawal from the world."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=4s12KykKAO)
- ["For Niebuhr, sanctification in the realm of social relations demands recognition of the impossibility of sanctification."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=rAFb-ucAuL)

### - [ ] "The point that apocalyptic makes is not only that people who wear crowns and who claim to foster justice by the sword are not as strong as they think - true as that is we still sing, "O where are Kings and Empires now of old that went and came?" It is that people who bear crosses are working with the grain of the universe. One does not come that belief by reducing social process to mechanical and statistical models, nor by winning some of one's battles for the control of one's own corner of the fallen world. One comes to it by sharing the life of those who sing about the resurrection of the slain Lamb."

### - Niebuhrian Christianity begins with the premise that secular science speaks the truth about the world and that theology's role is to explain how Christianity fits within secularity's description. That is, it concedes Christianity's incapacity "to tell us the way the world is." In contrast, Barthian Christianity begins with the premise that God reveals the truth about the world and calls Christians to construct lives that witness to the reality of God's dynamic, ongoing reconciling presence. 
- **Highlight**:

- ["On the other hand, for those who believe, as I do, that the truth of Christian convictions requires a recovery of the confident use of Christian speech about God, speech that cannot help but put us at odds with Niebuhr-like accounts of ethics, then the newfound intelligibility of Barth's theology is surely good news. Niebuhr's theology reflects the loss of truthful Christian speech and, hence, of faithful Christian practice."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=NZy_tPNaoU)
- [In spite of Niebuhr's early identification as a"neo-orthodox"theologian, he always worked within the "givens"of Protestant Liberalism, which means, at the very least, that Niebuhr, like James, assumed that Christianity must be tested by standards generally accepted by the intellectual elites of the day."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Ak9PI2lSAw)
- ["Niebuhr's work now represents the worst of two worlds: most secular people do not find his theological arguments convincing; yet his theology is not sufficient to provide the means for Christians to sustain their lives. If Niebuhr's account of Christian theology is no longer persuasive, it is surely bad news for those who believe that the future of Christianity depends on a concordat with liberal social and political arrangements."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=wE7fwuxcIk)
- ["Under Niebuhr's influence, theology-particularly in America-became ethics, and ethics became the investigation of the conditions necessary to make a liberal social order work."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=WL7zFHebvI)
- [Niebuhr did not seek to offer "an alternative to the world," "which is why he could not help but become the theologian of a domesticated god capable of doing no more than providing comfort to the anxious conscience of the bourgeoisie."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=E4hDonqiqy)
- ["I think anyone who would put Niebuhr on the side of the angels must come to terns with the extraordinary "thinness" of his theology. Niebuhr's god is not a god capable of offering salvation in any material sense. Changed self-understanding or attitude is no substitute for the existence of a church capable of offering an alternative to the world."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=jH2KQdicgJ)
- [Niebuhr's "theology sought to make Christian belief intelligible within the naturalistic presumptions that he thought were a prerequisite of modern science. His ethics sought to make Christian belief intelligible and even useful within the presuppositions of political liberalism."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=BEp6KcPFxa)
- ["That is the heart of Niebuhr's ethics. Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized virtue of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance. Catholicism, the Renaissance, Calvinism, and the sectarian Protestants: Niebuhr judges them all to be mistaken attempts to make an ethic of sanctification a reality. These historical options, to be sure in quite different ways, result in a false attempt to make history conform to perfect love, or frustrated by the attempt, their adherents undertake an irresponsible withdrawal from the world."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=4s12KykKAO)
- ["Niebuhr assumed with his liberal forebears that theology was first and foremost an account of human existence."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=hlMXMYWVX8)
- [Drawing on what he thought he had learned from James, Niebuhr sought to defend Christianity as more than a "necessary illusion." But the continuing influence of James makes it unclear if Niebuhr can really mount such a defense, given that James, as we saw, was probably trying to say no more than Becker: Christianity is nothing more than a disguised humanism, and theology is really anthropology."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=gmOtFEASn7)
- ["the difference between Niebuhr and Barth is exactly the difference between a theology that has given up on its ability to tell us the way the world is and a theology that confidently and unapologetically proclaims the way things are - a distinction that is unintelligible if the God Christians worship does not exist."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Qx1cRCZwn4)
- ["If in our current cultural climate, [William] James (or James-like positions) seems for many an attractive alternative to Niebuhr, it is simply because the Christian veneer that was once thought necessary for our societies is no longer needed. Why go through Niebuhr's verbal gymnastics to save the "symbols" of Christianity when James can give you everything Niebuhr wanted in a less confused way?"](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=C6L_WChjtO)
- ["That Niebuhr's account of the human condition still seems persuasive to many is not surprising - for no matter how desiccated Niebuhr's account of Christianity may be, people formed by a liberal social order cannot even begin to imagine that they might accept the Christian faith on any other terms. Niebuhr's account of "original sin" is a comforting doctrine for a people so formed, because Niebuhr makes sin intelligible, a given of the human condition, without requiring a transformation of the self through the formation provided by the church-an odd position for a thinker who claims to be a pragmatist."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=8Y_59fOsoU)
- ["Theological liberals after Niebuhr often want his theology without his ethics; and political conservatives, like "atheists for Niebuhr," often want his ethics without his theology."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=9QbNKbt9k-)
- [Niebuhr "could not believe that "church" might name a people in service to a God who has set them off from the world. Nor could he see anything other than absurdity in the notion that the existence of such a people is necessary for any account of the truths of faith. Yet without an account of the church, Niebuhr has even less to offer Christians that [William] James does."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=k3zXRX4PsK)
- [Quoting Niebuhr's Nature and Destiny of Man: "The sorry annals of Christian fanaticism, of unholy religious hatreds, of sinful ambitions hiding behind the cloak of religious sanctity, of political power impulses compounded with pretensions of devotion to God, offer the most irrefutable proof of the error in every Christian doctrine and every interpretation of the Christian experience which claim that grace can remove the final contradiction between man and God. The sad experiences of Christian history show how human pride and spiritual arrogance rise to new heights precisely at the point where the claims of sanctity are made without due qualifications."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=LfhfcFMJ5T)
- ["In contrast to [William] James, Niebuhr thought that the great enemies of the moral life are those who seek to be holy."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=PfSaeZ0wjE)
- ["But exactly because we are sinners we cannot and should not try to make the law of love a realized possibility in our relations with one another. Niebuhr acknowledges that Jesus' ethics of sacrificial love may be a possibility for relations between two individuals, but as soon as a third person is introduced into the relation, even "the most perfect love requires a rational estimate of conflicting needs and interests" (2:248) Accordingly, the cross - the symbol of sacrificial love - must stand on the edge of history acting as an indiscriminate norm that judges all our attempts to attain justice."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Cr4z7ytRR4)
- ["According to Niebuhr, the ultimate requirements of the Christian ethic-"love thy neighbor as thyself," "love the Lord thy God," and "be not anxious"-are not counsels of perfection that merely "top" natural goodness. Rather, they are basic requirements that are structured into our freedom. We see them as counsels of perfection only because as sinners we are incapable of achieving them."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=AnslDvJE8k)
- ["Niebuhr insists that the "law of love," that is, the disinterested regard we owe one another, is required by "the real structure of life" (275). We are created in a manner that makes it impossible for us to realize ourselves without the other. We can be ourselves only in loving relations with our fellows."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=9AFGx9daqE)
- [Niebuhr's "ethical naturalism leads John Milbank to suggest rightly that Niebuhr's ethics is Stoicism restated in Christian terms."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=zyn_xeos9e)
- ["...according to Nicbuhr, the problem is not atheism but an idolatrous worship of a false god."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Fd7wCYCD_j)
- ["James thought that pragmatism named those aspects of our lives that require the existence of habits acquired through training. In contrast, Niebuhr's ethic names a change in attitude, such that we learn to accept that the way things are is the way things have to be."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=6zlt1Y4F38)
- ["Song argues that it may even be far too generous to think that Niebuhr's theology is ultimately focused on God at all, even a unitarian God. Rather, from beginning to end Niebuhr's primary aim was to give "significance to human finitude, and in particular to prompting people 'to accept their historical responsibilities gladly."'](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=egI6rOCFPK)
- ["It appears that for Niebuhr God is nothing more than the name of our need to believe that life has an ultimate unity that transcends the world's chaos and makes possible what order we can achieve in this life."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=U28Hd5Rcnc)
- ["it is hard to think that Niebuhr's God is anything more or less than an unavoidable aspect of our consciousness."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=0yz-zkOiJn)
- ["Just as sin describes our nature, so Christ and the cross describe our destiny. And, as Niebuhr sees it, in both cases the descriptions, though absurd, are open to validation."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=OaEzGgzUnE)
- ["For Niebuhr, Christ and the cross are not realities limited to the specific revelation found in Christianity; rather, they are symbols of the tensions we must endure as people who expect history to be fulfilled, who expect "a Christ."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=f7GuOEmaqw)
- ["Niebuhr's "Christology" begins and ends with his understanding of the cross as the historical revelation of God's love, which always transcends history."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=7oZfewx6mT)
- ["As it turns out, the revelation that is required for us to know Niebuhr's god is but a reflection of ourselves."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=S6xB_CzxBK)
- ["In short, Niebuhr's practice, his use of Christian speech, prevented him, as well as those influenced by him, from seeing that metaphysically his "god" was nothing other than a Jamesian sense that "there must be more."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=cGX4BOqc7P)
- ["Niebuhr's account of original sin is his attempt to do natural theology. Christians may not be able to convince agnostics and nonbelievers that God exists, but Christians can convince nonbelievers that sin exists. Moreover, if sin exists, it makes some sense to think that God exists. Niebuhr's project is to provide an account of the human condition that is so compelling that the more "absurd" aspects of "orthodox Christianity"-such as the beliefs that God exists and that God is love-might also receive a hearing."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=-LZpHthx8n)
- ["Like Feuerbach and Becker, then, Niebuhr identifies the contradiction between our finiteness and our freedom as the problem that underlies all religion."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Hm9wiGGhn-)
- ["Though the correspondence is not exact, it is not difficult to see that for Niebuhr the individual is to the group as spirit is to nature."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=T1ok7u0eX-)
- ["According to Harvey, the only difference between Feuerbach and Becker is that for Feuerbach religion is simply an illusion, whereas for Becker religious illusion is justified to the extent that it enables us to live with the terror of creatureliness."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=9SZhd_UdFD)
- ["In this account, the human being differs from other organisms by virtue of being an embodied consciousness. This defining characteristic creates what Becker considered the human dilemma: we are creatures destined to die, but was are cursed, as no other animal is, with the awareness that we will die. As conscious beings we possess a freedom that creates possibilities, but these possibilities cannot help but be frustrated by our knowledge that we will die. The roots of religion lie in this ontological structure. We are caught between the Promethean desire to flourish and the anxiety of the psyche in the face of necessity and death."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=UTBUbKyx4W)
- ["Niebuhr's theology seems to be a perfect exemplification of Ludwig Feuerbach's argument that theology, in spite of its pretentious presumption that its subject matter is God, is in fact but a disguised way to talk about humanity."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=DtTRQbGfvj)
- ["For Niebuhr, theology was tested - or, to use his language, validated - by its ability to provide provocative accounts of the human condition."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=teyvjphe3u)
- ["Like Troeltsch, he presumed that modern intellectual developments had rendered Christian beliefs unintelligible. Such beliefs, however, could be revived by plumbing them for their insights into the human condition. The truth of permanent myths, moreover, could be validated through a James-like empirical testing. Niebuhr's Gifford Lectures were his most sustained attempt to verify the Christian myth, which requires that we at once affirm the meaningfulness of life and accept the fact of evil. According to Niebuhr, this affirmation and acceptance require the recognition that God, who is love, can be found in this life only as the crucified."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=P1yGYdVoO2)
- ["Niebuhr assumed that he was a pragmatist opposing the Barthians, who asserted dogmatically the total truth of the biblical myth with no effort to validate Christianity in experience against the competition of other religions."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=dsJd08ZhW2)
- ["What Troeltsch provided Niebuhr was the ability to appropriate the "absurdities" of the Christian faith while avoiding literalist errors. Niebuhr's appropriation of Christianity on these terms involved recourse to the notion of "myth," and here again, Troeltsch was influential."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=y8U2a_6Bto)
- ["The animating center of Niebuhr's life and works was the crafting of an account of liberal Christianity acceptable to a liberal culture and politics."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=V_BXGndnxf)
- [Reinhold Niebuhr's life was a political life in which all convictions were tested in terms of their significance for sustaining the democratic enterprise."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=y11NCf9Jgt)

### - [ ] "I do not assume my account of modernity is necessarily one of declension. Though I admire and am attracted to many of the movements and figures we associate with what we call the Middle Ages, I do not assume the latter to be some golden age from which modernity names a fall. My reasons for not making the story of our time the story of "the fall" are theological. The gospel, the good news Christians have been given, the good news that we believe is embodied in the church, is not "at home" in this world. The assumption that the Middle Ages represents a time when Christians "got it right" not only does an injustice to the complexity of the times and places so named, but also betrays the gospel requirement that even in a world that understands itself to be Christian, faithful witness is no less required."

### - [ ] "James's Varieties. In that book, James gave voice to the haunting but unacknowledged sense that the human project no longer matters.Toward the end of _Varieties_, in what can be called only an extraordinary chapter in the history of human egoism just to the extent that the most primitive as well as the most sophisticated religions assure individuals that the divine meets them on the basis of their personal concerns. Yet according to James, the work of science utterly repudiates the personal point of view. Science records it laws and constructs its theories, ignoring their bearing on human fate...."

He cannot accomodate his processes to the convenience of individuals. The bubbles on the foam which coats a stormy sea are floating episodes, made and unmade by the forces of the wind and water. Our private selves are like those bubbles - epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe, ingeniously called them; their destinies weigh nothing and determine noting in the world's irremedial currents of events."

As the passage above suggests, James thought that after Darwin it was impossible to think that the world represented an orderly order. That we exist is an accident, and our ending will be equally accidental. Chance, not purpose, rules. Accordingly, science itself can no longer offer certainty and/or proof but only probable and persuasive explanations."

### - [ ] "What James means by "will" and "belief" must be understood as further specifications of his understanding that our life, insofar as it is governed, is shaped by passion-formed habits.

### - [ ] "Hilary Putnam gets it right when he characterizes James as a direct realist about perception, but not about conception.44 James's account of the will to believe was his attempt to develop the notion-represented by contemporary philosophers such as John McDowell, John Haldane, and Putnam-that conceptions are like capacities for representing rather than representations. "Will" was, I think, James's name for such capacities."

### - [ ] "James also refused to explain religion by trying to find its essential character in our fear of the unknown or in feelings of absolute dependence.  Rather, as I noted at the beginning of this lecture, personal religion for James was a "primordial thing" and was thus the source of all institutional forms that religion might take. In _The Will to Believe_, James had described religion as a belief in an unseen world. In _The Varieties of Religious Experience_, he elaborates and speaks of the "added dimension of emotion, this enthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so called can at best but bow its head and acquiesce. This sort of happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we find nowhere but in rcligion."

From this perspective, the emphasis on the "person" of Jesus is perverse because such an emphasis impedes the growth of the new universal religion of the human spirit. According to West, Emerson founded this new American religion, but James, in rising to its defense, became its first theologian."

Like Troeltsch his starting point was always human needs, human powers, human responsibilities. Christianity was a resource for man in the world, not a call for man to transcend the world.

Such beliefs, however, could be revived by plumbing them for their insights into the human condition. The truth of permanent myths, moreover, could be validated through a James-like empirical testing. Niebuhr's Gifford Lectures were his most sustained attempt to verify the Christian myth, which requires that we at once affirm the meaningfulness of life and accept the fact of evil. According to Niebuhr, this affirmation and acceptance require the recognition that God, who is love, can be found in this life only as the crucified."

- ["That Niebuhr's account of the human condition still seems persuasive to many is not surprising - for no matter how desiccated Niebuhr's account of Christianity may be, people formed by a liberal social order cannot even begin to imagine that they might accept the Christian faith on any other terms. Niebuhr's account of "original sin" is a comforting doctrine for a people so formed, because Niebuhr makes sin intelligible, a given of the human condition, without requiring a transformation of the self through the formation provided by the church-an odd position for a thinker who claims to be a pragmatist."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=8Y_59fOsoU)

Yet without an account of the church, Niebuhr has even less to offer Christians that [William] James does."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=k3zXRX4PsK)
- ["That is the heart of Niebuhr's ethics. Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized virtue of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance. Catholicism, the Renaissance, Calvinism, and the sectarian Protestants: Niebuhr judges them all to be mistaken attempts to make an ethic of sanctification a reality. These historical options, to be sure in quite different ways, result in a false attempt to make history conform to perfect love, or frustrated by the attempt, their adherents undertake an irresponsible withdrawal from the world."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=4s12KykKAO)

- ["But exactly because we are sinners we cannot and should not try to make the law of love a realized possibility in our relations with one another. Niebuhr acknowledges that Jesus' ethics of sacrificial love may be a possibility for relations between two individuals, but as soon as a third person is introduced into the relation, even "the most perfect love requires a rational estimate of conflicting needs and interests" (2:248) Accordingly, the cross - the symbol of sacrificial love - must stand on the edge of history acting as an indiscriminate norm that judges all our attempts to attain justice."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Cr4z7ytRR4)
- ["According to Niebuhr, the ultimate requirements of the Christian ethic-"love thy neighbor as thyself," "love the Lord thy God," and "be not anxious"-are not counsels of perfection that merely "top" natural goodness.

The end is prayer, which is simultaneously our posture and substance whenever we are fully human. Therefore, he cautions us against staking out theological positions more settled than prayer. The point is not to ensure we hold orthodox positions but to help us converse with God in faithful prayer.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=jdlfnEpjE9)

The Oxford Dictionary of English defines humanism as "a **rationalist outlook** or system of thought attaching **prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters**." Therefore, a humanist Christian is an objectively baptized Christian who is skeptical of supernaturalism, emphasizes an individual's essential human dignity, and seeks self-realization through the liberalism of reason.

### - Niebuhrian Christians struggle with the ambient anxieties of life and understand the Cross as an abstract symbol of the cruciform reality all humans face. Liberal reason equips them to endure their times of cross-bearing. They embrace Jesus as the name of the one who died so that God ultimately will accept them despite all the ways they've behaved unacceptably in this life. God is the name they give to the one who must exist for them to overcome their anxiety, the one who conquers chaos, creates order, and makes life turn out well in the end. 
- For Niebuhrian Christians, sin is the ancient name for the reminders that all of us miss the mark and that life only works if we forgive others and ourselves and that we ought not be surprised when others do grievous evil.

The sad experiences of Christian history show how human pride and spiritual arrogance rise to new heights precisely at the point where the claims of sanctity are made without due qualifications."

Yet without an account of the church, Niebuhr has even less to offer Christians that [William] James does."

### - [ ] Quoting T.F. Torrance, Hauerwas introduces Barth with Torrance's description of him as the "ultimate rationalist" just to the extent that he holds "to the basic point that reason is unconditionally bound and determined by it and that the nature of the object must prescribe the specific mode of the activity of reason. Faith is this reason directed to the knowledge of God, and involves a rational apprehension which answers appropriately to the object given. Here the object is unique and incomparable. What is expected of theology, therefore, is that it should exhibit the kind of rationality which corresponds with the unique object of thought."

### - [ ] "Barth never thought that theology was to be done for its own sake. Barth's discovery that the proper subject ject of theology is God went hand and hand with his understanding of the cultural challenge facing Christians. That challenge, which he thought was unavoidably manifest in World War I as well as in the rise of National Socialism in Germany, was nothing less than a recognition that our world has become quite literally godless. Christendom, even a Christendom as pale as that represented by Protestant liberalism, had replaced the Christian worship of God, and the result could not help but be dire."

### - [ ] "This understanding prepared Barth to recognize what few other Protestant theologians of his time were capable of seeing, namely, that Feuerbach was right. If faith is but the realization of an individual's spiritual life and self-awareness, if faith is but the capacity of the infinite in the finite, then faith as the Christian's tian's commerce with God can finally be no more than the Christian's commerce with herself. As a result, the truth of the gospel can be understood stood as an expression, a predicate, or a symbol of the Christian's inner experience. Barth argued that modern theology had accepted the Renaissance naissance discovery that humans are the measure of all things, which meant that "there was no effective answer to be given to Feuerbach who eagerly invoked Luther's sanction in support of his theory that statements ments of the Christian faith, like those of all other religions, are in reality ity statements of more or less profound human needs and desires projected jected into the infinite."

"Man has been called to present to the Creator the gratitude of the creation," Barth says, but this does not mean that there are not other beings who, perhaps in a more perfect way than human beings, present gratitude to the creator. Accordingly, Barth observes, serves, "we are certainly not always wrong, if we believe we hear a song of praise to God in the existence also of Sirius and the rock crystal, of the violet and the boa-constrictor."17 For Barth, we differ from the violet or the star only to the extent that our gratitude to God can take the form of knowledge and service."

After all, few people in the beginning diagnosed who Hitler was or what he stood for.

In other words, theology cannot begin with our questions; rather, theology begins as an act of faith and is, therefore, capable of giving ing "factual proof of the truth of our knowledge of God." For Barth, such "factual proof" requires that we refer to Jesus Christ, but references to Christ cannot be the last word, because in respect to the circulus veritatis Dci there is no last word...

As it turns out, such conceptual and moral skills are inseparable, since our ability to live lives appropriate to the God we worship cannot be divorced vorced from our ability to speak truthfully about and, more important, to pray to God. The Church Dogmatics, with its unending and confident display of Christian speech, is Barth's attempt to train us to be a people capable of truthful witness to the God who alone is the truth.

If Christians, in an effort to make our faith generally available, try to provide an account of creation abstracted from election in Christ, we will deceive not only those outside the faith, but, worse, ourselves.

To understand God in these terms is to understand that our lives are not fated, even if our judgments about reality, which are predicated on the indissoluble connection between our perceptions of self and world, make it appear as if, indeed, everything thing is subject to fate."

"Only in the illusion of sin," Barth says, can we suppose that our existence is ours, that our lives are reducible to our actions, and that everything else is fate. Revelation destroys this illusion because it alerts us to the fact that our existence is contingent on the One who is revealed as Trinity, that is, on the God whose being is action-and whose action is speech."

Confronting him, man is confronted by his creature, the neighbor, the fellow man who is God's child with him and hence his own brother. As he confronts God and is in covenant with him and responsible to him, not only atheism and religiosity and nostrification but also the inhumanity ity which in the world can compete so strangely with the knowledge of God, and therefore with humanity, can be no alternative for him. In his acts he simply cannot take part in the great vacillation between his being without or against his fellows and his being for them. It is thus most striking that he presents himself to other men of the world as a nonconformist, as one who is zealous for God's honor, as a witness to what he, who is also a man of the world, has to advocate to others of his kind. He does this by offering to them the image of a strangely human person."

The Christian ministry of witness, therefore, will disturb some people, and they will react to the pressure of the witness with **counterpressure**.

We shall say, "Jesus is Messiah and Lord"; but how do you say that in a pluralist/relativist language? If that language forbids us to say that, do we respect the prohibition? Or do we find a way to say it anyway? We won't play with the utopia of getting out of our own pluralist/relativist skins by going either backward or forward.

### - [ ] Hauerwas attributes to Yoder the insight that "relativism profoundly threatens two kinds of politics with correlative epistemologies that are or should be enemies of the church. Relativism threatens the epistemology of the establishment, which is validated by placing the power of political authority behind a particular belief system. Yoder notes that this epistemology is still normative among those who seek a monocultural unity in order to remove "subjective" choice from belief. Christians often have desired a peace conceived as 'unity,' but when we have done so we confuse the peace of Christ with worldly order, which, as Yoder points out, is exactly what happened when the church of Rome became the great Constantinian church." 
- [ ] "The other political and epistemological option that relativism threatens is the one that has underwritten the apologetic strategy of dominant Christianity and, in particular, mainstream Protestantism. Because the church perceives itself to lack political power, the search for some operation - linguistic, statistical, logical - is undertaken in an effort to secure a solid ground that will no longer be subject to the objections of others or to our own self-doubt. Such a strategy seeks to deny particularity. Yoder says, in the "vain effort to find assurance beyond the flux of unendingly meeting new worlds, or to create a metalanguage above the clash, in order to renew for tomorrow the trustworthiness and irrestistbility of the answers of the past." Reinhold Niebuhr's distinction between permanent and primitive myths is but one form of this mistaken strategy."
