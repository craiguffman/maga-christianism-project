### Highlights

- The crucial events took place during a period that Maclntyre locates roughly between 163o and 1850. It was then that "the project of an independent rational justification of morality" became and remained central not only to philosophy but "to Northern European culture" as well (AV 38). The end of the period is marked by Kierkegaard's decisive revelation that the project had failed. Kierkegaard shows us that no reason can be given for preferring the moral life to the aesthetic life: if one adopts either, one does so by making an arbitrary choice. But morality presents itself to us as that which claims our allegiance regardless of personal choice. So its authority cannot be explained by saying we just choose to be moral (AV 39-41). Kierkegaard was responding, Maclntyre says, to Kant, who was too sensitive to the distinctive claim of morality to try to found it on mere choice. Rejecting revealed religion and the pursuit of happiness as also unsuitable to ground morality, Kant tried to show that it springs fromreason alone. It was the complete failure of his effort to show how the contents of morality can be derived from such a base that forced Kierkegaard into his position (AV 42-5). And Kant, in turn, was responding to the challenge posed by Hume and Diderot. They tried to "found morality on the passions" (AV 47) and failed, as Kant saw. All four of these thinkers held a common view of the substance of morality, which they shared with their culture. Hence, the collapse of their efforts shows that "the project of providing a rational vindication of morality had decisively failed; and from henceforward the morality of our predecessor culture-and subsequently of our own-lacked any public, shared rationale or justification" (AV 48).

- We are not to suppose that this failure was a mere accident, that cleverer thinkers might have done a better job. The problem is intractable. It springs from the Enlightenment rejection of Aristotelianism in all its shapes. Briefly put, Maclntyre's analysis goes like this: On Aristotle's view, we humans have a telos, or goal, built into our nature. "Human" is therefore a function word, like "hammer." Function words pick out both physically identifiable characteristics of that to which they refer and criteria for the goodness of function of that sort of thing. Thus, the notion of "hammer" and that of "good hammer" are interdependent. And both the criteria identifying hammers physically and the criteria identifying their good functioning are, MacIntyre says, factual.

- Thus, in a culture, such as the Christian culture of the West, which accepts a fundamentally Aristotelian framework of thought, rational vindications of morality are available. Morality is to be understood in terms of three notions: "untutored human nature, man-as-he-could-be-if-he-realised-his-telos, and the moral precepts which enabled him to pass from one state to the other." Moral injunctions in a Christian culture say both what God ordains and what will lead to realizing the individual end. Since "the whole point of ethics ... is to enable man to pass from his present state to his true end," the… ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=864))
- the project of giving a rational basis to morality, as the Enlightenment understood it, arose because the teleological concept of human nature was dropped, along with the rest of Aristotle. The problem then was to find a new way of connecting the moral rules with human nature. But for two reasons this had become impossible. First, the moral injunctions inherited from the past were meant to be at odds with human nature as it initially is, so dropping the notion that human nature is meant to be something else leaves a code of rules radically unsuited for a human nature understood in no such way. Second, these now "incoherent fragments" cannot be given the kind of grounding they once had. Abandon the idea of essential human functions, Maclntyre says, and "it begins to appear implausible to treat moral judgments as factual statements." And if, as Enlightenment thinkers did, one gives up the idea that morality is a matter of God's commands or laws, the problem is made much worse. Hume's famous discovery of the impossibility of drawing a legitimate inference from factual premisses to a conclusion about what ought to be… ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=868))
- This "transition into modernity," Maclntyre says, "was a transition both in theory and in practice, and a single transition at that" (AV 58). The breakdown of the Enlightenment project in philosophical ethics gives expression to the collapse of the moral framework and so begins to explain the condition of morality in our own culture. Our interminable disputes arise because we cannot make rational sense of the "series of fragmented survivals from an older past" that constitutes our morality. Where an Aristotelian theory could relate rules and ends perfectly well, we cannot. The deontological aspect of morality is for us merely "the ghost of conceptions of divine law which are quite alien to the metaphysics of modernity." The teleological aspect is no better than a remnant of the abandoned Aristotelian belief in a human nature with a given end. Bentham, who saw the need for a new account of the teleological side of morality, failed to help the situation, because the way he tried to solve the problem-by appeal to the greatest happiness-involved a "notion without any clear content at all" (AV 62). The intuitionism that arose in opposition to utilitarianism as an effort to explain the deontological side of morality was actually the move that led toemotivism. For intuitionism in its practice, as opposed to its rhetoric, is in fact emotivist (AV 14-17, 63). And recent neo-Kantian attempts to ground morality must also be accounted complete failures, as witness the hopelessness of Gewirth's central argument (AV 64-5). Once we realize, however, that modern morality is… ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=876))
- My historical sketch was meant to raise doubts that Maclntyre's history, inspired by a virtue-centered theory, is more intelligible, or better, than one not so inspired. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=1040))
- Voluntarists as well as their critics agreed that we are to be guided by principles discoverable by reason. The critics, however, saw grave moral and political deficiencies in voluntarism. It was apt to corrupt character, and it had dangerous political implications. Theologians were not its only exponents. There were philosophers who made it their business to defend it; others, of course, tried to defeat it.The critics had a twofold task. They plainly had to replace the morality of voluntarism with a substantive morality that did not suffer from its alleged defects. Not surprisingly, different philosophers proposed different basic moral principles. But they agreed that voluntarism made it imperative to show that morality could be given a justifying foundation of a kind not previously claimed for it; and each tried to explain how his own substantive ethical theory could be given that sort ofjustification. The ethical theories most distinctive of modernity-utilitarianism, intuitionism, and Kantianism-were all initially proposed as ways of understanding morality that would defeat voluntarism. In ancient moral philosophy there are no counterparts to thesetheories because the normative issues that generated the modem concerns about principles and foundations had not been raised.

- The attacks on voluntarism thus illustrate an important point about the history of ethics. Modern thought about our moral convictions and about the psychology and metaphysics presupposed by them was profoundly shaped by moral and political concerns. Philosophers did not simply apply to morality the theoretical views they developed in response to problems posed by skepticism and the new science. Rather, substantive moral beliefs imposed conditions on theories of knowledge. The priority of morality to epistemology is central to much of the history of modern ethics. Nowhere is it more striking than in the development of theories concerning the epistemological foundations of morals.

- Voluntarism and Its FailingsFor an account of voluntarism we need look no further back than Luther.) "God is he," says Luther, "for whose will no cause or ground may be laid down as its rule and standard ... What God wills is not right because he ought or was bound so to will; on the contrary, what takes place must be right, because he so wills."2 Luther's view is part of his characteristically voluntarist belief that God is beyond human comprehension. We are here to obey his commands, not to understand his ways. Voluntarism also underlies Calvin's predestinarian view of God's incomprehensible distribution of grace. 3 During the seventeenth century several voluntarist theories about morality were put forward. The Catholic Suarez incorporated a significant element of voluntarism in his presentation of natural law. Descartes made much stronger voluntarist claims, asserting God's absolute power over the laws of morality as well as those of thought. Puritan theologians, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Locke all proposed different kinds of… ([Location 2525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=2525))
- A despotic ruler causes servility in his subjects, not love. But God must be loveable if the basic Christian moral commandment is to be one we can obey. Since mutual love between God and human beings is the source of love among humans, the voluntarist view would make a proper moral community impossible. God must be included in that community, because, as Leibniz put it, "God is not a kind of imaginary metaphysical being ... God is a definite substance, a person, a mind."7 We can avoid a loveless… ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=2545))
- In 1678 Cudworth charged that voluntarists "slander human nature and make a villain of it" in order the better to excuse political despotism.1' All anti-voluntarists strongly rejected what they took to be the voluntaristic moral denigration of human nature; and the fear that voluntarism had unacceptable political implications was never out of sight. The implications were plain in Hobbes. His mortal deity, the Leviathan, would be as untrammelled as the immortal one in legislating for selfish human beings. As late as 1765 Diderot underlined the link between Hobbes's political claims and his voluntarism. "All these ideas on the sovereignty and justice of God," Diderot says, "are the… ([Location 2550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=2550))
- The Need for New FoundationsIn Adam Smith's history of systems of morality in the last part of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Cudworth is identified as the originator of modern ethical rationalism. Cudworth attributed the origins of morality to reason, Smith says, in order to refute Hobbes; and it then became "the popular doctrine" that morality consists in conformity with reason.12 Popular or not, it is true that rationalist moral theorists from Cudworth on were typically opposed to voluntarism. It is also true that opponents of voluntarism all adopted central elements of rationalism in constructing their theories. William Law puts concisely the point they all want to make: "It is this rationality of our Nature that makes us ... obliged to practice… ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=2555))
- the antivoluntarists converge on three claims that their opponents reject.First, they agree that the basic moral principle or principles must assign a definite moral status to every action. If morality fails to cover every possible action, then God has scope for arbitrary choice; and it is against precisely this possibility that the anti-voluntarists wanted to guard. This is a new demand on a basic principle of ethics. Neither the classical theorists nor the mediaeval natural-law writers thought of morality as centering on principles of such power.Second, the critics all assert that the basic moral principle or principles must be necessarily true, and applicable to all moral agents. Contingent principles might hold only for us. But to assure moral community with God, in the next life as well as in this, we must know that he reasons from the same principles we do. Pufendorf's illustrations of his claim that Godand we stand under no common law make the difficulty here quite plain. No principle tied to contingent features of our lives would serve the critics' purpose. They were forced to appeal to the most general conceivable principles of morals. But the necessary and most general principles of a science must be self-evident. There is nothing from which they can be inferred. The anti-voluntarists consequently held that morality must rest on necessary and universal self-evident truths.Third, the opponents of voluntarism take an a priori position about moral motivation. God has none of our finite needs or desires. Hence he must be moved simply by his awareness of moral principle. Unless this is true, we cannot… ([Location 2562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004I8W3N2&location=2562))
- The question then was whether human beings exert their powers only in accordance with deterministic laws such as Newton's laws of motion. If active powers are always caused to act by something outside themselves, then their possessors are not truly originators of their actions.8 How then can they be capable of moral responsibility or possess any more dignity than stones or trees or horses? Newtonian science seemed to make a Cartesian will just as unthinkable as Malebranchean metaphysics did. Eighteenth-century inquiry about the domain of the will was framed by the question of whether between God and nature there is any conceptual room for powers in the human mind that make our agency different in kind from that of natural objects.
