# Theological Contrasts: Traditional Christianity and MAGA Christianism

This document outlines key theological distinctions between traditional orthodox Christianity across denominational lines and the phenomenon of MAGA Christianism. These contrasts serve as analytical frameworks for examining how MAGA Christianism represents a departure from historic Christian theology and practice.

## Understandings of Salvation

### Traditional Christianity
- **Participatory Faith**: Emphasizes salvation as participation in Christ's life, death, and resurrection
- Understands faith as transformative relationship rather than mere intellectual assent
- Balances individual salvation with communal dimensions of faith
- Views justification within broader context of reconciliation with God and others
- Emphasizes ongoing sanctification and character formation

### MAGA Christianism
- **Transactional Faith**: Tends toward individualistic understanding of salvation
- Often reduces faith to verbal profession or political allegiance
- Emphasizes justification theory in ways that can diminish ethical implications
- Frequently prioritizes cultural markers of Christian identity over spiritual formation
- Tends to conflate religious and political conversion/commitment

## Conceptions of Divine Power

### Traditional Christianity
- **Being With**: God's power primarily expressed through presence, solidarity, and love
- The cross reveals God's power operating through apparent weakness

- Views the church as witnessing to Christ's kingdom through faithful presence

### MAGA Christianism
- **Working For**: Emphasizes God's power as dominance and control
- Tends to seek evidence of divine blessing in worldly success and influence
- Often embraces "strong man" leadership models in both church and society
- Frequently views divine sovereignty as deterministic
- Seeks to advance God's kingdom through acquisition of political power

## Means and Ends in Christian Ethics
