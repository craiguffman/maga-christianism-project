# Synthesis Notes: Tolerance Among the Virtues for MAGA Christianism Project

## Overview

John Bowlin's "Tolerance Among the Virtues" provides a robust philosophical and theological framework for understanding tolerance as a moral virtue, which has direct relevance to our critique of MAGA Christianism. The book develops an account of tolerance that acknowledges it as a natural virtue related to justice, explores its relationship to forbearance, and explains how these virtues help us maintain social relationships across lines of significant moral disagreement.

## Key Connections to MAGA Christianism Critique

### Tolerance as a Virtue, Not a Vice

Bowlin's core thesis directly challenges the MAGA Christianist view that tolerance is a form of moral weakness or relativism:

"Intolerance is a vice. Its act wrongs another person. It denies them a good they are due." This challenges the narrative that refusing to tolerate differences is a form of moral strength or clarity.

This will be particularly useful for the "Binary Apocalypticism" section, where we need to counter the friend/enemy distinctions that characterize MAGA Christianity's approach to social and political differences.

### The Moral Substance of Tolerance

Bowlin defines tolerance as "a moral virtue... annexed to justice as one of its parts." This characterization counters the common criticism that tolerance represents moral collapse or indifference. Instead, it's a virtue that "perfects our capacity to act in certain ways in accord with certain norms and reasons."

This understanding helps address the "Practical Atheism" mutation in our outline, showing how tolerance properly understood is not just pragmatic compromise but virtuous action.

### Forms of False Tolerance

Bowlin distinguishes true tolerance from several imposters:
- "Ordinary toleration" - which regards social peace as a private good
- Indifference - which abandons moral judgment
- Acceptance - which eliminates objection

This analysis helps us distinguish between genuine tolerance and the "pale theism" of Niebuhrian realism that has influenced many Christian approaches to politics.

### The Limits of Tolerance

Importantly, Bowlin argues that tolerance has proper limits: "Not all differences are in fact objectionable and thus cannot be treated as proper objects of the patient endurance that we typically associate with tolerance."

This helps us counter the claim that Christian tolerance necessarily means abandoning moral judgment. As he notes, "some differences cannot be considered objectionable and thus cannot be treated as proper objects of the patient endurance that we typically associate with tolerance."

### Tolerance, Forbearance and Christian Love

Bowlin provides a crucial distinction between tolerance as a natural virtue and forbearance as Christian love's response to objectionable difference:

"As habit and act, forbearance is as different from tolerance as love is from justice." 

This gives us a theological framework for the "Third Way: Christian Humanism" section, showing how Christian love transcends yet incorporates the civil virtue of tolerance.

## Application to Specific Book Chapters

### For "First Mutation - Primitive Biblicism"

Bowlin's account of how tradition and community are necessary for moral formation provides a counterpoint to the primitive biblicist claim that Scripture alone is sufficient:

"MacIntyre's understanding of tradition lies at the heart of his moral and epistemological theory. For MacIntyre, the narrative of an individual's life is to be understood against the background of the wider social context within which that individual finds herself."

The claim that moral concepts require a community of judgment helps counter the primitive biblicist assertion that Scripture provides unmediated access to moral truth.

### For "Second Mutation - Practical Atheism"

Bowlin's discussion of the relationship between tolerance and concrete moral judgments challenges the utilitarian pragmatism of Practical Atheism:

"If one mistakes a semblance for a virtue, and if one assumes that the semblance exhausts what the virtue might be and distinguishes the age one happens to inhabit, then, chances are, one will consider that age corrupt, its virtues bankrupt."

This helps explain how MAGA Christianism collapses genuine Christian virtues into a kind of instrumental pragmatism.

### For "Third Mutation - Binary Apocalypticism"

Bowlin's account of tolerance's relationship to autonomy directly challenges the binary thinking of apocalyptic politics:

"Tolerance quite obviously regards tolerable differences, but this is to say that its patient endurance bears on those actions and things that land between the indifferent and the acceptable, not that these actions and things are always insubstantial."

His discussion of how tolerance and forbearance maintain social relationships across lines of disagreement provides an alternative to the friend/enemy distinctions of MAGA Christianity:

"Tolerance and its act, I have said, will assist its emergence. Strip away coercion and manipulation, bracket circumstances where choice is impossible because necessity rules, assume a basic level of intellectual and physical prowess, cultivate reflectiveness about the relative goodness of the available options, and the capacity to act autonomously will emerge."

## Theological Framework

Bowlin's theological analysis of forbearance as "love's endurance" provides a powerful framework for thinking about a Christian alternative to MAGA binaries:

"It is the Apostle Paul who spoke most vividly and famously of a love that endures all things (1 Cor 13:7), and Christians will refer to a species of this act and its attendant virtue that come by God's grace and that abides within friendships animated by God's love."

This connects to our "Third Way: Christian Humanism" section, showing how Christian love transcends yet incorporates the civil virtue of tolerance.

## Conclusion

Bowlin's account of tolerance helps us understand MAGA Christianism's rejection of tolerance not as moral strength but as a vice of intolerance. By distinguishing true tolerance from its semblances, he provides a framework for articulating a Christian response to difference that neither gives in to relativism nor resorts to binary friend/enemy distinctions.

His attention to tolerance's relationship to justice and forbearance's relationship to love provides theological resources for the "Third Way: Christian Humanism" that our book project aims to articulate.
