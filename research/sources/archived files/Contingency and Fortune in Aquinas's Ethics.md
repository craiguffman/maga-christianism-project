### Highlights

- the most prominent among the anti-consequentialist rescuers -John Finnis, Germain Grisez, and Joseph Boyle - concede that Aquinas's treatment of the natural law must be supplemented with Kantian arguments, alien to Aquinas, in order to advance an account of the moral life that the critics consider stereotypically Thomistic. Defending Aquinas against his defenders, Finnis, Grisez, and Boyle insist they can succeed only as they regard his own treatment of the moral life as inchoate and incomplete Kantian rationalism, thus inadvertently perpetuating the erroneous image.

- Much of the confusion here follows from the inordinate attention all parties give to Aquinas's remarks about the natural law in the prima secundae of the Summa Theologiae. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=77))
- Once again the irony is obvious. Interpreters who regard the treatise on law as the main event have in fact been concentrating on a side show. They contend that Aquinas's treatment of the natural law deserves our careful consideration, and yet our… ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=88))

- others give special attention to Aquinas's remarks about the natural law in order to muster critical leverage against certain social and political arrangements in the modern period. Dissatisfied with this or that aspect of modern life, dismayed by institutions and practices that refuse to provide moral guidance, and appalled by the inability of modern moral philosophy to offer stable foundations and compelling warrants for those institutions and practices that deserve to be sustained, friends on both the left and the right look to Aquinas for aid, hoping his appeal to nature can yield the prohibitions and prescriptions that these troubled times need. Still, it is not at all clear that Aquinas's remarks about the first precepts of the natural law can bear this burden, largely because (as I shall argue in chapter three) he has something else in mind as he… ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=94))

- Every effort to understand Aquinas's account of the moral life will begin with assumptions of this kind. Let me make mine plain. I do not believe that doubts about the content of our most basic moral obligations should motivate our inquiries into the character of the moral life. Nor should doubts about the warrants that justify acting in accord with the basic obligations we do accept. Why? Because in each instance the doubt is more apparent than real. I am not suggesting that skepticism is unimaginable here. Nor am I implying that there is perfect agreement among us about the content of obligation. However, I am convinced that skepticism about fundamental moral matters is not a real option, atleast not for most of us. For the most part, we do not need to be told what our most basic obligations are or how they are justified. Most of us consider moral guidance of this kind unnecessary, if not insulting, and most of us regard with suspicion those whose doubts about obligation are such that they welcome the aid that… ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=110))

- By contrast, we can be genuinely confused about what our basic obligations require of us in concrete circumstances. Basic obligation aside, we can be puzzled about the character of the good and the best in some particular instance. Knowing it is… ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=118))

- His reply can be put simply. The good is difficult to know in particular, and difficult to will even when it is known, because of contingencies of various kinds, within ourselves and in the circumstances of choice. It follows that the moral life described in the secunda pars receives much of its character and content from the ability of the virtues to confront thesecontingencies." By "moral life" I mean what Aquinas does (STi-ii. i.3): the life of human action, its causes, both intrinsic (intellect, will, and virtue) and extrinsic (law and grace),… ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=126))

- It follows that Aquinas's treatment of the moral virtues is largely functional. Their significance, he insists, lies in their ability to cope with those contingencies that hinder our achievement of the good and the best. Indeed, above all, the virtues work. This is what they do, this is what distinguishes them, and this, according to Aquinas, is why we praise them. Their intelligibility and their goodness follow from their efforts, and their efforts are needed precisely because our pursuit of the good is hounded on all sides by contingencies of all kinds, difficulties… ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=132))

- Both Aristotle's remarks (Int.18a34-18b16) and Aquinas's commentary indicate that what is at stake here is the character of the concepts and the relations among them, with defeatability and frequency setting the terms of each. The causes of necessary events cannot be defeated and thus always produce their effects. The causes of contingent events can be defeated. Disruptions by chance or fortune can prevent them from producing… ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=149))

- The argument turns on an assumption about causation. Both Aristotle and Aquinas insist that when we ask for the cause of a thing we are asking for reasons that explain its occurrence and character (Ph. 194b16- 195a26; In Phys.11.5.176-181)." In fact, both contend that causation has more to do with rational explanation than with constant conjunction, antecedent necessitating conditions, or exceptionless regularity. Aristotle's phrasing captures it best. Understanding the primary cause of a thing is equivalent to "grasping the `… ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=158))

- With Aquinas in step (In Metaph.vi.3.1201; In Pe?ih.i. 14. 11; ST i. 115.6), Aristotle concludes (Metaph.1o27b12-14) that it is a mistake to say that all things that happen have a cause. Fortuitous happenings do not. Our meeting in the market did not, and thus the world is not as the Stoics imagine. It is not an uninterrupted causal nexus. Causes produce effects that converge for no reason and when they do the web of causal connections is broken. It follows that a cause located, even a sufficient cause, does not necessarily yield its… ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=165))

- Aquinas distinguishes chance and fortune as Aristotle does (Ph.196bio-i98a12). A chance event is any happening that affects the character of something else by accident. A fortuitous event… ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=173))

- God does not know as we do, as a creature in time, but rather as the eternal Creator who transcends time. As such, all things that have been and will be are simultaneously present to God all at once, in one simple intuition (In Perih.1.14.20). From this angle of vision contingent things are known, not successively according to their mode of being, but simultaneously according to the mode of the eternal knower (ST 1.14.13). As such, it is misleading to speak of God knowing the contingent future, for God does not know in this historical mode. There are no future events that can be foreknown from God's perspective, just as there are no past events to remember. It follows that we cannot fear that God's knowledge of the future fixes its character.… ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=190))

- Happily, we need not solve this philosophical debate before exegesis can proceed.20 All we need is evidence that Aquinas thinks he has good reason to find contingency, chance, and fortune in creation. With that in hand we can ignore those who say that fortune can have no place in Aquinas's account of the moral life, and we can ask whether he in fact develops his… ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E95XI0&location=213))

- The answer I wish to defend is this: Aquinas considers the human good contingent, and it is this contingency, this difficulty, that the prudent and the just must address if they are to avoid moral failure and will true goods with constancy. By the contingency of the good I mean the contingent goodness of the will's objects, both the end of the interior act of the will and the object of the exterior act, or the means (STi-ii.18.6). Moreover, I mean to imply that they are contingent as passions can be: their goodness for us can change as fortune does, haphazardly, unexpectedly, and independent of our bidding.

- The point of significance here is that natural law moral criticism in Aquinas's hands can proceed only when the corrupted nature that causes the unnatural act has voluntary origins. Without those origins there can be no moral substance to the charge that the action is against nature, for in that event no action has been done, no step taken into the moral, which, strictly speaking, regards human action simply (ST I-II.1.3). But this means that blameworthy unnatural actions have ultimate causes that are natural, precisely because natural action in this basic sense is nothing more than action that is rational in the most minimal sense and thus sufficiently voluntary to warrant blame.
