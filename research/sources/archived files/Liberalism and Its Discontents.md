### Highlights

- Beginning in the late 1970s, economic liberalism evolved into what is now labeled neoliberalism, which dramatically increased economic inequality and brought on devastating financial crises that hurt ordinary people far more than wealthy elites in many countries around the globe.

- On the left, there are demands for a massive redistribution of wealth and power, as well as recognition of groups rather than individuals based on fixed characteristics such as race and gender, as well as policies to equalize outcomes between them. Since none of this is likely to happen on the basis of a broad social consensus, progressives are happy to continue to make use of courts, executive agencies, and their substantial social and cultural power to further this agenda.

- These threats to liberalism are not symmetrical. The one coming from the right is more immediate and political; the one on the left is primarily cultural and therefore slower-acting. Both are driven by discontents with liberalism that do not have to do with the essence of the doctrine, but rather with the way in which certain sound liberal ideas have been interpreted and pushed to extremes. The answer to these discontents is not to abandon liberalism as such, but to moderate it. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=76))

- Chapters 4 and 5 will examine how the basic liberal principle of personal autonomy was absolutized, and turned into a critique of the individualism and the universalism on which liberalism rested. Chapter 6 deals with the critique of modern natural science that was pioneered on the progressive left but soon spread to the populist right, while chapter 7 describes how modern technology has challenged the liberal principle of free speech.

- Liberal societies confer rights on individuals, the most fundamental of which is the right to autonomy, that is, the ability to make choices with regard to speech, association, belief, and ultimately political life. Included within the sphere of autonomy is the right to own property and to undertake economic transactions. Over time, autonomy would also come to include the right to a share of political power through the right to vote. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=134))
- The tension between theory and practice drove, as well as the grass-roots mobilization of excluded groups, the evolution of liberal regimes towards a broader and more inclusive recognition of human equality. In this manner, liberalism differed sharply from nationalist or religiously based doctrines that explicitly limited rights to certain races, ethnicities, genders, confessions, castes, or status groups. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=142))
- Democracy refers to rule by the people, which today is institutionalized in periodic free and fair multiparty elections under universal adult suffrage. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=150))

- Liberalism in the sense I am using it refers to the rule of law, a system of formal rules that restrict the powers of the executive, even if that executive is democratically legitimated through an election. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=151))

- There have been three essential justifications for liberal societies put forward over the centuries. The first is a pragmatic rationale: liberalism is a way of regulating violence and allowing diverse populations to live peacefully with one another. The second is moral: liberalism protects basic human dignity, and in particular human autonomy—the ability of each individual to make choices. The final justification is economic: liberalism promotes economic growth and all the good things that come from growth, by protecting property rights and the freedom to transact. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=178))

- Liberalism has a strong association with certain forms of cognition, particularly the scientific method, which is seen as the best means of understanding and manipulating the external world. Individuals are assumed to be the best judges of their own interests, and are able to take in and test empirical information about the outside world in the making of those judgments. While judgments will necessarily vary, there is a liberal belief that in a free marketplace of ideas, good ideas will in the end drive out bad ones through deliberation and evidence. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=182))
- Liberalism sought to lower the aspirations of politics, not as a means of seeking the good life as defined by religion, but rather as a way of ensuring life itself, that is, peace and security. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=196))
- The fear of violent death was, according to him, the most powerful passion, one that was universally shared by human beings in a way that religious beliefs were not. Therefore the first duty of the state was to protect the right to life. This was the distant origin of the phrase “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” in the US Declaration of Independence. Building on this foundation, John Locke observed that life could also be threatened by a tyrannical state, and that the state itself needed to be constrained by the “consent of the governed.” ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=199))
- Classical liberalism can therefore be understood as an institutional solution to the problem of governing over diversity, or, to put it in slightly different terms, of peacefully managing diversity in pluralistic societies. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=204))

- The most fundamental principle enshrined in liberalism is one of tolerance: you do not have to agree with your fellow citizens about the most important things, but only that each individual should get to decide what they are without interference from you or from the state. Liberalism lowers the temperature of politics by taking questions of final ends off the table: you can believe what you want, but you must do so in private life and not seek to impose your views on your fellow citizens. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=205))
- a significant part of a society does not accept liberal principles themselves and seeks to restrict the fundamental rights of other people, or when citizens resort to violence to get their way, then liberalism is not sufficient to maintain political order. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=209))
- Diversity can take many forms: ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=215))

- The second justification for a liberal society is a moral one: a liberal society protects human dignity by granting citizens an equal right to autonomy. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=226))

- Liberalism has thus become tied to democracy, which can be seen as an expression of collective autonomy. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=232))

([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=236))
- century.6 The third major justification for liberalism had to do with its connection to economic growth and modernization. For many nineteenth-century liberals, the most important form of autonomy was the ability to buy, sell, and invest freely in a market economy. Property rights were central to the liberal agenda, along with contract enforcement through institutions that lowered the risk of trade and investment with strangers. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=246))

- there has been a strong historical association between liberalism and freedom of commerce. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=259))
- Property rights were among the initial rights to be guaranteed by rising liberal regimes, well before the right to associate or vote. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=260))

- The central place of property rights in liberal theory meant that the strongest advocates of liberalism tended to be the new middle classes that were the by-product of economic modernization—what Karl Marx would call the bourgeoisie.

- James Madison argued in his “Address at the Virginia Convention” that “the rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted.” ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=274))
- The Revolution spawned the next major competitor to liberalism, which was nationalism. Nationalists argued that political jurisdictions should correspond to cultural units, defined largely by language and ethnicity. They rejected liberalism’s universalism, and sought to confer rights primarily on their favored group. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=288))
- Europeans saw the folly of organizing politics around an exclusive and aggressive understanding of nation, ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=294))
- The other major competitor to liberalism was communism. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=304))
- But, as Madison observed, liberalism does not lead to an equality of outcomes, and from the French Revolution onwards there were strong tensions between liberals committed to the protection of property rights, and a left that sought redistribution of wealth and income through a strong state. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=305))
- the more radical proponents of democratic equality organized under the banner of Marxism–Leninism, and were willing to abandon liberal rule of law altogether and vest power in a dictatorial state. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=308))
- There is a large literature explaining how the countries of East Asia never adopted anything like the full-blown form of market capitalism that existed in the United States—indeed, European capitalism looked very different as well.9 In East Asia and in Europe, the state remained a much more important actor in encouraging economic growth than in the United States. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=334))
- One of liberalism’s core ideas is its valorization and protection of individual autonomy. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=343))
- On the right, autonomy meant primarily the right to buy and sell freely, without interference from the state. Pushing this notion to extremes, economic liberalism turned into “neoliberalism” in the late twentieth century and led to grotesque inequalities, which is the subject of the following two chapters. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=344))
- On the left, autonomy meant personal autonomy with regard to lifestyle choices and values, and resistance to the social norms imposed by the surrounding society. Pushed down this road, liberalism began to erode its own premise of tolerance as it evolved into modern identity politics. These extreme versions of liberalism then generated a backlash, which is the source of the right-wing populist and left-wing progressive movements that threaten liberalism today. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=346))

- Neoliberalism is often used today as a pejorative synonym for capitalism, but it should more properly be used in a narrower sense to describe a school of economic thought, often associated with the University of Chicago or the Austrian School, and economists like Milton Friedman, Gary Becker, George Stigler, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek, who sharply denigrated the role of the state in the economy, and emphasized free markets as spurs to growth and efficient allocators of resources. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=354))
- On a more popular level, neoliberalism was allied to what Americans label libertarianism, whose single underlying theme is hostility to an overreaching state and belief in the sanctity of individual freedom. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=363))
- But their belief in the primacy of individual freedom led them to oppose state action in social matters as well. They were highly critical of the large and seemingly ever-expanding welfare states that had been created in most liberal democracies over the decades, and disapproved of state efforts to regulate personal behaviors like drug use and sexuality. Some libertarians believed it was simply up to individuals to take care of themselves. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=366))
- By the 1970s, the pendulum had swung over to excessive state control. Many sectors of the economies of the United States and Europe were overregulated, and generous commitments to social welfare systems left many rich countries facing exploding debt loads. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=381))

- The cure for these problems undertaken by international financial institutions was that prescribed by the Chicago School: fiscal austerity, flexible exchange rates, deregulation, privatization, and strict control over domestic money supplies. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=387))
- But the neoliberal agenda was pushed to a counterproductive extreme. A valid insight into the superior efficiency of markets evolved into something of a religion, in which state intervention was opposed as a matter of principle. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=394))

- Even as it promoted two decades of rapid economic growth, neoliberalism succeeded in destabilizing the global economy and undermining its own success. Deregulation was helpful in many sectors of the real economy, but proved disastrous when it was applied in the 1980s and 1990s to the financial sector. Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan and other economists at the time believed that the latter would be able to regulate itself. But financial institutions behave very differently from firms in the real economy. Unlike a manufacturing corporation, a large investment bank is systemically dangerous, and can impose huge costs on the economy as a whole if it takes excessive risks. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=405))
- Neoliberalism had problematic consequences in its support of free trade. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=422))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- The basic doctrine is correct: countries that lower trade barriers with one another will see markets and efficiency expand, leading to higher aggregate incomes for all parties concerned. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=423))
- Those same trade theorists would, however, have also explained, sotto voce, that not every individual in every country will benefit from free trade. In particular, low-skilled workers in rich countries are likely to lose jobs and opportunities to similarly skilled workers in poor countries as multinational corporations offshore their facilities. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=425))
- Many neoliberals supported open immigration, again on the grounds that allowing labor to move to the point of greatest demand would lead to better efficiency. They were again correct in thinking that labor mobility would improve aggregate welfare, but paid less attention to its distributional consequences and the social backlash it would inspire. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=431))
- few voters think in terms of aggregate wealth. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=434))
- Once again, they began with a correct initial premise: government programs that seek to help people through difficult times frequently create moral hazard. That is, they encourage more of the behavior whose effects they were meant to mitigate. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=440))
- a prolonged period in which neoliberal reformers sought to cut back state sectors by ending or scaling back social programs, firing bureaucrats, or seeking to offload programs on to private sector contractors or civil society organizations. In the United States, this effort culminated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which ended AFDC altogether and shifted its funding into block grants to states. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=448))
- The idea of “personal responsibility” is a liberal concept that is built around a true insight, but one that has been carried to extremes by neoliberals. Moral hazard is a reality: if the state pays people not to work, they will work less; if it insures people against too many risks (like building homes in floodplains or in woodland areas of high fire risk), then they will take unwise risks. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=454))
- But neoliberals and some old-fashioned classical liberals have periodically carried this idea to disastrous extremes. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=458))
- Liberalism properly understood is compatible with a wide range of social protections provided by the state. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=464))
- When a person loses a job due to a raging pandemic, temporary government assistance is not fostering dependence, nor is universal access to health care going to make people lazy and improvident. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=467))
- A basic principle of liberalism should be that individuals are expected to be responsible for their own happiness and life outcomes, but that the state is fully justified in stepping in to support them when they are subject to adverse circumstances beyond their control.

- Another branch of neoliberal economic theory that is intrinsically questionable and has led to some very problematic political consequences had to do with the enthroning of consumer welfare as the ultimate measure of economic well-being, and the implications this choice has had for policy domains like antitrust and trade. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=528))

- The legal scholar and later Solicitor General Robert Bork argued that antitrust law should have one, and only one, goal, which was to maximize consumer welfare, understood either in terms of prices or quality.

There is a deeper philosophical issue underlying this policy question, which is whether human beings are simply consuming animals whose well-being is measured by how much they consume, or producing animals whose happiness depends on their ability to shape nature and exercise their creative faculties. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=560))
- The philosopher Hegel argued that human autonomy rested in work and the ability to transform given nature; that was what in the modern world gave dignity to the slave and made the slave an equal of the master. Karl Marx inherited this idea from Hegel, and said that human beings were both consuming and producing animals. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=564))
- Communist societies tended to value production over consumption to bad effect: they had “heroes of socialist labor” but no food on the shelves in their stores. The rise of neoliberalism has shifted the pendulum far over to the other side. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=567))
- emerged through the random evolutionary interaction of atoms and molecules ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=584))
- Complexity theory, elaborated at places like the Santa Fe Institute, sought to formalize the idea of self-organization and produced genuine insights about how order often originated in a decentralized manner, from flocking birds to indigenous communities agreeing to share resources without the benefit of governments. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=595))
- Both Hayek and the techno-libertarians were hostile to the state, which they felt frequently got in the way of human self-organization. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=599))
- successfully at all. So ideas about the centrality of property rights, consumer welfare, and spontaneous order are far more ambiguous in their economic, political, and moral consequences than neoliberal doctrine would suggest. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=606))
- Modern economics is built around an assumption that human beings are “rational utility maximizers,” meaning that they use their considerable cognitive skills to maximize their individual self-interest.* ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=610))
- the assumption that human beings act first and foremost as individuals. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=619))
- While human beings often act as selfish individuals, they are also intensely social creatures who cannot be individually happy without the support and recognition provided by their peers. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=633))
- The human “utility function” therefore includes a lot more than material preferences. Human beings also crave respect, the intersubjective recognition that other humans provide about one’s worth or dignity. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=640))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Moreover, human beings crave respect not just for themselves, but also for external things like religious beliefs, social rules, and traditions, even when such craving leads them to behavior that is individually costly. This means that human beings cannot “maximize” in the manner suggested by the basic economic model, which assumes that people have stable preferences. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=647))
- This is the essence of human autonomy: people constantly make choices between material self-interest and intangible goods like respect, pride, principle, and solidarity, and in ways that cannot be accommodated by the basic utility maximization model. This is particularly true in organizations, where behavior typically conforms to expectations set by peers rather than by any simple calculation of individual self-interest. If human beings were simple maximizing machines, they would never serve in combat or even take the time to vote. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=651))
- Liberal individualism does not preclude or deny human sociability; it simply means that most social engagements in a liberal society will ideally be voluntary. You can join with other people, but what groups you join are, to the maximum extent possible, a matter of personal choice. This is what creates the civil society we see around us. The core promise of liberalism to protect individual choice remains intensely desired by modern people, not just people in the West where liberalism and individualism were born, but now across the planet in every society that is in the process of modernizing. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=676))
- problem with neoliberalism in economics was thus not that it began from false premises. Its premises were often correct; they were simply incomplete and often historically contingent. The doctrine’s defect was to carry those premises to an extreme where property rights and consumer welfare were worshipped, and all aspects of state action and social solidarity denigrated.

- democracy by creating excessive inequality and financial instability, liberalism on the left evolved into modern identity politics, versions of which then began to undermine the premises of liberalism itself.

- There is a parallel between the shift from economic liberalism to neoliberalism, and the evolution of Lockean-Jeffersonian liberalism to the Rawlsian version. In both cases, a strong underlying idea (the benefits of free markets in one case, the value of individual autonomy in the other) was stretched to an unsustainable extreme. In the case of Rawls, the problem lies in the absolutization of autonomy, and the elevation of choice over all other human goods. This absolutization is both theoretically objectionable, and has played itself out in problematic ways in liberal societies.

- Had the two individuals in my example differed in terms of race, national origin, or religious heritage, then Rawls would be correct that a liberal state could not discriminate between them since these are characteristics over which they had no control. But where they differ is with regard to their character: the degree to which they are public-spirited, generous, thoughtful, meaningfully connected to the people around them, courageous, well-informed, and interested in improving themselves through education. Character is something that can be deliberately cultivated by individuals, an important part of their autonomy.

- The elevation of self-actualization could be seen as a contemporary manifestation of Rousseau’s inner self, the authentic being that was being smothered and suppressed by social regulation. The social psychologist Abraham Maslow put self-actualization at the apex of human needs, above more pedestrian concerns like family or social solidarity.10 In doing so, he was supported by a new and rapidly growing infrastructure of therapeutic psychologists, who had increasingly displaced the pastor or parish priest as the source of social solace for people who were troubled or alienated. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=847))
- The desire for self-actualization did not disappear; it was simply diverted from politics and overt countercultural activism into something more deeply personal. Tara Isabella Burton describes this transformation as “remixed religion,” where conformity with institutional religion was replaced by “intuitional” religion that could be assembled from any number of pieces as a matter of individual choice.12 Many Americans supplemented or simply replaced Christianity with a variety of Eastern religions like Hinduism or Buddhism, which provided them with a pathway to spirituality that seemed blocked by mainline churches. Millions of other people began to practice watered-down versions of Hinduism in the form of yoga and meditation, which directly focused attention on the recovery of the inner self. They believed they were doing this in search of exercise or mental health, while unconsciously buying into the idea that recovery of their deeply hidden self would be their ultimate source of happiness.

- People of course need to care for their bodies, but “wellness” took on a spiritual meaning for many Americans, ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=877))
- The self-care and wellness movements are simply contemporary manifestations of Rousseau’s vision of the “plenitude” of the inner self. That self is good, and its recovery is the original fount of human happiness. But it has been polluted by an outer society that feeds us unhealthy foods full of pesticides and artificial flavors, that sets goals and expectations that build anxiety and self-doubt, and by competitive urges that undermine our self-esteem. Instead of worshipping God, we need to worship ourselves, a self that is hidden by doubts and uncertainty, just as God was once hidden from Martin Luther. Rather than seeking the false esteem of others, we need to esteem ourselves. This is what ultimately gives us agency and control over our lives.

- While very few people in contemporary liberal societies have read Rawls, his views have filtered down into the popular culture in many ways, and into the American legal system. We believe we have inner selves whose freedom is being restricted by a host of existing institutions, from family to workplaces to political authorities. In many quarters, dissidence is celebrated, and it is being judgmental that is condemned. Freedom to choose extends not just to the freedom to act within established moral frameworks, but to choose the framework itself.

- Sugar and cotton grown by slaves did play a role in the economic development of Britain and the United States.

- There are thus two versions of modern identity politics. One version sees the drive for identity as the completion of liberal politics: historically dominant elites fail to appreciate the specific struggles of marginalized groups, and therefore fail to recognize their underlying common humanity.

- There are two normative principles undergirding freedom of speech in a liberal society. The first has to do with the need to avoid artificial concentrations of power over speech.

Rather, they begin with strong preferences for the reality they prefer, and use their considerable cognitive skills to select empirical data and devise theories that support that reality in a process labeled “motivated reasoning.” ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=1427))

- The territorial jurisdiction of a state necessarily corresponds to the area occupied by the group of individuals who signed on to the social contract. People living outside that jurisdiction must have their rights respected, but not necessarily enforced by that state.

- Nations are important not just because they are the locus of legitimate power and instruments for controlling violence. They are also a singular source of community. Liberal universalism at one level flies in the face of the nature of human sociability. We feel the strongest bonds of affection for those closest to us, such as friends and family; as the circle of acquaintance widens, our sense of obligation inevitably attenuates. As human societies have grown larger and more complex over the centuries, the boundaries of solidarity have expanded dramatically from families and villages and tribes to entire nations. ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=1790))
- if national identity is based on fixed characteristics like race, ethnicity, or religious heritage, then it becomes a potentially exclusionary category that violates the liberal principle of equal dignity. So while there is no necessary contradiction between the need for national identity and for liberal universalism, there is nonetheless a powerful potential point of tension between the two principles. Under these conditions, national identity can turn into aggressive and exclusive nationalism, as it did in Europe during the first part of the twentieth century.

- National identity is a social construct, and it can be shaped to support rather than undermine liberal values.

- I have argued elsewhere that American institutions have decayed over time, becoming rigid and hard to reform, and are suffering from capture by elites. When its complex constitutional structure of checks and balances has combined with growing political polarization, its institutions have become gridlocked and have failed to confront many basic governing tasks like passing yearly budgets. This is a condition I labeled “vetocracy.” ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=1908))

- Conservatives have one of two choices to make in the face of changing demography.

- British conservatives, on the other hand, reacted differently, by accepting and seeking to manage social change. It was Conservative prime minister Benjamin Disraeli who pushed the Second Reform Bill in 1867, which greatly expanded the franchise.

([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09DBDMGMR&location=1953))
- This is what it would mean for conservatives to embrace classical liberal principles: they need to accept the fact of demographic diversity, and to make use of it to support conservative values that are not tied to fixed aspects of identity.

- There is a parallel problem on the progressive left, in its inability to embrace the country’s actual diversity. Diversity for this group refers primarily to specific types of social difference related to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. It often does not include political diversity, or diversity of religious views if the latter are held by conservative Christians. Critical theory has erected a large intellectual structure which permits progressives to write off that entire element of society as part of a racist, patriarchal power structure that is illegitimately clinging to its former privileges. Deeply held religious beliefs on issues like abortion and gay marriage do not represent acceptable alternative understandings of important moral issues, but are merely examples of bigotry and prejudice that need to be rooted out.

- Privacy is a necessary condition promoting democratic deliberation and compromise, required if individuals are ever expected to be honest about their views.
