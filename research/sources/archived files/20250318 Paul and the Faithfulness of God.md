### Highlights

- A new way of life is being attempted – by no means entirely discontinuous with what was there already, but looking at things in a new way, trying out a new path. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=834))

- Philemon was a householder (probably in Colosse) who had been converted under Paul’s ministry, probably in Ephesus. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=860))

- I should stress that I side with the majority of contemporary scholars, who think that the place where Paul was imprisoned at that stage was Ephesus. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=867))

- As he explains in the second letter to Corinth, written most likely a matter of weeks or months after this one, his own self-definition is focused on the claim that the one God, who ‘was reconciling the world to himself in the Messiah’, has ‘entrusted him with the message of reconciliation’.19 ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=899))

- I see his central request as straightforward and unambiguous. It comes at verse 17, which should be seen as effectively the start of a new paragraph: ‘So, anyway, if you reckon me a partner in your work, receive him as though he was me.’23 ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=920))

- It will have the effect, at the very least, in his not condemning Onesimus to any of the punishments which might have been expected – up to and including death by crucifixion. But Paul wants more than that. He wants Philemon to see him as a beloved brother. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=924))

- Here in Philemon there is an umbilical link between the central opening statement of Paul’s prayer in verse 6, where the active force is the koinōnia tēs pisteōs sou, ‘the partnership of your faith’, and verse 17, where Paul appeals to the fact that Philemon regards him as a koinōnos, ‘partner’. This is the central thrust of the letter – as it is, indeed, of much of Paul’s understanding of what it meant to be the Messiah’s people.

- Less well known than koinōnia, but no less significant, is the way Paul expresses the obligation which he understands to obtain between two or more members of the messianic family. They must ‘welcome’ (proslambanesthai) one another. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=938))

- Most of those who either congratulate Paul on asking for Onesimus’s freedom, or castigate him for not doing so, assume, shall we say, a black-and-white world in which the only thing a first-century moralist ought to say about slaves was ‘Free them all!’ The actual situation was somewhat different. As many have pointed out, freed slaves were by no means always better off. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=964))

- I think the majority are more or less correct: Paul did indeed want Onesimus back as a co-worker, and was hinting at emancipation.31 But I am inclined to think, in addition, that something else is going on which, like the emphasis on mutual reconciliation, points beyond the small horizons of this letter to the larger worldview upon which Paul draws elsewhere.

- Paul is sending him back into a dangerous and difficult situation, in which he will express a proper sorrow for anything he had done wrong, and a basic request: please allow me back without punishment, and I will serve you ‘for ever’.

- The threefold request to Philemon then looks like this. First, accept Onesimus back, in principle, as a humble but reconciled brother in Christ (though still as a slave); do not punish him. Second, please send him back to me as an assistant. Third, perhaps, in doing so, you will also give him his freedom. The double-effect biblical allusion says, on the one hand, ‘perhaps you will have him back for ever’ (the first of the requests), but, on the other, ‘perhaps you will do more than I say’ (the third).

- Paul’s prayer, then, is that the active koinōnia which goes with Philemon’s faith ‘may have its powerful effect’, will be energetic, in bringing about Christos, Messiah-family, in Colosse. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=1065))

- finishing with the two chapters, which remain foundational for the present volume, on Israel’s beliefs and hopes (chapters 9 and 10). The point of writing those chapters there was to avoid having to do so here, so I shall not repeat them, but refer the reader to them as part of the necessary preliminary work for the present book. This is perhaps especially true of NTPG’s section on the Pharisees (pages 181–203), ([Location 2658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2658))

- In my mind’s eye I see the whole of NTPG Part III as though they were physically part of this book, perhaps as a kind of microdot within the running head for every page, and I encourage readers to do the same. Much of that work was done nearly twenty years ago, but reading what I have been able to read on the subject in the intervening period has not made me wish to change much.

- Intertwined those worlds might be, but for both Saul of Tarsus and Paul the apostle the world still divided into two, the world of the Jews and the world of the non-Jews. He called non-Jews ‘the nations’, ta ethnē, perhaps indicating ‘the other nations’, since Jews themselves could be spoken of as a ‘nation’;7 or else he calls them ‘the Greeks’, though of course the majority of non-Jews were not ethnically Greek, and many would no more have Greek as their first language than might a Palestinian Jew. Sometimes, in a remarkably explicit synecdoche, Paul referred to them as ‘the foreskin’, hē akrobustia, highlighting the fact that for the Jews circumcision was not simply obedience to a command but a badge of cultural and ethnic identity, and that they viewed the rest of the world in terms of its non-possession of this badge. It is rather as if, today, a Sikh were to regard all non-Sikhs as ‘the unturbaned’. ([Location 2695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2695))

- That debate has settled down now, and I have not seen good reason to change my mind from the basic conclusions I drew at the time in NTPG chapter 7: that the Pharisees were far more than a small pure-food club; that they were active not only in promoting their own holiness (trying to live at home as if they were actually in the Temple, though not necessarily as priests per se12) but also in persuading other Jews to do the same;13 that they were very popular and influential in the first half of the first century AD;14 and that – a crucial point, this – many of them were (what we would call) highly politically active.

- But the rabbinic texts come from the period after the two major revolts (AD 66–70 and 132–5), which means that they have screened out more or less entirely that which was vital and central (by his own admission) for Saul of Tarsus, namely the tradition of ‘zeal for Torah’ which, looking back to Phinehas and Elijah, was ready to use violence to enforce Torah-observance on wayward Jews or to defend it against non-Jews. That road came to an end with bar-Kochba in 135. Texts from after this period have lost two things which seem to have been vital up to that point: not only that commitment to ‘zeal’ in terms of violent ‘political’ or ‘military’ action, but also the sense of an ongoing narrative which would reach its glorious climax in (what we call) the first century or thereabouts (see below).21 ([Location 2755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2755))

- To put it briefly: the chances are that the Pharisees, broadly speaking, should be understood in terms of an overriding concern for purity. There were purity-conscious dining clubs known as the Haberim, and it may be that the Pharisees included people who joined such groups, but in any case such a concern marked them out sharply from the non-purity-conscious ‘people of the land’.28 But purity was not, in the relevant period, their sole or even their primary concern – except insofar as ‘purity’ functioned as a code, both linguistically and in its symbolic meaning within a culture, for the Jews’ consciousness of their own distinctiveness, and the following through of that consciousness into social and political, and not merely cultic, stringency.

- before the debacle of AD 70 the main issue at stake for a Pharisee was not simply ‘how to maintain one’s own personal purity’, but ‘how to be a loyal Jew faced with pagan oppression from outside and disloyal Jews from within’. Purity was a sign and seal of that concern. ([Location 2797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2797))
- In our period it was the revolutionary wing of the Pharisees who were in the ascendancy, held back a bit by their more cautious colleagues but firmly in the driving seat until devastated by the fall of the city and the Temple. Even then, as I argued before, the revolutionary stream, though perhaps driven underground, did not go away. Represented by figures like Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, it was ready to emerge in the next generation, in the massive rebellion in which Akiba (a strong candidate for the title of greatest rabbinic teacher ever) hailed Simeon ben-Kosiba as ‘son of the star’ (i.e. ‘bar-Kochba), the Messiah promised in Numbers 24.17. Akiba perished, of course, along with his hero, his colleagues and the dreams of his people, in AD 135. But it was within this whole world, roughly… ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2799))

- This was above all a kingdom-of-God movement, with strong ideological links directly to the revolutionary Judaism in which Pharisees had taken part in the days of Herod and which came to a full flowering with the so-called ‘Zealot’ movement in the disastrous war against Rome (66–70).30 At the heart of Pharisaic Judaism, as with their putative successors the rabbis, stood prayer; at the heart of daily prayer stood the Shema (‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One!’); and one subsequent way of referring to someone saying the Shema, as in the memorable and moving description of Akiba’s death, was to say that he was ‘accepting upon himself the kingship of heaven’, in other words, was declaring that Israel’s God alone was the true king of the world.31 That is what the rebels had shouted under Herod: ‘No king but God’. The many points of interconnection between the actual content of the daily prayers, the Shema and the Eighteen Benedictions in particular, and the dangerous and contested political circumstances of the time, make it virtually impossible to imagine that devout Jews, heirs to the traditions of the Maccabees, of Daniel, and behind them to those great models of ‘zeal’, Phinehas and Elijah, would be able to invoke the one God without thereby intentionally praying for that one God to do for them what he had done for their ancestors in Egypt, overthrowing pagan tyrants and setting his people free.32 ‘Zeal’, even when not… ([Location 2807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2807))

- It meant being prepared to join in with the holy war, whenever it came, trusting that Israel’s God would be the enemy of Israel’s enemies.33 That is what ‘zeal’ was all about.

- My point here is that the principal debate between Hillel and Shammai, who flourished in the time of Herod, is almost certain to have been not about purity (though that mattered too) but about how to be a loyal Jew under an alien regime, whether that of Rome (who had run the country, whether directly or through client rulers, since Pompey’s invasion in 63 BC) or compromised local regimes like Herod’s. Should one find a way to live and let live? Hillel thought so – as did his successor, and probably grandson, Gamaliel.37 Shammai almost certainly thought not: one should strongly oppose the blasphemous imposition of paganism, after the example of the Maccabees and their distant biblical predecessors. And that meant violence – sacred violence, of course, but violence none the less. Hence the revolutionary movements under Herod; hence the build-up to war in the 50s and 60s; hence, fatefully, the massive support for Akiba and bar-Kochba in 132.38 ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2836))

- But we should note here that Paul had almost certainly been on the Shammaite side (granted the caution about oversimplification expressed a moment ago), and it is against that background that we must imagine all his rethinking and reworking of prayer, thought and life to have taken place. It is, frankly, inconceivable that someone from the more conciliatory wing of the Pharisaic movement would have taken the trouble to persecute the emerging Christian movement in the way he did. Gamaliel, as we saw, thought that this strange new sect would fall by its own weight, but that one should beware lest one be found fighting against God.40 Even if Saul of Tarsus had been Gamaliel’s student, as Acts 22.3 has him say (I take Hengel’s point that students like to study with the most exciting and learned teachers, not necessarily those with whom they will agree!41), he was certainly not acting in a Gamaliel-like, or Hillelite, fashion. Attempts to suggest that he had been a Hillelite on the grounds of some points in his later (Christian) writings miss the point. By Paul’s own account his way of looking at a great many things had changed radically. We should not be surprised if his Christian rethinking made some opinions come out looking like cousins of Hillel rather than Shammai.42 ([Location 2846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2846))

- This, indeed – confusing for us in a world where the word ‘Judaism’ refers to a ‘religion’ in our modern sense – seems to have been what Ioudaismos meant: not simply the practice of a ‘religion’, but the active propagation of the ancestral way of life and its defence against attack whether from outside (as in the case of Mattathias) or inside (as in the case of Saul of Tarsus).56 ([Location 2926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2926))

- The Diaspora itself is so obviously varied: Alexandria, Ephesus and Rome are hardly likely to produce identical cultural formation, even in a strongly bonded group with allegiance to a parent country and religion. As we saw in relation to Palestine, the Hillel/Shammai distinction was probably an over-schematization of a more complex state of affairs, and in any case it related only to one major party, the Pharisees, leaving out of the question the Sadducees and the Essenes, not to mention the great majority of Jews who were not aligned with any particular ‘party’.

- I was going to write that the Torah was hardly a symbol that you would hang on your wall (to make the point that Torah is something you do, not merely an ornament, like the fish-sign that a modern western Christian sticks on a car); but then I remembered that of course hanging things on the wall was precisely one of the things which devout Jews were commanded to do, and which they do to this day, so that mezuzoth greet you on your going out and coming in.60 ([Location 2953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2953))

- Whatever their higher or deeper meaning, these were things that should be done. Most Jews, not only Pharisees, circumcised their male children as a matter of course, but the emphasis on circumcision as a boundary-marker between Jews and non-Jews, so powerfully evident in Galatians, was foreshadowed by those episodes two hundred years earlier where some Jews tried to remove the marks of circumcision so that, when exercising naked à la Grècque in the shiny new Gymnasium in Jerusalem, they would not be mocked for their piety or nationality.63 The sabbath was such a solidly fixed institution that there are stories of Jews dying in large numbers rather than defend themselves… ([Location 2962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2962))

- the point of Torah as symbol is precisely the sense, widespread across ancient Jewish life and surely now uncontroversial among its contemporary interpreters, that Torah as a whole, and certain facets of it in particular, marked out the Jews from their non-Jewish neighbours. Particular emphases within wider morality did not so obviously have that function; adultery, for instance, though widely practised in the ancient non-Jewish world, was usually frowned upon by non-Jewish moralists, and the same went of course for theft and murder. But circumcision and sabbath, though the former was not absolutely unique to the Jews, were symbols which declared, not least in the Diaspora, ‘We are a different people, a people in covenant with the God who made heaven and earth.’67 Mattathias’s strictures come to mind again, as the corruptions of Hellenism swept through the middle east in the early years of the second… ([Location 2977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=2977))

- is more a matter of translating the life of the Temple (on which see below) into everyday life, a matter of particular importance for those who lived some distance away from Jerusalem, not least in the further reaches of the Diaspora. The obvious kosher restrictions were to be observed strictly: there are awful tales in the Maccabean literature and elsewhere of devout Jews having pork stuffed into their mouths by pagan enforcers, and of their going to great lengths to refuse it.70 Even in less troubled times, Jewish people living in non-Jewish countries, and otherwise enjoying good relations with their neighbours, regularly ran the risk of being regarded as socially disruptive or subversive because of their strict adherence to these ancestral codes.71 But the basic kosher regulations were just the start. While few Jews would have eaten pork or shellfish, the Pharisees went much further, as the Mishnah and a host of other writings make clear.

- But it was not just the food that you ate that marked you out. It was also the company you kept at table. Obviously the two would often go together, but even if non-Jewish acquaintances would have been happy to share a kosher meal in a Jewish home, the stricter Jews – and that was precisely how the Pharisees defined themselves – would not have been happy to have them at the same table. The stark statement in Acts should be taken very seriously: ‘You must know,’ said Peter, ‘that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to mix with or visit a Gentile.’ ([Location 3002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3002))
- Peter’s rationale, and his subsequent explanation to his interlocutors, was that he had had a vision in which, being invited to eat all kinds of unclean food, he was told that he should not regard as ‘unclean’ something which God had made clean.73 The unclean food was a metaphor for the unclean company, that being how purity codes work; but it was the company that mattered. Peter’s accusers in Jerusalem did not tell him off for eating unclean food (though that may have been implied as well) but for eating with non-Jews.

- We need to add to Barclay’s combination of ancestry and cultural practice some kind of implicit relationship to sacred geography.

- the practice of Torah in the Diaspora itself could be thought of in terms of gaining, at a distance, the blessings you would gain if you were actually there – the blessing, in other words, of the sacred presence itself, the Shekinah, the glory which supposedly dwelt in the Temple but would also dwell ‘where two or three study Torah’.84 ([Location 3049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3049))

- Synagogues were often built so that they pointed towards the Temple, or otherwise indicated their relation to it.86 Far-off Jews collected Temple-tax and transported it to Jerusalem so that they might take part in the sacrificial cult personally, albeit at a distance.87 Long centuries after the Temple had been destroyed, some continued to regard the activity of studying the laws concerning Temple-worship as the functional equivalent of taking part in the long-defunct liturgy.88 It would be a mistake to suppose that just because Pharisees developed strong Temple-substitutes (in part, no doubt, because of their frustration with the Sadducees who were actually running the Temple) they therefore disregarded the institution itself. Far from it. Like Philo, they could produce (as it were) symbolic or allegorical equivalents of the concrete reality, but the concrete reality still mattered. The wrong people might be in charge of it, but the Temple was still the Temple. ([Location 3053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3053))
- The point of the Temple – this is where I want to develop considerably further what was said in the earlier volumes – is that it was where heaven and earth met. It was the place where Israel’s God, YHWH, had long ago promised to put his name, to make his glory present. The Temple, and before it the wilderness tabernacle, were thus heirs, within the biblical narrative, to moments like Jacob’s vision, the discovery that a particular spot on earth could intersect with, and be the gateway into, heaven itself.90 In the later period, even synagogues could sometimes be thought of as meeting places between heaven and earth; how much more the actual Temple.91 The Temple was not… ([Location 3064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3064))

- was the place above all where the twin halves of the good creation intersected. When you went up to the Temple, it was not as though you were ‘in heaven’. You were actually there. That was the point. Israel’s God did not have to leave heaven in order to come down and dwell in the wilderness tabernacle or the Jerusalem Temple. However surprising it may be for modern westerners to hear it, within the worldview formed by the ancient scriptures heaven and earth were always made to work together, to interlock and overlap.

- The roots of this Temple-belief go back to the heart of the great controlling narrative: passover, exodus, freedom, Sinai, covenant, homecoming (I shall discuss the whole implicit and sometimes explicit ‘story’ of Israel below).94 Within the book of Exodus, no sooner had the children of Israel come out of Egypt and been given the law on Mount Sinai than Moses was given instructions on how to make the tabernacle.

- There was, of course, an unfortunate digression. Israel’s sin with the golden calf, a ghastly parody of the presence of the true God with his people, caused YHWH to threaten not to dwell in their midst after all, not to go with them into the promised land. This provoked the great crisis, and Moses’ great prayer, recorded in Exodus 32—4. But the tabernacle was eventually constructed according to plan – even though it now had to be situated outside the camp. There is something of a sigh of relief as the book of Exodus then reaches its climax: the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of YHWH filled the tabernacle. Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled upon it, and the glory of YHWH filled the tabernacle. Whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on each stage of their journey; but if the cloud was not taken up… ([Location 3087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3087))

As one recent writer has summarized it: The rest of the iconography that filled the Temple from its very beginning – the carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers in the inner shrine, the central hall, and on the doors leading into both rooms, the lily work, the lattice work, and the pomegranates on the bronze pillars, the… ([Location 3159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3159))

- John Walton, a former colleague of Beale’s though not in this work referring to him, has recently written a short work aimed at explicating aspects of Genesis 1 for an audience which finds it controversial. As part of that task, he builds on an earlier commentary on Genesis in which he has argued strongly, from evidence across the ancient near east, that the creation-account in Genesis 1 would have been understood in the world of its day as the construction not just of a garden but specifically of a temple, a place for the creator to live in. ‘God created the heavens and the earth’, creating them as a home for himself. Walton argues, suggestively, that the seventh day in Genesis 2.2–3 is not a ‘rest’ in the sense of a mere cessation of activity, but the equivalent of Psalm 132.14: this is God’s ‘resting-place’. He has finished the work of construction, which is to be seen as a prelude to all his intended work of developing it through the agency of his image-bearing human… ([Location 3187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3187))
- If the cosmic significance of the Temple is the first main point to be made about Israel’s central symbol, the second is much more sharply focused. The Temple was inextricably bound up, in Jewish thought from a thousand years before Paul, with the royal house of David. It was David who conceived the idea of the Temple, even though it was Solomon who built it; Chronicles in particular emphasizes that David had the entire scheme laid out for Solomon to implement, rather like God showing Moses the plan of the tabernacle on the mountain so that he could go down and get to work. There is here an echo, perhaps, of the figure of Wisdom in Proverbs 8, being at the right hand of the creator and bringing his plans to birth: Moses, like Solomon, is the truly wise man, and indeed both Moses and Solomon enlist, for the construction of their respective buildings, the services of men who are said to be especially equipped with the divine spirit and wisdom.121 Solomon’s prayer for wisdom is indeed intimately… ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3199))

- There was then a hiatus until the second century BC, when Judas Maccabaeus cleansed and restored the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus Epiphanes.

Arguably, one of the motives of Herod the Great in rebuilding the Temple to be the most stunning piece of architecture in the ancient world was the hope that, despite even less auspicious ancestry, he might legitimate at least his successors as the true kings of the Jews.126 The question of kingship hung ominously over the first century along with the question of the Temple, which was scarcely completed in its new magnificence before the Romans finally burnt it down once and for all.

YHWH has abandoned the Temple to its fate, thereby removing his presence from Israel and leaving king and nation to their fate.

The long book of Ezekiel closes with a great reprise of the climax of Exodus, the promise of a rebuilt Temple with YHWH coming to take up residence, so that ‘the name of the city from that time on shall be, YHWH is There.’129 But Haggai had to encourage Zerubbabel and his colleagues, working as they were on the new Temple, to believe that YHWH’s spirit was present among them, as it had been before, and that there would be a new moment, a great convulsion, in which YHWH would shake both heavens and earth.130 Then and only then would the divine presence return: I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I… ([Location 3237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3237))
- Perhaps most strikingly, Malachi castigates the priests in the second Temple for their lackadaisical approach to worship and sacrifice. He warns them that, though YHWH has not yet returned to the Temple, he will do so soon enough, and then he will execute judgment on those who have not taken him seriously: See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight – indeed, he is coming, says YHWH of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?133 These promises of YHWH’s return echo through the long years of the second-Temple period. But at no point does anybody suggest that they have at last been fulfilled.134 There is a strange silence precisely where we might have expected a claim parallel to that of Exodus 40 or 1 Kings 8.

- Sirach, it is normally supposed, was written around 200 BC or soon after.138 Within a generation, all was swept away by the arrogant Syrian king, relentlessly enforcing pagan worship on the Jews and desecrating the Holy Place itself. That, too, was short-lived, as Judas Maccabaeus cleansed the Temple and restored the proper worship. But at no point then, either, did even the adulatory books of the Maccabees claim that the glorious presence of their God had actually returned. There is no mention of the house being filled with a cloud, of the priests being unable to stand before the glory, and so forth. The narrative is strangely incomplete. The boast of Sirach is not repeated. Nobody suggested that the Hasmonean high priests, or their successors in the time of Jesus and Paul, were vessels of divine glory.

Touch one and you would touch them all. Torah itself intersected with everything else, being the true repository of wisdom.140 The equation of Sirach 24 could be turned the other way round: if the Temple was the place where Wisdom/Torah had made its home, any place in which Torah was studied might become an alternative Temple.

- All generalizations about ‘what all Jews believed’ or ‘the stories all Jews knew’ are subject to the proper question: all of them? How do we know? Were not these hopes and dreams confined to a small, and perhaps scribal, elite who actually read the texts and knew these stories? In the ancient world, with far fewer books than today, most in any case not accessible to most people, the majestic biblical narrative would in fact stand out all the more. They were reinforced, for those who could not read, by the annual festivals: the story of the creator and the cosmos, of humans and their dignity and plight, and particularly of Israel – the patriarchs, the sojourn in Egypt, the exodus, Sinai, the wanderings and homecoming, the monarchy, the prophets, the exile ([Location 3303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3303))

- Even for those whose every waking thought concerned family, food, water supplies, and eking out a daily existence, the great stories provided hope: one day our God will act, and this will all be different. As with an East German in the 1970s, or a black South African in the same period, the complex business of daily life would be shot through with a story, operating at a different level of consciousness, in which the injustice of the present would be linked to the future hope: one day we shall be free. You do not have to be a literate scribe to have that narrative in your head and your heart. For second-Temple Jews, of course, all this would be reinforced by the Psalms, retelling the ancient stories and posing exactly the questions many would raise of their own accord: has our God forgotten to be gracious? If we are people of Abraham, of Moses, of David, why has all this come upon us?143 ([Location 3310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3310))

- In short, despite the danger of generalization, we can and must say that most Jews of Paul’s day perceived themselves, at a deep, worldview level, as living in a story in search of an ending. If Israel’s God was indeed faithful, then the story could not simply collapse, implode, self-destruct. The narrative tension increased with every passing year, every false dawn, every would-be Messiah. Sometimes it looked as though the great event had happened, or was happening, and, like climbers reaching what they thought was the mountain-top, only to find another sheer rock face ahead, the devout Israelites suffered disappointments all the worse for having built up expectations. That, I take it, was how the slow disaffection after the Maccabean revolt affected pious Jews, precipitating (more or less) the formation of Pharisees and Essenes as movements determined not to lose the momentum, to find a way forward and tackle that rock face whatever it might cost. The story thus develops the quality of a musical sequence which the listeners expect to arrive at a resolution but which, instead, merely increases in intensity until our spines tingle and we realize that this is a truly awful, truly aweful, moment. I have in mind the hair-raising effect in Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, in which what should be the penultimate chord of the ‘Lachrymosa’ from Mozart’s Requiem, the first half of the concluding ‘Amen’, ought to resolve from its subdominant G minor back to D minor, but instead merely goes on,… ([Location 3317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3317))

He will enable the present Israel to stay loyal, will protect his people from the wicked pagan world, and will rescue them and give them what he had promised, the sovereignty over the world which had been theirs a thousand years before in the golden age of David and Solomon.146 What they need is what had been provided from early on: the Temple as the place of YHWH’s presence; the Torah as the guiding way of life; the king as the leader and deliverer, the people’s focal point and military leader.

- But things have gone horribly wrong. The Temple has been destroyed, and even though it has been rebuilt there is a widespread sense that all is not well, what with a corrupt priesthood and a sense that the liturgy is being performed according to wrong interpretations of Torah (so, particularly, the view from Qumran). What is now needed is a rescue operation, to enable the ‘helpers’ in the first diagram (Temple, Torah, king) to do their job: 2. Topical Sequence – in other words, Israel’s covenant God will raise up, or perhaps has already raised up, a renewal movement whose task is to outwit the wicked or slothful, the renegades within Israel who are no better than the wicked pagans outside, and so to revive Torah-keeping and restore the Temple and/or its liturgy.

- The basic Pharisaic story was not, then, about the sort of question that has exercised western theology over the last half-millennium. The reason a Pharisee studied and elucidated Torah, and tried both to keep it himself and to get more and more other people to do so, was not because of some moralistic scheme, designed to enable him to earn favour with a potentially angry deity and so to reach a ‘solution’ which was basically an otherworldly salvation.

- This has then given rise to the proposal, endemic in western readings of Paul for many centuries, that God would instead undo the initial sequence altogether (very bad narrative grammar, that, reflecting very bad theology) and enable something else to take place: instead of the law as such, faith. This would then give rise to the possibility of a quite different move: 2. Hypothetical topical sequence (Christian) which would arrive at a ‘solution’ which would in fact be far more congenial within Platonic thought than within a Jewish (or, indeed, early Christian) way of looking at God, the world and salvation.

- Reading through (say) Josephus, the Scrolls, and the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, and indeed the rabbis, this is simply not how they were thinking. They were not asking about ‘life after death’.

What mattered far more, as I argued in the previous volume, was ‘the age to come’; and this did not mean ‘life after death’ but ‘life after “life after death” ’, in other words, a period of being ‘dead’, however that is described, followed by resurrection into God’s new creation.148 And the reason first-century Jews, especially Pharisees, were interested in resurrection was because they believed in a God who was the creator of the whole world, and whose faithfulness demanded that he not abandon this creation to chaos. It was not enough to rescue Israel. This God would rescue the whole world.149 That, indeed, in some brave visions, was the point of it all in the first place.

Second, there is every indication that Pharisees, like other Jews of the period, did not expect that decisive moment to involve the collapse or disappearance of the universe of space, time and matter. It would involve, rather, the transformation, redemption and renewal of that universe.

- The main point about narratives in the second-Temple Jewish world, and in that of Paul, is not simply that people liked telling stories as illustrations of, or scriptural proofs for, this or that experience or doctrine, but rather that second-Temple Jews believed themselves to be actors within a real-life narrative. To put it another way, they were not merely story-tellers who used their folklore (in their case, mostly the Bible) to illustrate the otherwise unrelated joys and sorrows, trials and triumphs, of everyday life. Their narratives could and did function typologically, that is, by providing a pattern which could be laid as a template across incidents and stories from another period without any historical continuity to link the two together. But the main function of their stories was to remind them of earlier and (they hoped) characteristic moments within the single, larger story which stretched from the creation of the world and the call of Abraham right forwards to their own day, and (they hoped) into the future.152 ([Location 3411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3411))

- Overarching narrative mattered enormously in the world of Saul of Tarsus. He, and for that matter other Pharisees, Essenes, revolutionaries of various sorts, and no doubt plenty of other Jews too, were not wondering primarily how they could develop their own piety. They were not asking how they might find their way out of this world to ‘heaven’. Nor were they simply saying, ‘We are fed up with our present rulers; let’s hope our God will do something to help’, and then going back to a few ancient oracles to see if there were hints as to how such a deliverance might come about. They were more like people who find themselves hired to act in a play, only to find that they are cast in roles which come on stage in the fifth act, and that to grasp what’s going on, and hence the particular nuances of the lines they have to speak, they must understand the full flow of the much longer drama which has already taken place, and particularly the questions that are to be resolved.

- The Bible was not merely a source of types, shadows, allusions, echoes, symbols, examples, role-models and other no doubt important things. It was all those, but it was much, much more. It presented itself as a single, sprawling, complex but essentially coherent narrative, a narrative still in search of an ending. And one of the central features of the implicit story in the mind and heart of a first-century Pharisee, sectarian or revolutionary was the weight of that continuing narrative, the responsibility to take it forward, the possibility that all its threads might now come together, that the rich tapestry of Israel’s history would disclose its full pattern at last, that the faithfulness of the one true God would be revealed to them but also through them.

- But read Josephus, and it becomes clear: here are the revolutionaries, he says, who are doing what they are doing because of an oracle in their scriptures according to which at that time deliverance would come to Israel. As I argued before, the only oracle which makes sense in this context, according to Josephus’s strong hint elsewhere, is the book of Daniel.154 And Daniel is precisely all about a story which goes on for many generations, as world powers rise and fall, climaxing in one superpower that will do its worst – whereupon the living God will set up a kingdom which cannot be shaken, will bring forth a ‘stone’ that will smash the great statue and bring it tumbling down, will raise up ‘one like a son of man’ and exalt him to dominion and glory over the nations, will bring about the real return from exile …155 ([Location 3463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3463))
- Behind all this, of course, is the tradition of telling and retelling Israel’s story, which continued unabated from early times into Paul’s day and beyond.156 This substantial and varied tradition is not usually factored into discussions of Paul. But there are key passages in his letters which will not make sense (or, worse, will be taken to make the wrong sense) unless we see them in relation to this tradition. As we shall now see, this habit of retelling Israel’s story took many forms, but those who deployed it in one way or another were always fully aware of the story as a single story, with its several elements always in the right order (they were not, in other words, snatching items at random as miscellaneous examples or warnings). Many of these retellings, though not all, told the story in terms of Israel’s constant failure, rebellion and sin, with only a dramatic rescue operation, in fulfilment of the original divine purpose and vocation, to save them from utter disaster. Many of them, though by no means all, told the story in terms of the key figures who would play their parts and lead the eye up to one figure in particular. While it is not always clear who this strange figure will be, we can be sure, from the texts which do make it clear, that many would have read the less clear texts in this way as well. For many, the story will reach its goal with a Messiah. ([Location 3471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3471))

- The book of Deuteronomy as a whole plays this sort of role, beginning with the rehearsal of, so to speak, ‘the story so far’, and ending with prophecies of the future. Of particular note is the narrative which Israelites are commanded to rehearse on coming to Jerusalem in festival: ‘A wandering Aramean was my father …’ We note, as well, that the narratives, beginning with Deuteronomy itself, are anything but smooth accounts of an unbroken ‘salvation-history’. They are on the contrary accounts of Israel’s persistent rebellion and God’s judgment and mercy, a theme that continues into the surprisingly dark warnings of the great poem in chapter 32.158 In particular, as we shall see below, the ‘covenant’ chapters of Deuteronomy 27—30 functioned in the second-Temple period as a prophecy of the bad times to come (specifically, the extended exile) and of the covenant renewal that would ultimately come about.

- The Psalms provide a major source of compact Israel-narratives. Psalm 78 speaks of the constant rebellion of Israel at the time of the exodus, the giving of Torah, the entry into the land, and the subsequent life in Israel. At last, however, God sends David, and causes the Temple to be built on Mount Zion; one can sense a sigh of relief, though of course this, too, does not last.161 Psalms 105 and 106 balance one another.162 Psalm 105 celebrates the story from the covenant with Abraham through the promise of the land, the sojourn in Egypt, the exodus, and the settlement in Canaan, the purpose of it all being that Israel might keep God’s statutes and observe his laws. Here, one might suppose, is the smooth, positive progression, so often posited as a caricature by those who scorn any sort of ‘salvation-history’; but it does not last.

- Daniel 9 confesses the sins of the people, acknowledges that YHWH is in the right and Israel in the wrong, but then appeals to that same ‘righteousness’ of God as the basis for mercy and restoration.170 Meanwhile chapter 9 as a whole takes its place, along with Daniel 2 and 7, in terms of a rather different narrative. Chapters 2 and 7 tell the story, not of Israel alone, but of a succession of world-empires. These empires will be called to account, and then superseded by the new kingdom which God will set up through the ‘stone’ in chapter 2, the ‘one like a son of man’ in chapter 7, and now the ‘prince’ – though his fate remains deeply mysterious – in chapter 9.171 In texts like this it is important to remember that what counts for our purposes is not so much any meanings that the text might have had ‘originally’ (whatever that means) but the ways in which it was being read in the first century.

- Much of the story as we have told it so far is about expectations of rescue, of release from slavery and exile. But both in Daniel 2 and 7, and in the later retrievals of those passages such as we find in 4 Ezra, there is something more. Back in the Deuteronomic covenant was the promise that if Israel obeyed they would be the most important and powerful nation on earth.172 All would see that they were called by YHWH’s name, and blessed by him; they would be ‘the head, and not the tail’, at ‘the top, and not at the bottom’.173 This will of course be reversed if Israel disobeys;174 but if and when Israel turns again, with a renewed heart, the promise will finally come true.175 This relates closely to the various Pentateuchal promises concerning the coming king, who will receive the obedience of the peoples, and be lord over many nations.176 The theme of a coming universal monarch is continued in the prophets, and found at Qumran.177 These promises are linked in Deuteronomy 30 to the theme of the return from exile, the ingathering of the dispersed tribes.178 ([Location 3533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3533))

- With the Syrian invasion, a new reality entered the Jewish world of the second century BC: the Maccabean rebellion and its aftermath. The call to arms issued by old Mattathias, father of Simeon and Judas Maccabaeus, consists as we saw of a long narrative which begins with Abraham: he, says the old man, was found pistos when tested, and ‘it was reckoned to him as righteousness.’186 Mattathias then continues through Joseph, Phinehas, Joshua, Caleb, David and Elijah, and concludes with Daniel and his companions in Babylon. Here the climax is clear: not the priests in the Temple, but the courageous young military leaders Simeon and Judah are the ones to carry this great narrative forward to its God-ordained conclusion, winning victory over the pagans.187 ([Location 3568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3568))

- Third, in consequence, in more or less all cases the story being told is a story in which the writer believes that he and his readers are still participants. Here we find again the major difference between this way of thinking and that of the rabbis, who were ‘indifferent to historiography’, and had indeed ‘totally rejected the Hebrew Bible’s historical way of thinking and replaced it with a paradigmatic approach to time and events’.259 Examples and warnings abound in these retellings, but they are not free-floating moral lessons detached from the historical narrative.

- One could, indeed, turn the point around. If it is true that when such stories reach a climax with a particular figure that figure is likely to be the Messiah, it is all the more true that one of the key things about a Messiah, however varied the portrait in other respects, is that the Messiah will precisely bring the story of Israel to its goal, fulfilling the ancient promises, especially those to Abraham, and rescuing the nation from the appalling mess into which its many rebellions have landed it. There are almost as many varieties of messianic expectation as there are relevant texts and movements. ([Location 3917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=3917))

- God is faithful; creation is faithful; and one day that faithfulness will be worked out through the fulfilment of the long history of Abraham’s people, of David’s descendants, and of those who in the present are faithful in terrible times. That faithfulness will result, for the author of the Psalms of Solomon, in God sending a Messiah who would embody that faithfulness and fulfil at last the ancient dream of Psalm 2, bringing the nations of the world to see the glory of the lord and to live under his rule. This, I suggest, was at the heart of the worldview of many first-century Jews, and particularly of a first-century Pharisee. This is the story in which Saul of Tarsus believed himself to be living. Paul the apostle, as we shall see, believed that this story had been fulfilled, though certainly not in the way he or anyone else had expected.

- Perhaps we can get at the heart of what I am saying like this: that, within the continuing narrative which virtually all Jews believed themselves to be living in, which we have studied at some length above, a great many second-Temple Jews interpreted that part of the continuing narrative in which they were living in terms of the so-called Deuteronomic scheme of sin–exile–restoration, with themselves still somewhere in the middle stage, that of ‘exile’ (which, granted, could itself become quite complicated).

- The solution then is a non-narratival world, or rather a narratival world where the only ‘story’ is ‘my story with God’ on the one hand, or a narratival world where the main ‘story’ is God’s invasion of the cosmos, without reference to the covenant, on the other.269 Hence the eagerness in older protestant exegesis to find parallels with, or derivations from, the pagan religions on the one hand or incipient gnosticism on the other, both worldviews that (like the rabbis, ironically) lacked a larger continuous narrative. And even when conservative expositors eschew that route, there is still as we shall see a worrying resemblance between the question ‘How can I find a gracious God?’ – let alone ‘How can I go to heaven when I die?’ – and the questions asked by Seneca or Epictetus.270 Anything rather than admit to a continuing historical narrative.

- But the point, however you calculated it, was this: Jeremiah said that the exile would last seventy years, and Daniel was told that this had to be interpreted as ‘seventy times seven’. That’s what the text said, and there is abundant evidence that after the time of Daniel – certainly from the mid-second century onwards, through at least to the second century of the Common Era – people were calculating exactly that. All this is evidence, of course, not only that many Jews of the time believed in a continuing exile but also that they were indeed thinking in terms of a continuous history.

- A good deal of the secondary literature on the hope of second-Temple Jews has assumed that ultimate salvation is emphatically otherworldly. Often this is simply taken for granted. You don’t look at your spectacles until looking through them becomes difficult. This assumed otherworldly salvation, ‘going to heaven when you die’, has then contextualized and conditioned the ways in which scholars and preachers alike have handled the questions which swirl around ‘salvation’: questions, not least, of justification, the law, ‘works’, ‘grace’, and so on. But the second-Temple texts themselves tell strongly against an ‘otherworldly’ salvation; against (that is) the notion that the ultimate aim of humans in general and Jews in particular was the escape of saved souls from their present embodiment and indeed from space, time and matter altogether. In the texts we have studied, and in particular in the continuous story we have been examining, the aim and goal does not have to do with the abolition of the universe of space, time and matter, or the escape of humans from such a wreckage, but with its consummation.349 ([Location 4445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4445))

- We could in fact read widely in the Jewish literature of the time without gaining any sense, except through one or two short passages taken out of context, that the writers had in mind the souls of the righteous leaving this present world and going off for ever into a non-spatio-temporal eternity.350 That Platonic vision, as I have argued elsewhere, cuts clean across the robustly creational hope of the great majority of first-century Jews, Pharisees included.

- Two things follow from this. First, it is massively misleading to bring to the texts the question ‘What must I do to inherit eternal life?’ in the sense that almost all modern western persons would understand. In the gospels, of course, that question is asked by a second-Temple Jew, and as I and others have made clear it did not mean ‘How can I go to heaven when I die?’ but rather ‘How can I be part of the coming age, the age to come, ha‘olam ha-ba?’353 As all the texts we have mentioned make clear, this ‘age to come’ was not much like the ‘heaven’ of medieval and post-medieval western imagination, and much more like the liberated Israel, and perhaps the liberated world, of biblical and second-Temple hope.354 If instead we insist on projecting on to the texts the questions of individual salvation, in a classic western heaven-or-hell scheme, trying to discern where they fit in terms of the ‘qualifications’ people might have for the one or the other, and how (either through God’s grace or human merit or some combination of the two) some might attain such a salvation, we will simply miss the entire story within which the writers of those texts were living. And in doing this we will, almost certainly, distort quite radically the other terms that cluster around the larger notion of ‘salvation’. ([Location 4462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4462))
- This relatively modern approach to the texts, understanding them in terms of a non-spatio-temporal ‘salvation’, is basically telling the wrong story. It collapses ‘Israel’s story’, the main theme of book after book in the literature we have surveyed, into ‘my story’, the story of the individual soul on the way to heaven or hell. In the modern world, ‘my story’ is then contextualized, by implication, within a larger implicit narrative: either the modern dream of ‘personal fulfilment’, or the Platonic one of leaving this world and going to a disembodied one instead; or some combination of the two. But to tell the story like this is arguably to take a large step away from the basic Jewish worldview and towards an essentially pagan one.

That is a regular slur against fresh interpretations of Paul, but it misses the point entirely. Of course ‘salvation’ matters. What is being said, however, is (a) that salvation doesn’t mean what the western tradition has often taken it to mean (escaping to a disembodied ‘heaven’), (b) that it is in any case not the main topic of most of the texts, and (c) that it is not the main narrative which they are trying to explicate.

- For the moment we conclude as follows. There is no good reason to suppose that a hard-line Pharisee like Paul, standing in the tradition (however loose that tradition might be) that stretched back, via Shammai, to Judas Maccabaeus and, in the distance, to Phinehas and Elijah, and that stretched forwards to Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and the supporters of bar-Kochba – there is no good reason to suppose either that anybody in that tradition was expecting, wanting or hoping for the end of the space-time universe, or that the dramatic language they sometimes employed was intended to denote such an ‘event’. If Paul the apostle believed in such a thing, this would be a Christian innovation. ([Location 4527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4527))

All will be well at last, not in some second cosmos created after the sun, moon and stars of the first one have collapsed, but in the Jerusalem that will have been renewed by a mighty divine act for which the only appropriate language is found to be the cosmic metaphor: the collapse of the old order and the creation of a new one.

- This leads to a further point of enormous importance. The literature we call ‘apocalyptic’ frequently refers to actual catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, famines and the like.386 The reader naturally and rightly takes such references as being to concrete events in the natural and human world. There is no sense that they are metaphorical, or a code for something else. These are frequently referred to as ‘portents’, events which function as signs of great events soon to occur. Of course, right across the ancient world and sometimes the modern world too, what we normally call ‘natural phenomena’ – actual rainbows, actual shooting stars, actual eclipses of the sun or moon, and so on – were and are seen in this way, as ‘signs’. ([Location 4668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4668))

- But, to say it once more, the fact that all these things, falling stars, monstrous births, the raining of blood, sudden thunderstorms, statues that started to behave strangely, and so on, were all ‘taken literally’, i.e. believed to refer to actual concrete events, did not mean that they were understood as signs of further concrete events of the same sort – all the stars falling, all animals having monstrous births, all statues misbehaving, and so on. They were signs that great and frightening changes were taking place, or about to take place, in what, today, we refer to as the ‘socio-political’ world: in other words, they referred to equally concrete events (they were not ‘metaphors’ for ‘spiritual realities’) but of a different sort. It will not do to use the phrase ‘socio-political’ dismissively, as Adams does, as though these were ‘mere’, irrelevant political goings-on. We moderns should not forget that in the ancient world many rulers were regarded, quite genuinely, as divine, as were many cities (think of Athene and Roma, for a start). If Caesar dies, if Athens falls, we are not talking about ‘trivial’ socio-political events. We are talking about events in which the whole complex divine and human fabric is being ripped apart, with unforeseeable and terrifying consequences.390 ([Location 4689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4689))

- ‘Apocalyptic’ is deeply political.391 Now of course one could say that it is ‘political’ to declare that the space-time universe is coming to a shuddering halt; that does indeed reduce to irrelevance otherwise impressive displays of earthly power. But this does not seem to be how ‘political’ is being used in recent studies. ‘Apocalyptic’ literature, whether in the second-Temple Jewish world or early Christianity, seems to be designed to give its hearers and readers an alternative frame of reference within which to live their lives, an alternative narrative to that which the world’s power-brokers are putting out, an alternative symbolic universe to reshape their imagination and structure their worldview. People whose worldviews are thus realigned may not instantly form political parties or take up arms to march against enemies, but they will live differently.

- There can be no doubt that this was the effect which was created by the early Christians, not least by Paul, and we have good reason to think that their use of ‘apocalyptic’ language, exactly in the tradition of the second-Temple Jews, was a significant part of how this effect was generated. They did not expect the stars to fall from the sky. They did expect the creator God to do extraordinary things for which comets, earthquakes and other portents might be powerful and appropriate metaphors.

- All that we have said so far leads back to a point of enormous importance for our reading of Paul the apostle. The primary way in which scripture itself was seen was not simply as a rag-bag, a miscellaneous collection of texts from which one might summon up a maxim, an example, a historical insight, a ‘type’ or whatever. All of those are of course there in profusion. But they are seen, even sometimes by an allegorist like Philo, and certainly by second-Temple Jews with a reforming agenda, such as Qumran and the Pharisees, in terms of the overall narrative within which the second-Temple reader was presumed to be living. Scripture functioned as the earlier acts in the play in which Essene covenanters, Pharisaic sages, revolutionary leaders and others all assumed themselves to be actors. Some parts of the earlier story contained promises and warnings about times far ahead in the future. Deuteronomy 27—30, as we have seen, was regularly read in that way, with Leviticus 26 coming in alongside and adding the note of ‘sabbath’. Daniel – the whole book, not just the cryptic chronological clues in chapter 9 – was read as the script for a great social, cultural, political and of course theological drama which was even now rushing towards its denouement.

- They were precisely living within a narrative: a worldview within which the primary legislation had been laid down but within which, in their own day, fresh work was needed. The fact that they conceived of that fresh work in terms of the interpretation and application of Torah grows naturally out of what we have already seen in this chapter, that Torah was already playing a role of community formation and definition, not simply one of moral guidance for the puzzled individual. In particular, we should be clear that this development and intensification contributes directly to the vision of Deuteronomy 30: this is how Israel must turn back to YHWH with heart and soul, and discover and obey the full meaning of Torah. The development of oral law, then, should also be seen within an implicit eschatological narrative, at least in the period before AD 135. This is part of how Israel must advance towards the divinely promised future. ([Location 4733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4733))

- Within that, too, we must make the point that, even when it often seems obscure to a present-day reader, the context of a scriptural allusion or echo is again and again very important. Whole passages, whole themes, can be called to mind with a single reference. This point, naturally, has to be tested against individual passages, but when that is done the test regularly comes out positive. Those who studied scripture intensively, which of course includes Essenes and Pharisees in particular, knew the material inside out and could evoke a whole world of textual reference with a word or phrase.

Who are we? We are a group of Jews who find ourselves dissatisfied with the way our country is being run and with our life as a people, at home and abroad.

- What’s wrong? There are not nearly enough of us who take Torah with proper seriousness, and even among those who do there are schools developing which the tough-minded among us regard as dangerously compromised. What counts, after all, is absolute purity. We do not imagine that we never sin, or never incur impurity, but we deal with it at once according to the methods and means of atonement and purification given by God and prescribed in the law. That is what it means to be ‘perfect in the law’. But we cannot compromise or collude with the wickedness we see in the nations all around us, and that goes especially for the rulers of the nations. Ever since the days in Egypt, and then again from the time in Babylon (where some of us still are) to the present, we have known what pagan rulers are like, and what it’s like to live under them. We will not be content until we no longer have to live as, in effect, slaves under these pagans, paying them taxes.

To the larger-scale problem: to pray (prayer is especially important; the Shema alone is the very foundation of our existence) and to wait in purity, to keep the feasts and the fasts, to study scripture … and perhaps, so some of us think, to join up with those who are eager for armed resistance and revolution. We have as our great models of ‘zeal for Torah’ the heroes of old, Phinehas and Elijah especially. They were not afraid to use the sword in the service of God. Nor were our more recent heroes, the Maccabaean freedom-fighters.

The ‘present age’ will give way to the ‘age to come’;397 the present time is the time of continuing exile and slavery, despite various false dawns; some of us did make it back to our own land, but whether we did or didn’t we are still in the long, dark period Daniel 9 predicted, the ‘exile’ of Deuteronomy 28. The coming age, however, will be the time of freedom, and some of us have begun to think that maybe that coming age is being secretly inaugurated as we develop and pass on the oral law and do our best to keep it. Maybe that’s the way God’s faithfulness is being revealed. Meanwhile, we are frustrated that the great biblical laws about jubilee have usually been honoured in the breach rather than the observance. We who keep the sabbath very carefully week by week are hoping and praying for the great Sabbath, the time when our God will have completed the work of rescuing Israel, and we can enjoy ‘rest’ like Joshua’s people did once the land was settled.

- The fundamental Jewish confession, the Shema, is not a mere intellectual assent to a proposition about the inner being of the one God. It is a commitment, a moment of as it were saluting the flag, a personal statement of allegiance to this God in particular. To say, ‘Hear, O Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is one’ is a way of saying, at the same time, ‘No other gods before this one!’ And that is a way of saying, ‘We are to keep ourselves from the idols of the nations, and to do our best to work for the overthrow of their blasphemies.’ Thus what might seem to us like abstract concepts about the one God are in fact to be seen as a means of stiffening resistance to persecution, summoning up courage for martyrdom.

- Within this kind of monotheism, prayer leads directly to engagement with the challenges of the social and political world, and vice versa. This is part of what is meant by insisting that first-century Pharisaic monotheism was creational and covenantal monotheism: the one God was not a pantheist’s god, ‘the divine’ within to pan (‘everything’). Nor was he a Deist’s or Epicurean god, a distant, faceless bureaucrat who might indeed be enjoying himself thoroughly because he was so far away from the muddle and mess of our world. That is why Jews in general, and Pharisees in particular, were averse to joining in other cults in the Diaspora, even cults of a supposed ‘One God’.405 The Pharisee’s one God was the God who made the world and was thoroughly engaged with it without being identified with it. The world was not just ‘good’, as though in a kind of concession (‘Well, I suppose it’s all right’), but full of his glory, charged with his grandeur, silently telling the story from day to day and night to night. The creator was not simply the sum total of the divine impulses and energies within the world. Rather, the Pharisees (like many other Jews) were happy to speak of the creator God graciously condescending to dwell in the Temple, and (as a substitute, but an important one for the majority who could not get to the Temple day by day) in and through Torah. This God was not far away. His presence and power could be known and felt, in and as Torah, Shekinah, Wisdom. His glory and his name were his gifts to his people as they worshipped, prayed, sacrificed, studied and obeyed.

- When Josephus describes the Pharisees as believing in ‘synergism’, over against the Sadducees who believed in ‘free will’ and the Essenes who believed in ‘determinism’, the strong probability, I believe, is that this is Josephus’s translation of political reality into apparently harmless philosophical categories. The powerful, aristocratic Sadducees believed they could do what they liked; the disempowered Essenes believed that they simply had to wait for God to act; the Pharisees believed that they were required to work towards bringing God’s kingdom, even though in the end it was up to God himself how and when he would do it. Those are the three-dimensional versions of the two-dimensional analysis Josephus presents for the benefit of his non-Jewish readers. But the created order was basically good, as was its ordering through human structures. The present human occupiers of those structures could be called to account, or replaced by other humans who would do a better job. All that seems basic to Pharisaic theology.

- Jewish monotheism offers, as its basic solution to the problem of evil, belief in election, in the creator’s choice of a people as his own, to serve his larger purposes. Abraham and his family are to become the means of restoring humanity, restoring the garden; hence the promise of the land.407 (This is not, it should be noted, an attempt to answer the question of why there is ‘evil’ in the creator’s good world in the first place, but rather an attempt to say what he is going to do about it. Like Marx, ancient Jews seem to have thought that the point was not to explain the world but to change it. Only when faced with the terrible events of AD 70 do writers like 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch invoke the idea that human evil, including the continuing guilt of Israel itself, must be traced back to Adam.408) Philo has a remarkable statement of this doctrine of redemptive election: the Jewish people are to the world what the priest is to the state; in other words, they are on the one hand the people of prayer in the midst of the world, and on the other hand the people through whom the one God makes his will known to all people.409 This idea of Israel as the special people of the one God is woven into every strand of Jewish life; the Pharisees made it their business to embody it.

- But what happens when election seems itself to be called into question, as for instance by great national disasters up to and including exile and/or the destruction of Jerusalem? That is precisely the problem of Psalm 89 and elsewhere, the question with which the great exilic prophets particularly wrestled, the question addressed also by Deuteronomy 27—32. It was also, of course, the problem faced in one way or another throughout the second-Temple period and all the way on to AD 135.413 Without wishing to be too explicit too soon, it may be worth stressing here and now: this is the sharp edge of the question faced by second-Temple Jews, the primary question to which the earliest Christians perceived the achievement of Jesus to be the answer.

- We have thus approached, from the theological angle, the topic we discovered at the heart of our study of the narrative world of second-Temple Jews. If Israel is chosen to be the people through whom the creator will put the world to rights, what happens when Israel itself needs to be put to rights? The answer given by the Pharisees was reasonably clear: Israel needs to learn how to keep Torah, how to keep it properly this time. If Israel wants the covenant God to be faithful to his promises and bring the restoration they longed for, Israel has to be faithful to this God, to Torah, to the covenant. Plenty of evidence in scripture itself indicated that something like this was the right answer. Since Paul the apostle basically agrees with this answer, though providing a radical and shocking… ([Location 4869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4869))

- All this comes to a head, for Pharisees in particular (and for Saul of Tarsus above all, granted his subsequent history), when we put monotheism and election together with eschatology.415 There is one future for God’s world, the future when God will do what he promised in the Prophets and the Psalms, and bring to completion the great story in which the world had been living, the story to which Israel had the clue in its scriptures. When that happens, when the ‘age to come’ arrives, God will judge the wicked and vindicate his people, bringing to birth his sovereign and healing rule in the renewed cosmos, raising the righteous dead to new bodily life so that they can share this new world – indeed, so that they may share in running it.416 This is what the world, the entire cosmos, has been waiting for. This is the true ‘apocalyptic’ expectation of second-Temple Jews. It was not the dualistic expectation of a world destroyed and a people rescued into a non-spatio-temporal ‘salvation’. Nor was it the ‘invasion’ of the cosmos from outside, without reference to any previous story. It was the creational-monotheist expectation of creation rescued and healed and, within that, of Israel vindicated at last.417 Granted the status of humans within creational monotheism, humans would have to be put right if creation was to be put right. Granted the status of Israel within election, itself the solution to the problem within creational monotheism, Israel would have to be put right if humans were to be put right. What is to be ‘revealed’ in the great coming apocalypse, seen from within the second-Temple Jewish world, would therefore be the way in which Israel, and thence humanity, and thence creation itself, were to be put right. The apparent complexities of Paul’s theology are the direct result of his wrestling simultaneously with these interlocking, Russian-doll like questions from his own new angle of vision, the angle given to him in the events concerning Jesus.

- If second-Temple Jews believed that the creator God, the lord of the covenant, was going to do all this, the question then presses: how could one tell, in the present, who were ‘the righteous’, the ones who would be found to be on God’s side on the great coming day, the ones who would inherit ‘the coming age’? This is how the question which much later theology has rendered so abstract and timeless – the question of ‘justification’ and, beyond that, of ‘salvation’ itself as conceived within western theology – comes into focus in actual first-century discourse. Having said that, we are bound to find it frustrating that we have almost no texts from this period that do what we would like, namely, speak from a clearly Pharisaic point of view about what Paul the apostle calls ‘justification by works of the law’.

- The closest we get, as is well known, is the Essene document 4QMMT. Though this document arguably criticizes the Pharisees, it appears to share, so far as we can tell, a sense of the shape of how eschatology works in relation to election and thus to present justification, enabling us to make the substitution of Pharisaic elements for Essene ones in the hope that we will thereby come closer to the answer.418 The point can be summarized thus. First, God will soon bring the whole world into judgment, at which point some people will be ‘reckoned in the right’, as Abraham and Phinehas were. Second, there are particular things, even in the present time, which will function as signs of that coming verdict. Third, those particular things are naturally enough the things that mark out loyal Israelites from disloyal ones; in other words (remember Mattathias!) strong, zealous adherence to Torah and covenant. Fourth, as a result, those who perform these things in the present time can thus be assured that the verdict to be issued in the future, when the age to come is finally launched, can already be known, can be anticipated, in the present. This, I believe, is what a first-century Pharisee would have meant by ‘justification by the… ([Location 4897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4897))

- There are two different fragmentary scrolls that supply the final lines of MMT.

Reflect on all these matters, and seek from him that he may support your counsel and keep far from you the evil scheming and the counsel of Belial, so that at the end of time, you may rejoice in finding that these selected words of ours are true. And it shall be reckoned to you as righteousness, when you do what is upright and good before him, for your good and that of Israel.422 This is the eschatological scheme the writer has in mind: a. at the ‘end of time’ or the ‘end of days’, the new day spoken of in Deuteronomy 30, the day of renewal and ‘return from exile’, God will judge the whole world, ‘reckoning righteousness to’ (that is, vindicating as in a lawcourt) his true people as genuine covenant members; b. the people who will thus be vindicated at the end are the ones who will have been loyal to him, to Torah, to the covenant, in the present; c. loyalty now consists of… ([Location 4917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4917))

- The Pharisees, we judge from the apparently anti-Pharisaic polemic of MMT, would not have agreed with this particular ‘selection of works of Torah’. But the eschatological shape of the doctrine is becoming more and more recognizable. How would this work out? First, the Pharisee would see the great, ultimate division in humankind as being between Israel and the nations. Israel, the chosen people of the creator God, would be vindicated at the last day: ‘All Israel has a share in the age to come.’423 But how is Israel marked out as ‘age to come’ people in advance of that day? Answer, obviously: through Torah, given to the whole people. How does Torah mark Israel out from the nations? Answer, again obviously: keeping the law in general, but particularly the distinctive laws of sabbath, food and circumcision. If you do these, you will be able to see already, in advance of the eschaton, who God’s ultimate people really are, who will ‘inherit the age to come’. The Jewish people did often regard themselves as morally superior to the nations, but in our period this was symbolized graphically by the ‘works of Torah’ in the sense of sabbath, circumcision and food-laws. These were the badges one would wear. ‘Works of Torah’, in a fairly… ([Location 4933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4933))
- Second, it is clear from the whole Pharisaic project that, like Qumran but on different grounds, the Pharisees made sharp distinctions between themselves and the large multitude of Jews whom they regarded as (in varying degrees) compromised, assimilated, or otherwise insufficiently serious in their Torah-practice. If we know anything about the early Pharisaic movement, and specially the movement as it exists in the time of Saul of Tarsus, we know that the Pharisees were busily developing their own oral Torah, making the biblical laws more precise, more specific and relevant to every conceivable situation. That is the project which reaches one climax with the Mishnah and then goes on to its successors, the Talmudim and their associated literatures. At this level the ‘works of Torah’ might include particular Pharisaic interpretations, and it would then be a question between different Pharisees as to whether this or that one would ultimately matter in terms of ‘inheriting the age to come’. After all, no sooner has the Mishnah declared that ‘all Israel has a share in the age to come’ than it provides a list of exceptions: not the resurrection-deniers (in other words, the Sadducees), not those who deny the divine origin of Torah, and not ‘an Epicurean’.424 There follows a further set of lists, of biblical characters and groups whose chance of inheriting the age to come is debated.425 Here, therefore, there is a line drawn not just between Jews and others but within the company of Jews themselves. A hard-line Pharisee might well say, ‘Now we really know who will inherit the age to come, and how we can be clear about that in the present time. It is not enough (though it is essential) to keep the biblical laws which separate us from the nations; we must also keep the oral laws which bring Torah into every detail of life, which enable us to be zealous and loyal in our own day, and which will separate us Pharisees from the compromised assimilators who think of themselves as Jews but are denying that status by their deeds.’ We Pharisees can, in other words, anticipate the final divine verdict, the judgment… ([Location 4944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4944))

- A further line could perhaps be drawn between the Pharisaic schools of Paul’s day. It is well known that the debates between the Hillelites and Shammaites could become heated, yet they did not for the most part attempt to put one another out of the assembly or warn one another that to follow their line might result in not inheriting the age to come. But the tolerance of stricter and more lenient opinions among different Pharisaic groups was not extended to the groups just mentioned, Sadducees, sceptics and the immoral. We may therefore suppose (supposition is all we have, in the absence of direct evidence, but this is where all the lines of evidence converge) that a first-century Pharisee like Saul of Tarsus would have seen the picture like this: a. In the ‘age to come’, the creator God will judge the wicked (pagans, and renegade Jews), and will vindicate (= declare ‘righteous’) his people (i.e. will declare that they are part of his ‘all Israel’). b. The present marks of this vindicated/justified people will be the things which show their loyalty to their God and their zeal for his covenant. c. These things are, more precisely, the true keeping of Torah: (a) keeping the ‘works’ which mark out Jews from their pagan neighbours, and (b) keeping the ‘works’ which mark out good, observant Jews from non-observant – in extreme cases, the sceptics and the wicked, though there might be other more fine-tuned categories as well.426 d. You can therefore tell in the present who will be ‘vindicated’ in the future, because they are those who keep ‘the works of Torah’ in this way in the present time. I have spelled this out at some length for rather obvious reasons to do with our preparation for understanding the mindset, and the particular thought-patterns, of one Pharisee in particular. As has become clear, I see what might be called ‘the doctrine of justification’ having its nest at the interface between election and eschatology. Both remain dependent on creational monotheism. It is the responsibility of the creator to put the world right at the last; a basically linear history moving towards that goal of ‘judgment’ (in the sense, as in Psalms 96 and 98, of ‘putting everything right’) is itself part of that sort of monotheism. Within that linear history, the particular story which Israel told about itself (and, within that, the specific forms of that story which we… ([Location 4964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=4964))

- But it is not only the glory of YHWH himself that is to be restored in the coming new age when God brings his judgment and mercy to bear on the world afresh. It is also the glory of humankind. In a theme particularly noticeable in the Dead Sea Scrolls, we find promises that ‘all the glory of Adam’ shall belong to the penitent, and/or the righteous, within Israel.434 This belongs of course to the ancient Jewish notion of humankind made in the creator’s image, made to reflect this God not only back to God but also out into God’s world. ‘The glory of Adam’ seems to include the dominion, the stewardship, exercised by Adam over all God’s creation. This theme remains in parallel, almost in tension, with the theme of the final revelation of God’s own personal glory. I do not think that second-Temple Jews found a way to bring them together.

- There is, however, a pointer towards an integration of these two themes in some of the reflections about the coming Messiah. In 2 Samuel 7 David proposes to build a house for YHWH, but he is told that instead YHWH will build him a ‘house’.435 Playing on the double meaning of the word ‘house’, the king’s intention to build a physical temple where the glory of YHWH can dwell for ever is trumped, superseded one might say, by the promise that God will give David a son to sit on his throne, a son who will turn out to be God’s own son. But how can this be an answer to David’s intention, that there will be a permanent place for God to dwell among his people? Only if, in some sense, the coming king will be the reality towards which the Temple will turn out to be a mere signpost. Somehow, the king will be the place where, and the means by which, the living God comes to dwell among his people.

- How are these passages, or rather the underlying theme of YHWH’s glory and other attributes spreading out from the Temple into the rest of the cosmos, understood or developed in the Jewish world of Paul’s day – and perhaps particularly in Pharisaic circles? For a start (a long way from the world of the Pharisees!), there is Philo. In line with the passage we saw a moment ago, he declares that the Jewish people in whose lives the ‘angels and words’ are active have the chance to be a house of God, a holy temple, a highly beautiful dwelling-place; for, just possibly, the one who is the whole world’s Householder, and yours as well, will watch over you as his special house, to keep you for ever under his protection, safe from harm.444 ([Location 5075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=5075))

- Once again Beale, following Walton, sees a regular theme here. The purpose of creation, with Adam and Eve told to work in the garden which was the place of the divine presence, was that they should extend that garden out into the rest of the world, taking the divine presence with them.445 This theme comes to expression in David’s preparations for the building of the Temple, where he praises the God of Israel for being sovereign over the heavens and the earth.446 Ezekiel’s promises of a new Temple explicitly evoke the Eden theme, indicating the creator’s intention to make his name known throughout the world.447 The eschatological promises towards the end of Isaiah link the glorious new state of Jerusalem with the promise of new heavens and new earth.448 Zechariah speaks of a coming huge Temple, without walls, because YHWH himself will be the wall, and ‘the glory in her midst’, whereupon Israel will spread out across the world. ‘Israel, as a corporate Adam, must spread out to subdue the earth and fill it with [God’s] glory.’449 The ‘stone’ in Daniel 2 can be read the same way, as the foundation stone of the new Temple which then becomes the mountain that fills the whole earth, displacing the blasphemous statue that was there before.450 ([Location 5082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=5082))
- The evidence is clear if not massive; but it is enough to show that at least some second-Temple readers of scripture picked up the hints already there that the promise concerning the eventual new Temple would join up with the promise of YHWH’s returning glory, and that both together would fulfil the otherwise puzzling repeated scriptural promise that YHWH’s glory would then fill the whole earth.

- The Aims of a Zealous Pharisee Part of the answer to this question is easy; part is more controversial. The two outer limits are easy. First, personal purity. This has been sufficiently explored in many other places. Second, the ultimate goal of God’s coming fulfilment of his promises. The two join up: keeping Torah in the present is one of the means by which that goal will be reached, one of the signs that one belongs already to the age to come. For many Pharisees, maintaining personal purity to the required standard, and working in whatever way possible for the coming of God’s kingdom, will have been the main aims of one’s life. If there were substantial Pharisaic communities in the Diaspora as well as in the holy land itself, which is disputed, then the Torah will have loomed even larger, making up for being away from the Temple.453 In such a case, as well, Torah-observance was likewise accentuated because this was what enabled the ‘wall’ to be maintained between God’s people and the idolatrous pagan world.454 ([Location 5108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=5108))

- For some, however, there may have been two other aims as well. As we shall see towards the end of this book, it is characteristic of Jewish approaches to suppose that the world is to be put right and that for this to happen something needs to be done. First, Philo makes it quite clear that a strong part of the Pharisees’ aim was not just to try to influence other, non-Pharisaic, Jews, but to put considerable pressure on them to shape up, to approximate to their own high levels of purity, as best they could. Discussing what divine vengeance would do to someone who swears falsely, Philo envisages the possibility that such a person might evade human punishments, but then says that actually even that is unlikely because there are thousands of zealots keeping watch and ready to take action. ([Location 5117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=5117))
- It is highly likely, in view of this and other evidence, that many Pharisees, and certainly those who saw themselves as especially ‘zealous’ for ‘the teachings of the ancestors’, will have occupied themselves in trying to bring less enthusiastic lawkeepers into line. Philo’s statement can hardly only have applied in Jerusalem itself. We may perhaps infer from it that there were such people in Alexandria in his day, and if there then possibly elsewhere in the Diaspora too.

- But did Jews, particularly Pharisees, go looking for such people? The debate has swung this way and that over the last couple of decades, and the most recent contributions, once all the appropriate checks and balances have been allowed for, conclude that by and large they did not. The Pharisees were ready to accept and even encourage people who wanted to join, but mostly they expected gentiles to come to them (this was, after all, what the prophets had indicated458) rather than for them to have to go out searching for them.459 It is possible that different Jewish communities in different parts of the Diaspora took different lines; some have suggested that the Jewish community in Rome was more active than others.460 One Jewish writer has even speculated that the origins of Paul’s missionary impulse must have lain in the pagan practices of going around to encourage people to worship Osiris, Hercules or whoever, on the grounds that there were no models within the Jewish world for what he seems to have done.461 This, as we shall see, is an unnecessary if curiously interesting hypothesis. I accept what seems to be the majority view: most Jews, and most Pharisees, did not routinely mount missions to go looking for potential proselytes. All history is full of exceptions, and ancient history full of gaps; Matthew 23 may perhaps have a case in mind now lost to us. But we have no particular reason to suppose that the young Saul of Tarsus went off hunting for gentiles. His missionary impulse came from quite a different source.

- The worldview of a first-century Pharisee has thus come into focus. Living somewhere on the spectrum between the extreme and possibly violent zeal of the ardent Shammaite and the extreme and possibly flexible caution of the ardent Hillelite, the Pharisee was passionately concerned about the ancestral traditions, particularly the law of Moses and the development of that into oral law, and about the importance of keeping this double Torah not simply because it was required, or in order to earn the divine favour, but because a renewed keeping of the law with all one’s heart and soul was one of the biblically stated conditions (as in Deuteronomy 30) for the great renewal, the eschaton and all that it would mean. It was what constituted the appropriate and faithful response to the faithfulness of Israel’s God, invoking the protection of the divine bird hovering over Jerusalem. Personal piety, and personal hope, were firmly held within the ongoing story of the life and hope of Israel as a whole. The controlling stories, fleshed out in symbol and praxis, gave the essential body to the theological soul of monotheism, election and eschatology.

- None of this was merely about ideas, about figuring out a consistent way of speaking about God, about Israel, about the future. The Pharisaic worldview embraced the whole of reality. It was not simply about ‘religion’, whether in the ancient or the modern senses. It included a ‘wisdom’, an understanding of the world and of its creator, which belonged with what the ancients thought of as ‘philosophy’. It included a community-oriented agenda which belonged with ‘politics’. That is why, if we are to understand Paul the apostle, we must see him within this rich, many-sided world.

- Questions demand time, and time is conquest’s gift to moneyed scholars. To Athens, then, they came, searching, searching, for wisdom, virtue, truth; to see what others, stumbling in darkness, could not see. Athene welcomed them; and, as symbol for their quest, the master of night-vision, at her side, bestowed his owlish blessing on their labours. Owls were to Athens what (in the proverb from my own world) coals were to Newcastle. The Little Owl, common throughout the region, likes to nest in buildings, and a natural spot could be found in the rafters of the Parthenon, the enormous Temple of Athene on the Acropolis, still there today to look down on traffic fumes and currency crises. The same bird, chosen as the city’s symbol, glinted up at ancient Athenians from their silver coins, mined and minted just down the road. The owl, whether feathered or silvered, was so obviously a local product that bringing more from elsewhere would be pointless.1 ([Location 6262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6262))

- Athene was regularly (if perhaps misleadingly) identified with the Roman goddess Minerva, who borrowed the bird as well as the role: ‘Minerva’s owl’ has remained proverbial as the symbol of philosophy in general. Hegel, no doubt with a twist of dialectic in mind, turned the owl’s positive significance (seeing in the dark) into a negative one, invoking the bird as a sign that philosophy can be wise only after the event. ‘The owl of Minerva’, he wrote, ‘begins its flight only with the onset of dusk.’3 ([Location 6273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6273))

- The technical names for these topics serve as a warning to modern readers. Key words can subtly change their meanings. ‘What is there’ is physics, the study of physis, nature. Today’s ‘physics’ is much narrower, excluding biology, botany, chemistry and so forth and also, more especially, theology and metaphysics, things which, if they are in some sense ‘there’, seem to be of a different order entirely. For the ancient Greeks, however, ‘physics’ covered all of that and more: ‘everything that is’, in fact – a huge, sprawling category, including quite specifically what became known as ‘metaphysics’, which in turn included the study of the gods and their relation to the world.

- A major disruption in this line of philosophical teaching and debate in Athens came in the two-year period 88–86 BC. Mithradates VI, king of Pontus in northern Asia Minor, was Rome’s most dangerous enemy at the time. Having overrun most of the lands around the Black Sea, he proceeded to gain control of Bithynia and Cappadocia as well. He then provoked war with Rome by massacring Romans and Italians living in the province of Asia, and followed this by seizing control of most of Greece. At this point the wise owls of Athens looked into the dark and made the wrong choice.5 Two philosophers held absolute power (by turns) in Athens at this juncture, but Plato’s ideal structure of ‘philosopher kings’, steering a city in the right direction, crumbled away in their hands. Athenion, from the Peripatetic (Aristotelian) school, and Aristion, an Epicurean, both decided to go with Mithradates and against Rome. Rome then did what Rome did best. Five legions arrived, with Sulla at their head. They defeated Mithradates,… ([Location 6301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6301))

- One of Paul’s key self-descriptions is ‘apostle of the nations’, apostolos ethnōn.10 Entire schools of New Testament interpretation have been built up on the assumption that, following his conversion, Saul of Tarsus developed a system of thought which was essentially designed to abandon Jewish categories (‘law’, ‘Messiah’, and so forth) and offer Jesus to the gentile world as a new kyrios, ‘lord’, on the analogy with the ‘lords’ of the cults of the day. We have described this briefly elsewhere and will discuss it further when the larger picture of Paul has been constructed.11 But for the moment, taking our cue from what appears to be self-evidently Paul’s own summary of his gospel and theology, we may propose instead that what Paul thought he was doing was offering an essentially Jewish message to the pagan world: The Messiah became a servant of the circumcised people in order to demonstrate the truthfulness of God – that is, to confirm the promises to the patriarchs, and to bring the nations to praise God for his mercy.12 ([Location 6331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6331))

- following verses (Romans 15.9–13) explain the point. There is no sense that one would have to abandon Jewish and biblical categories in order to have something to say to the wider world. It is a central part of Israel’s scriptures that the God of Israel intends to summon the nations of the world to worship and serve him. As we shall see, a central feature of Paul’s gospel and theology is the claim that, with the resurrection of the Messiah, the moment for this fresh worldwide summons has arrived.13 ([Location 6340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6340))
- First, there is direct confrontation; perhaps the most vivid examples are in the realm of Jewish-style monotheism as it confronts pagan polytheism, and Jewish-style sexual ethics in contrast to the practices of the pagans.15 But second, there is adaptation. Here again we have a programmatic Pauline statement: ‘we take every thought prisoner,’ he declares, ‘and make it obey the Messiah.’ This is not simply a cavalier attitude, grabbing anything that looks useful. It is based on Paul’s robust creational monotheism: all the wisdom of the world belongs to Jesus the Messiah in the first place, so any flickers or glimmers of light, anywhere in the world, are to be used and indeed celebrated within the exposition of the gospel.16 ([Location 6349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6349))

Baur from the middle of the nineteenth century or E. P. Sanders from the last quarter of the twentieth, the controlling assumption has been that Paul was proclaiming and teaching something which we can fairly straightforwardly call ‘religion’.

- We know quite a lot about pagan ‘religion’ in Paul’s day.17 It involved temples and sacrifices; auspices and oracles; a priesthood which overlapped considerably with the local aristocracy; a close integration with the life of the polis. It assumed the existence, and the moody unpredictability, of the traditional pantheon of deities, and particularly of the local or tribal deity peculiar to the city or region. It might include particular cults, ‘mysteries’ into which one might be ‘initiated’, thereby gaining a new (secret) religious status in the present and the promise of a blissful post-mortem existence. Such ‘religion’, both at the public and private level, was usually capable of accommodating other divinities. As groups and individuals migrated around the ancient near east, this resulted in complex, criss-crossing varieties of local ‘religions’ in any one place (in which, for instance, newly arrived gods and goddesses might take the names and… ([Location 6364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6364))

But the Christians offered no animal sacrifices; they had no sacred precincts or cult functionaries; they did not make pilgrimages to Delphi or anywhere else in search of divine advice. They assumed (as Jews did) the non-existence of the traditional pantheon, and of the local or tribal deities.

- What is more, from Paul onwards the Christians did three things which in the ancient world would have been associated, not with ‘religion’, but precisely with philosophy.20 First, they presented a case for a different order of reality, a divine reality which cut across the normal assumptions. They told stories about a creator God and the world, stories which had points of intersection with things that the pagans said about god(s) and the world but which started and finished in different places and included necessary but unprecedented elements in the middle. Second, they argued for, and themselves modelled, a particular way of life, a way which would before long be a cause of remark, sometimes curious and sometimes hostile, among their neighbours.21 Third, they constructed and maintained communities which ignored the normal ties of kinship, local or geographical identity, or language – not to mention gender or class. As a result, again starting with Paul, they received rough treatment at the hands of civic authorities. We do not hear of people in the ancient world being thrown out of cities for practising mainstream ‘religion’.22 On the contrary: ‘religion’ was what kept the wheels of the state (the city or country) turning in the right direction. We do hear, frequently, of civic authorities banishing philosophers, or even putting them to death: Socrates is the most obvious example.23 That is why the more likely translation of hetaeriai in Pliny’s letter is not ‘religious associations’ but (as in the Loeb translation) political associations.24 From this vantage point, it begins to look as though the entire… ([Location 6383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6383))

- one of the big differences between the ancient Greco-Roman world and our own is that today the word ‘philosophy’ is regularly used for a somewhat recondite academic discipline. In Paul’s day, however, ‘philosophy’ covered the sort of things that a reasonably well educated person might expect to discuss over a meal with friends, or in a letter. There were technical terms and various developed ideas, but ‘philosophy’ in general was a much more street-level activity than it would be for us. To think of Paul as in some sense a ‘philosopher’ is therefore not to suppose him appealing only to a highbrow or (in our unpleasant modern sense) elite audience. It meant that he was addressing the culture and thought-forms of his day on topics of importance and controversy.

- a task is way beyond the scope of the present volume, but it is important to register it in case we give the impression that Paul’s thought floated about in a world only of ‘ideas’.28 Anything but. He was, and remained, a Jew. And Jewish ‘thought’ has almost always been umbilically related to the concrete world of people and places, actions and artefacts, practice and performance. The same was true of some ancient philosophies, notably Stoicism. Whatever Paul meant by ‘justification by faith’ (we shall come to that later), there is no reason to suppose, though many have supposed it, that he was thereby advocating a Christian variation on philosophical idealism, privileging the abstract (‘faith’) over the concrete (‘works’). Paul, we may safely say, was not a Platonist. ([Location 6430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6430))

- First, even if we take Acts 22.3 strictly, it is not clear at what age it implies that Paul moved from Tarsus to Jerusalem. ‘Brought up’ might mean ‘from babyhood’, but it could equally refer to Paul’s teenage years, leaving him plenty of time, as a bright young boy, to pick up questions and discussions that were all around in the bustling Greco-Roman city. There are many twelve-year-olds in university towns today who become cheerfully familiar with the topics of the time, whether or not they go on to take a degree.

- Second, Acts also informs us that, following his conversion, Saul visited Jerusalem and, after causing disturbances through his debates with ‘the Hellenists’, was packed off back home to Tarsus, staying there for some years until Barnabas invited him to come and join in the work he was doing in Antioch in Syria.30 Granted that Saul had gone back to his home town fired with the dangerous message that a recently crucified Jew was Israel’s Messiah and the world’s true Lord, and granted all we know of his character before and after, we are bound to assume that he engaged with thinkers and scholars in Tarsus at all kinds of levels. ([Location 6446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6446))
- Thus, even if he had been taken to Jerusalem in infancy, which is by no means necessarily implied by Acts 22.3, Saul’s early post-conversion stay in Tarsus allows plenty of time, not indeed to ‘translate’ his initial ‘Jewish’ understanding of the news about Jesus into a very different and ‘hellenistic’ mode of thought – as we shall see, there is no reason to suppose he ever did that – but certainly for him to bump up against the major philosophical traditions of the time and to begin to work out not only possible points of convergence but also key points where confrontation or subversion would be appropriate. I regard it as highly probable that it was in this early time in Tarsus that he began to acquire the art of ‘tearing down clever arguments, and every proud notion that sets itself up against the knowledge of God’, resulting in his project of ‘taking every thought prisoner and making it obey the Messiah’.31 ([Location 6451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6451))

- And we remind ourselves, in particular, that in popular culture what one is most likely to encounter is not a carefully designed construction of whatever sort. If we think of the major schools of the day as being like the four suits in a pack of cards, what one meets on the street is not all four neatly laid out in a row, but the philosophical equivalent of a disorderly heap of cards on a table, some of which look very like others. The two of spades and the two of clubs appear to have more in common than either might do with their respective kings or queens.

- The four ‘suits’ might then stand for the four main philosophical schools of Paul’s day: the Academy (a development from Plato’s ‘Academy’, but with some fresh emphases); the Lyceum (a development from Aristotle’s ‘Peripatetic’ school); the Stoics; and the Epicureans. If we stretch the metaphor just a little, we might suggest that the Cynics were the jokers in the pack, which is happily true in that, if one wants a smile out of ancient philosophy, it is to the Cynics that one might first turn. Equally, it is only partially true. The Cynics were, if anything, a kind of edgy and extreme variety of Stoicism, and indeed Zeno, the founder of the Stoics, was himself influenced by early Cynics such as Diogenes. Stretching and twisting the metaphor even further, one can imagine a group of people in the corner of the room, refusing to have anything to do with the game, declaring that one cannot be sure just what these ‘suits’ actually are, or whether or not aces are to be high or low.

- Aristotle came from northern Greece, and returned there after Plato’s death to act as tutor to the young Alexander of Macedon (much as, in the first century AD, Seneca would be tutor to Nero). He returned to Athens in 335, but instead of throwing in his lot with the followers of his old teacher, he set up his own philosophical school in the Lyceum, outside Athens’s city wall. Twelve years later (323) the death of Alexander generated an anti-Macedonian reaction in Athens which forced Aristotle to leave the city in a hurry. He died the next year. After Aristotle’s death his followers, under the leadership of Theophrastus, became known as the ‘Peripatetic’ school, due to their habit of walking to and fro while discussing.

- Whereas Plato seems to us constantly to be pushing towards greater and greater abstraction, Aristotle usually appears to be moving in the opposite direction, towards greater and greater fine-tuned distinction between different objects, different animals, different motivations, different beliefs. He collects, analyzes and categorizes, probing with sharp and questing intelligence areas as diverse as biology and aesthetics, music and metaphysics, showing, if not exceeding, Plato’s concern with abstraction. He is particularly famous for his development of logic, notably the syllogism (‘all sheep are animals; all animals feed and die; therefore all sheep feed and die’), which he developed in order to move securely and on strict rational principles from truths already established to conclusions otherwise unreachable.

- Aristotle opposed Plato’s theory of ‘Forms’, believing that the ‘universals’ (whether a colour like ‘blue’, the ‘universal’ reality behind or beneath all actual blue objects, or a quality like ‘goodness’, the reality behind all good actions) only existed in their concrete manifestations. One may wonder to what extent this was partly a matter of bent: Plato seems the more intuitive thinker, always reaching for the big picture, and then for a bigger one again, whereas Aristotle seems to revel in getting his hands dirty with the analysis of this animal, this musical sequence, this facet of human character. We can imagine Plato doing most of his work through reflection and discussion, but Aristotle could not have produced a fraction of the work he did unless, in addition to strolling around discussing things with his followers, he had spent long hours actually studying the natural world.

- Since the purpose of the present abbreviated survey is to sketch the philosophical context of the young Saul of Tarsus and the mature Paul the apostle, it is important to note that in the first century the writings of Plato and Aristotle were not merely a distant memory (as far from his time, more or less, as Copernicus and Calvin are from ours). The first century BC saw a remarkable revival of Aristotle’s teaching; his treatises were arranged, edited and commented upon. ‘Philosophy’ thus began not merely to look for answers but to study ‘canonical’ texts. Nicolaus of Damascus, friend and advisor to Herod the Great, as well as friend and biographer to Augustus – as well as tutor to the children of Antony and Cleopatra! – wrote paraphrases of, and commentaries on, Aristotle’s works. Plato, too, enjoyed a considerable revival at the same time, following the refounding of the Academy after the Roman destruction in 88 BC. One of the most notable exponents of Platonism in or shortly after the time of Paul was the philosopher and biographer Plutarch, who for many years combined remarkable literary activity with holding the office of priest at the important shrine of Apollo at Delphi.42 Nor were Plato and Aristotle the only older philosophers to find their way back into favour. Another would be Pythagoras.43 ([Location 6562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6562))

- By Paul’s day Epicureanism had received its most thorough exposition in the form of the great poem of Lucretius (c.94–55 BC), who clothed his master’s thought in Latin poetry of powerful beauty. But there is no hint in Paul of any engagement with this or any related work.48 The closest we come is the famous Areopagus speech in Acts 17, following (as Luke reports) conversations in the market-place at Athens with Epicureans as well as Stoics. About this we must speak later on.49 ([Location 6601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6601))

- The name ‘Stoic’ comes from stoa, a ‘porch’ or cloister, since Zeno established his school in the Stoa Poikilē, the ‘painted cloister’ in Athens. But by Paul’s day, though Stoicism was certainly still taught there, it was equally well known in Rome, Alexandria, and many other centres including Tarsus itself. Here is perhaps the most important thing in this chapter for today’s readers of Paul to take to heart. Whereas the default mode of most modern westerners is some kind of Epicureanism, the default mode for many of Paul’s hearers was some kind of Stoicism. Observing the differences between the two, particularly at the level of assumptions, is therefore vital if we are to ‘hear’ Paul as many of his first hearers might have done. If, when someone says the word ‘god’, we think at once of a distant, detached divinity – as most modern westerners, being implicitly Epicureans or at least Deists,51 are likely to do – we are unlikely to be able imaginatively to inhabit the world of many in Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus and elsewhere for whom the word ‘god’ might reasonably be expected to denote the divinity which indwelt, through its fiery physical presence, all things, all people, the whole cosmos.

- Stoicism, after all, was the classic form of pantheism, the doctrine that sees divinity in everything. Saying this to someone today might appear to suggest that ‘everything’ is therefore in its essence ‘spiritual’, pointing back to some kind of Platonic vision of a ‘real’ world beyond space, time and matter. Stoicism, however, went in the opposite direction: everything, including the divine force or presence indwelling all things and all people, was ‘material’ or ‘corporeal’, not far from what we would normally call ‘physical’ (though all these terms are slippery with age and varied usage). The logos, the ‘creative reason’, was the ‘active principle’ which acted upon ordinary matter, the ‘passive principle’ (hylē). But… ([Location 6618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6618))
- So, too, the ‘spirit’, the pneuma, was a ‘corporeal’ substance, again like fiery breath, working within what we think of as solid bodies. Indeed, in much Stoic thought there is a fluidity between the logos, which pervades all things, and the pneuma, the inner vitality which made something what it really was. Furthermore, tellingly, either the logos or the pneuma, or both, can actually be spoken of as ‘the divine’, to theion, or even as Zeus himself, ruler and lord of all that is.53 Whereas in early Christian thinking, especially that of Paul, the pneuma was associated especially with the transformation of human life, for the Stoics the pneuma was a key concept in areas such as biology and physics, turning up in inanimate… ([Location 6625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6625))

- Since everything, including humans, was thus indwelt by the logos and/or the pneuma, the central imperative for human life was to live as much as possible in harmonious accord with this inner divine principle, whether it be thought of simply as living in accordance with the nature of the universe (with Cleanthes) or as living in accordance also with the true human nature (with Chrysippus).54 This meant the resolute development of character, pursuing the Stoic version of Aristotle’s virtues.55 That was the only thing worth striving for, since the accidents of health and wealth were irrelevant to true happiness (though, unlike the Cynics who renounced all possessions except a bare minimum, the Stoics did not object to accumulating wealth, and indeed reputation, if occasion afforded).56 The aim of the Stoic was to engage in a progress of continual moral enlightenment, with the goal of becoming a ‘sage’, a truly wise, well-formed character, able to live in accordance with ‘nature’ (kata physin) in this divine sense, becoming self-sufficient (autarkēs), impervious to the nasty tricks which life can play.57 This is what constitutes true… ([Location 6633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6633))

- It is basic to Stoic belief that, though the senses can deceive, there are certain fundamental ‘cognitive impressions’ (katalēptikai phantasiai) which can be utterly trusted. From them – and this is the purpose of ‘logic’, of learning the virtue of proper reasoning – one can move to larger and wider conclusions. This is well expressed by Cicero: ‘as our previous conclusions are undoubtedly true and well established’, he has Cato say at one point, ‘and as these are the logical inferences from them, the truth of these inferences also cannot be called in question.’60 The art of sifting these inferences, of working by ‘logic’ through the proper steps, was called ‘dialectic’, and Cicero at least regards this as a virtue because it conveys a method that guards us from giving assent to any falsehood or ever being deceived by specious probability, and enables us to retain and to defend the truths that we have learned about good and evil; for… ([Location 6646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6646))

- Armed with this tool of reasoning, the Stoic system boldly maps out its basic view of the world. Since the world as a whole is, for the Stoic, the manifestation of the divine, it is out of the question to suppose that something can be seriously wrong with it. One cannot be both a pantheist and a dualist. (This contrasts sharply with classic Epicureanism, which points out the glaring faults in the world as evidence that it cannot have been made by the gods.62) If, therefore, someone supposes that there is something importantly wrong with the way things are, the proper approach is either to rise above it or, failing that, to take up the option readily available, and commit suicide. Epictetus (see below) frequently recommends this to people who decide they can no longer stand the world, or life, as it is. All things are in any case moving in their pre-ordained direction.

- The Stoics then developed their famous belief in world history as a sequence of great cycles. At one level, this is a way of coping, within pantheism, with the fact of time, change and history: how can to pan, ‘the all’, be subject to such things? The answer is that the fiery logos or pneuma which inhabits and acts upon the passive matter of the world is slowly but surely expanding and developing to the point where it has its way with the whole universe, turning it all into an extension of its fiery self in a great conflagration (ekpyrōsis) in which the deity ‘at stated periods of time absorbs into himself the whole of substance and again creates it from himself.’64 In view of today’s interest, in some quarters, in a coming ‘Armageddon’ in which the world as we know it would be destroyed, it is important to stress that the ‘conflagration’ expected by the Stoics was not the ‘destruction’ of the cosmos, as though the world were a bad thing that the gods would want to get rid of. It was, rather, a kind of ‘apotheosis’, in which the cosmos would at last be turned into the fiery substance which was itself the full, powerful divinity.

- Who or what, then, was ‘god’, or ‘the gods’, within this major and highly influential system? Stoic ‘theology’ forms part of ‘physics’, the description and analysis of that which is there.69 It is integrated with the rest both of ‘physics’ and of ‘ethics’, since as in most philosophical systems the constant implication was that humans should be as like ‘god’ or ‘the gods’ as possible.

- The deity, say they, is a living being (zōon), immortal, rational (logikon), perfect or intelligent in happiness, admitting nothing evil [into him], taking providential care of the world and all that therein is, but he is not of human shape. He is, however, the artificer of the universe and, as it were, the father of all, both in general and in that particular part of him which is all-pervading, and which is called many names according to its various power. They give the name Dia because all things are due to (dia) him; Zeus (Zēna) in so far as he is the cause of life (zēn) or pervades all life; the name Athena is given, because the ruling part of the divinity extends to the aether; the name Hera marks its extension to the air (aera); he is called Hephaestus since it spreads to the creative fire; Poseidon, since it stretches to the sea; Demeter, since it reaches to the earth. Similarly men have given the deity his other titles, fastening, as best they can, on some one or other of his peculiar attributes.

- This shows clearly enough what is going on: Stoic pantheism presents itself as a kind of grown-up and reflective version of ordinary paganism. That which earlier and unreflective people had seen as different divine forces were in fact among the multiple facets of the one God. Zeus and his associates in Greece, Jupiter and his colleagues in Rome, were all to be regarded as variegated manifestations of the one ‘divinity’ which permeated all things.71 As Michael White points out, even in the case of all the varied technical terms used to denote the divine – fire, spirit, god, mind, seed or whatever – ‘a difference in linguistic expressions does not correspond to a difference in the referents of those expressions.’72 In the passage quoted above, Diogenes Laertius provides fanciful etymological links between various divine beings and their sphere of responsibility (Athena and the aether, for example), and for others a more direct link in terms of the usual sphere of operations (as, for instance, with Poseidon and the sea). But these are clearly surface-level window-dressing. The point is that everything that can be imagined as ‘divine’, right up to the entire world itself, is all part of the one entity, to pan.

- That is why, of course, Stoics are basically monotheists. If to pan, ‘the all’, is ‘divine’, there can only be one of it. But this did not stop many Stoics from referring to ‘the gods’, perhaps with the sense that the ‘gods’ of popular devotion were after all the kind of junior executives working under one chief deity, or alternatively that, like a sort of apotheosized Pooh-Bah, the one High God holds all the offices of state himself. There were, in fact, many thinkers in antiquity who articulated and embraced some form of ‘monotheism’, leading some later pagan apologists to grumble at the normal Christian line that the major difference between Christianity and paganism was that Christians believed in one divinity whereas pagans believed in many. This should not be pushed too far. A larger vision after which some philosophers might be feeling their way is not the same as what one finds on the street.73 But at least for the Stoics themselves it was quite easy to subsume the traditional gods, and hence the traditional devotion due to them, within the single framework of a pantheism, cosmic in scale and fiery in energy.

Enough of his work has survived (including particularly his remarkable ‘Moral Letters’) that he occupies ten volumes in the Loeb Classical Library, putting him in the same league as Philo or Josephus and not far behind Plato himself. He remains, in my judgment, one of the more attractive figures of an often murky period.

- Seneca is above all practical. He knows the theory, but what interests him most is how it works out in the everyday challenges of the moral life. When faced with verbal trickery and philosophers’ puzzles, he has a simple challenge: Which of these word-games, he asks, will get rid of lust?87 His revealing hints about sensing the presence of the divine tells us a good deal about the sort of man he was: If ever you have come upon a grove that is full of ancient trees which have grown to an unusual height, shutting out a view of the sky by a veil of pleached and intertwining branches, then the loftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, and your marvel at the thick unbroken shade in the midst of the open spaces, will prove to you the presence of deity. If a cave, made by the deep crumbling of the rocks, holds up a mountain on its arch, a place not built with hands but hollowed out into such spaciousness by natural causes, your soul will be deeply moved by a certain intimation of the existence of God.88 ([Location 6776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6776))

- Musonius, hailed by some as ‘the Roman Socrates’, left no books as such, but a good many of his short sayings and essays are preserved.94 He taught, among other things, the equality of women, and the high importance of marriage and of a sexual ethic which supported it. He rejected violence, and at one point attempted to intervene in an armed conflict, trying to persuade the army of Vespasian, approaching Rome at the climax of the ‘Year of the Four Emperors’, that peace would be the better option. Musonius’s intervention is reported by Tacitus in the tone of voice of a newspaper editorial sneering at a fundamentalist preacher for rushing out in front of a tank: Mixing with the troops in their companies, [Musonius Rufus] now proceeded to lecture armed men on the blessings of peace and the dangers of war. Many of them laughed in his face, more still found him tedious, and a few were even ready to knock him down and stamp on him. But luckily the warnings of the best-behaved men and the threatening attitude of the rest induced him to abandon his untimely moralizing (intempestivam sapientiam).95 Musonius was regarded as sufficiently subversive to be banished from Rome on at least three occasions.96 He clearly made a great impression, for good or ill, on his contemporaries, continuing to teach cheerfully and to live by what he preached, even under considerable hardship. It is not surprising that he attracted many pupils, some of whom became famous in their own right, such as Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom (c. AD 40–120) and the younger Pliny.97 ([Location 6813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6813))

- Epictetus, more than any other whose writings have come down to us, exemplifies the ‘diatribe’ style, which emerges most obviously in the New Testament in some passages in Paul’s letter to the Romans. There are times, indeed, when it sounds as if Epictetus and Paul had grown up in the same street: What then? (ti oun) Do I say that man is an animal made for inactivity? Far be it from me! (mē genoito). But how can you say that we philosophers are not active in [public] affairs? For example, to take myself first: as soon as day breaks I call to mind briefly what author I must read over …102   What then? Is it we philosophers alone who take things easily and drowse? No, it is you young men far sooner. For, look you, we old men, when we see young men playing, are eager to join in the play ourselves. And much more, if I saw them wide-awake and eager to share in our studies, should I be eager to join, myself, in their serious pursuits.103 The subject-matter is of course different; but nobody who has an ear for Paul’s cadences, especially in letters like Romans and 1 Corinthians, can doubt that he and Epictetus were, to this extent, employing a very similar method of argument, which traced its ancestry back to Socrates and was to be located, within the disciplines of ancient philosophy, as part of ‘logic’. This was a way of ensuring that one was working steadily towards the truth, and not being deceived by faulty impressions or rhetorical trickery.

- One of the most striking things about Epictetus from the perspective of a potential comparison with Paul, however, is his remarkable sense of the presence and (what one is driven to call) personality of the god to whom he prayed. The gods (Epictetus seems happy to talk about them in the singular or the plural) are everywhere present, in us and with us, but there is also a sense in which humans are ‘children of Zeus’, since, though we share the physicality of our nature with the animals, we share reason and intelligence (logos and gnōmē) with the gods.104 As one commentator has put it, he offers ‘an almost incredible mixture of Theism, Pantheism, and Polytheism’,105 at one moment addressing the divinity much as in Christian prayer, at another acknowledging the omnipresence of the divine, and at another accepting quite happily the assumed polytheism of ordinary pagan religion. We are all, he says, ‘primarily begotten of God’, and this god is father not only of gods but of humans.106 ([Location 6858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6858))

- But this, says Epictetus, comes to a particular focus: He has stationed by each man’s side as guardian (epitropos) his particular genius (daimōn), – and has committed the man to his care, – and that too a guardian who never sleeps and is not to be beguiled … Wherefore, when you close your doors and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within, and your own genius is within … Yes, and to this God you also ought to swear allegiance, as the soldiers do to Caesar … Out there men swear never to prefer another in honour above Caesar; but here we swear to prefer ourselves in honour above everything else.109 The divinity, the daimōn, and one’s own self; it is not clear that Epictetus (or any other Stoic) offers an analysis of how these are all related.110 ([Location 6878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6878))

- Instead, declares the sage, we should pass our time in praise and worship; and if others will not do it, he, a lame old man, will do it for them. God, after all, has made humans to be not merely spectators of his works, but also interpreters; he calls them to be his witnesses.117 This gives rise to one of the most remarkable and noble expressions of gratitude for divine favour to be found anywhere outside the Judaeo-Christian tradition: Why, if we had sense, ought we to be doing anything else, publicly and privately, than hymning and praising the Deity (to theion), and rehearsing His benefits? Ought we not, as we dig and plough and eat, to sing the hymn of praise to God? ‘Great is God, that He hath furnished us these instruments wherewith we shall till the earth. Great is God, that He hath given us hands, and power to swallow, and a belly, and power to grow unconsciously, and to breathe while asleep.’ This is what we ought to sing on every occasion, and above all to sing the greatest and divinest hymn, that God has given us the faculty to comprehend these things and to follow the path of reason. What then? Since most of you have become blind, ought there not to be someone to fulfil this office for you, and in behalf of all sing the hymn of praise to God? Why, what else can I, a lame old man, do but sing hymns to God? If, indeed, I were a nightingale, I should be singing as a nightingale; if a swan, as a swan. But as it is, I am a rational being, therefore I must be singing hymns of praise to God (nyn de logikos eimi, hymnein me dei ton theon). This is my task; I do it, and will not desert this post, as long as it may be given me to fill it; and I exhort you to join me in this same song.118 ([Location 6900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6900))
- The result of all this – flying in the face of some recent suggestions to the contrary – is that, for Epictetus, the primary task of the would-be philosopher is in fact theology:119 Now the philosophers say that the first thing we must learn is this: That there is a God, and that He provides for the universe, and that it is impossible for a man to conceal from Him, not merely his actions, but even his purposes and his thoughts. Next we must learn what the gods are like, for whatever their character is discovered to be, the man who is going to please and obey them must endeavour as best he can to resemble them. If the deity is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also must be free; if beneficent, he also must be beneficent; if high-minded, he also must be high-minded, and so forth; therefore, in everything he says and does, he must act as an imitator (zēlōtēs) of God.120 ([Location 6914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6914))

- Here, for Epictetus, is the heart both of ‘physics’ and of ‘ethics’, and all to be argued out strenuously according to his own practice of ‘logic’. Once one has this knowledge, one is ready for the philosopher’s specific active vocation: to be dispatched like a scout or a spy in a time of war, to search out what is really going on, and then to come back and explain to people that they are mistaken in their perceptions of good and evil, and to point out the truth of the situation whether people want to hear it or not.121 Philosophers, to return to our opening image, are to be like owls who see in the dark – and then like heralds who announce the message with which they have been entrusted. Paul had a different message, but might well have agreed with the outline of the vocation as Epictetus articulated it.122 ([Location 6922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6922))
- Marcus Aurelius follows the usual topics of logic, physics and ethics: in order to act rightly (ethics), one must think clearly, not trusting false impressions (logic), but must understand one’s place within ‘the All’ (physics). This will lead to accepting what is inevitable, and behaving towards others with understanding and integrity. The world, after all, is in a constant state of flux (Marcus, like some earlier Stoics, was an admirer of Heraclitus); hence the need to beware of false impressions, including irrational emotions, and to seek the inner logos in both the world and oneself, guarding one’s soul against wrong judgments. Death, after all, is coming soon (the ‘Meditations’ were written in the emperor’s declining years). There are signs that his view of death leant towards Epicureanism, with the soul itself seen as a mere dream and mist.125 ([Location 6936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6936))
- Here we have the glory and the puzzle of ancient Stoicism – and, in a measure, of the best of ancient philosophy. A noble, temperate, sober vision, careful to avoid wrongdoing or injustice; by all accounts Marcus Aurelius was scrupulous in his public as well as his private life.127 But there could hardly be a clearer statement of the problem: ‘nothing can be evil according to Nature’, so that everything in the world which appears evil cannot be so in fact. One must rise above it, ‘Lord of all pleasures and pains’, accepting the flux and dissolution of the world, and of oneself, ‘with a good grace’ (hileō tē gnōmē). The Universe (kosmos), Nature itself (physis), ‘Universal Nature’ (koinē physis) and ‘the Nature of the Universe’ (hē tōn holōn physis) are all the same thing, and this being is ‘the most venerable of Deities’.128 This single being is the source, the means and the goal of all things: All that is in tune with thee, O Universe, is in tune with me! … All things come from thee, subsist in thee, go back to thee (ek sou panta, en soi panta, eis se panta).129 This could not be further from Epicureanism. Instead of distant, detached divinities, ‘the divine’ is in us and around us, guiding and steering everything all the time. This is indeed the very heart of pantheism: Cease not to think of the Universe (kosmos) as one living Being (hen zōon), possessed of a single Substance (mian ousian) and a single Soul (psychēn mian); and how all things trace back to its single sentience (eis aisthēsin mian); and how it does all things by a single impulse (hormē mia); and how all existing things are joint causes of all things that come into existence; and how intertwined in the fabric is the thread and how closely woven the web.130 The apparent echoes of Paul only serve to show up the dramatic gulf that stands between the apostle and the emperor. For Paul, as for Judaism, the world is the good creation of the one God, who is both intimately involved with it and utterly different from it. That, in turn, begets a quite different approach to life, to death, and to the sense of what it means to be human. To this we shall return.

- From Stoicism proper it is a short step to that disparate phenomenon – more of a mood than a movement – that was called Cynicism. The Cynics (again, our English meanings let us down here, though there is some overlap) prided themselves on pouring scorn on all human pretension. They barked and yapped, like dogs, at the rich, the respectable, and any who gave themselves airs.131 I have written about this movement elsewhere, and do not need to repeat that analysis,132 except to say that it is possible (and some scholars have developed this suggestion) to see Paul himself as in some ways like a wandering Cynic. Certainly his emphasis on parrhēsia, ‘freedom of speech’, in 2 Corinthians and elsewhere, coincides strikingly with the same theme in Cynic thought.133 Though our sources for the Cynic movement are much thinner in Paul’s day than in earlier and later centuries, the portrait of the Cynics in Epictetus indicates that the tradition was alive and well in the first century.

- Ironically perhaps, Plato’s own school, which he might have supposed would lead to more and more people acquiring ‘knowledge’ of the ultimate Good, led many instead to puzzlement over knowledge itself, so that by the time Cicero wrote his famous book ‘On the Nature of the Gods’ in the middle of the first century BC, the word ‘Academic’, i.e. ‘belonging to [Plato’s] Academy’, denoted a third live option for the serious thinker of his day. Some might choose to be Stoics, claiming that through the proper exercise of ‘logic’ they could indeed come both to know the truth about the kosmos and to embrace a life lived ‘in accordance with nature’. Others might choose the way of Epicurus, claiming to know, again by logical reasoning, that the world and the gods were two totally different things, the former proceeding under its own steam by the chance movement of its atomic particles and the latter blissfully detached from the whole messy business. But some – and when Cicero wrote the book he numbered himself among them – were ‘Academics’, insisting that the evidence was insufficient, that ‘knowledge’ about all this was simply unavailable … but that one should still continue to worship the gods as usual, just in case. ([Location 6991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=6991))
- knowledge, including of the divine.138 Cicero has rightly been credited with translating the by then somewhat dusty debates of Greek philosophy into Latin and so giving them a new lease of life. His fresh Latin terminology would serve the subject well for the following millennium and more. But, like most of us, he was not completely consistent.139 In many areas of his writing, not least his ethical and political thought, he leans decidedly in the direction of Stoicism, with its insistence on the immortality of the soul (and the ‘divinity’ of human reason), and the divine care for and guidance of the whole world.140 ([Location 7004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7004))
- Second, Cicero’s mixture of the ‘Academic’ position with several significant elements of Stoicism is a reminder that, granted there was no creedal or dogmatic structure or policing of the different schools and opinions, the influence of Plato himself remained massive throughout the period. Much of his thought – for instance, on the immortality of the soul – had passed into Stoicism, just as much of the Socratic method which he made famous had opened the door for the questioning which led some to Scepticism. The explicit revival of the study of both Plato and Aristotle, which we noted earlier, combined with the teachings of both Stoic and Academic thinkers (the Epicureans alone maintaining, as they would, a dignified detachment), to form a general climate of opinion, at least as to the spectrum of possibilities. In particular, when we ask what Paul might have supposed his hearers would be thinking when he spoke or wrote about a being he referred to as theos, about a powerful pneuma through which this ‘god’ might perform new deeds in his people, about the creation and recreation of the cosmos, and many other things besides, we must assume, and we must assume that he assumed, that the default mode for their thinking would be somewhere in the region of the Stoic development of Plato’s thought.

- Philosophy, in the ancient world, was ‘everyday life’, lived, reflected upon and interpreted in this or that way. Each of the traditions inculcated a way of life, and what each meant by ‘reason’ or ‘wisdom’ was a meaning which nested within that totality. For some, therefore, embracing a philosophy came to involve a significant break with their previous life; everything was now different. This sense of a totality is part of what I have tried to indicate with the worldview-model which I and others have developed, recognizing that the word ‘worldview’ itself can, for some, point to a rather modern sense of ‘detached ideas’, but redefining it so as to bring into full and appropriately complex integration the life and tradition within which the ideas and theories mean what they mean and make the sense they make.

- Behind all the divergence of the schools, the bright-eyed challenge remained: to see in the dark, to discern how the world really was, as opposed to how most people, misled by false impressions or the cunning of deceitful rhetoric, imagined it to be. Only then might one discern how to live, to live in accordance with physis, with the way things really were. And for that task one needed logic, one needed to think clearly, to reason properly from one point to the next. Beyond that, the praxis diverged along with the teaching. Epicureans, believing that the world was divided radically into two, with the gods enjoying their detached bliss and the physical world developing in its own way, strongly recommended a similar detachment for its adherents: hence the Garden, both as a location for their school and as a hope to be realized in a country retreat for those who could afford it. The Stoics, by contrast, never seem to have abandoned the belief that the divinity that was active within all things, themselves included, was intent upon the proper and wise governance of all things. They therefore regularly sought influence in the highest circles: Seneca with Nero, Musonius with Titus, Dio and Pliny with Trajan, Epictetus with Hadrian, and finally Marcus Aurelius giving himself advice on how best to use the supreme position to which Fate had led him. Of course, by the same token, the Stoic praxis of seeking to bring wisdom into the political sphere had a severe corollary. When emperors and others disliked what they heard, banishment or worse might follow, and often did.143 Here too we are reminded of Paul.

- The stories which the philosophers told, explicitly or implicitly, are most revealing. The new-style Platonists still harked back to the great myth of creation in the Timaeus, generally regarded at the time as the most important of Plato’s works. Stories about the creation of the world, and the role of god or the gods in that task, loomed large. The Epicureans, of course, told a complex but coherent narrative about how the material world had come into existence; Lucretius’s version is the clearest, but we must assume that this was a regular theme of all teachers in the school.145 The Stoics naturally taught the opposite narrative: all that exists is the result of the creative logos or pneuma, the active principle, working on the passive principle – fire and air working on earth and water – to produce the richly varied world we know. The end of the story varies similarly, with the Epicurean world dissolving into its component atoms and the Stoic one being eventually consumed by the fire which is its own primary element, only to be reborn and to repeat the process again and again.

- Within Stoic and Cynic ethics, this individual narrative, aimed as with Aristotle at ultimate happiness, contained the regular note of progress.147 One did not acquire fully fledged virtue all at one go; it took practice. This was the basis of all theories of virtue, one of the great lasting contributions of ancient philosophy, however much subsequent traditions have produced modifications.

- Take them first as addressed to more or less the entire ancient philosophical world. Who are we? We are humans, part of the world but trying to understand it and live wisely within it. Where are we? In the world of space, time and matter, but a world which some think teems with divine life as well. What’s wrong? Most people, even most philosophers, do not see clearly enough in the darkness of the world, do not penetrate its secrets, and so do not live in the best possible way. In particular, they lack ‘happiness’ (eudaimonia), both in the normal sense that their circumstances trouble them and in the philosophical sense that, in seeking for normal happiness in outward circumstances, they are ignoring the real happiness that philosophy can help to produce. What’s the solution? Why, study philosophy, of course, and then you will (gradually) accustom your eyes to the darkness of the world so that you can grasp the truth and live in accordance with it. Part of the result will be that you come at least to resemble the divine, and possibly to be transformed into a divine being yourself.148 Ironically, whereas ‘religion’ in the ancient world meant submitting to someone (a god) other than oneself, philosophy meant that one was autonomous; either because, with the Epicureans, the gods are not concerned with what we do, so that we are only responsible to ourselves, or because, with the Stoics, the divinity is within us, so that responsibility to god and responsibility to self seem to be the same thing viewed from two different angles. Death itself will either be a return to absolute nothingness (Epicurus) or a transformation into a better life (Plato); as we have seen, some highly regarded Stoics kept this question open. What time is it? That’s the sort of question, our philosophers might say, that a Jew might ask … (The Stoics might have said that it was time for moral effort; the Academics, that it was time for more thought; the Peripatetics, that it was time for more research; the Epicureans, that it was time for a drink …) ([Location 7081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7081))

- A Stoic would, of course, give sharper answers to the questions. Who are we? We are creatures composed, as is the whole world, of a mixture of the elements, with the physical element of fire indwelling us in the form of the human psychē. We are therefore part of the divine, and the divine is part of us. Where are we? Within the Universe, the Cosmos, Nature, to pan – which is itself composed of the four elements, with fire and air acting upon earth and water to produce manifold forms of life. The same logos is at work in the world as within each of us. What’s wrong? Nothing is wrong with the world itself (the Epicureans would have disagreed strongly at this point). However, most people, deceived either by false impressions or by sloppy thinking or both, do not realize the truth of the matter, and so spend their time in futile pursuit of a mirage they think of as happiness. Even philosophers find it difficult to get it right all the time. What’s the solution? No surprises: study philosophy, start off on the path that might make you a sage, and continue to discipline yourself, to examine your own life and to take yourself in hand. All the virtues are within your grasp through the divine life within you, so co-operate with it and nerve yourself for the moral struggle. This will result in the appropriation (oikeiōsis) of what is in fact natural to ourselves. The end result (surprisingly similar, this, right across the philosophical board): a calm, untroubled life, free, self-sufficient, self-controlled. (The Stoics aimed to achieve this by refusing to regard pleasure and pain as important; the Epicureans, by regarding them as… ([Location 7095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7095))

- in a book such as the present we have the chance to stand back and look at the larger picture. When we do, it is hard to suppose that Paul himself would not have had great respect for some of those we have studied. It is too easy to assume that, as a zealous Pharisaic Jew, he would simply sweep them all away as so much skybala, trash. Certainly that is not what he seems to be saying in some of the key passages: These are the things you should think through: whatever is true, whatever is holy, whatever is upright, whatever is pure, whatever is attractive, whatever has a good reputation; anything virtuous, anything praiseworthy.149 ([Location 7114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7114))

- Whatever. Paul believed that he had been given insight into all things, all wisdom, through the divine pneuma, the spirit of the Messiah.150 This kind of wisdom already made the ‘wisdom of the world’ look like foolishness to him.151 But precisely because this spirit was the spirit of the one God who had made the whole world – already we glimpse large areas of disagreement to be explored in due course – Paul expected that there might be points of overlap, of congruence. He would indeed regard it as his right and calling to ‘take every thought prisoner and make it obey the Messiah’, but there were plenty of thoughts out there which, he might have judged, would be ready servants if only they were set within the right household. Not only thoughts; methods. How this plays out we must explore later on. ([Location 7120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7120))

- The schools, as I have stressed, each shared a common life. Since the idea of a common life was itself an important element in the various philosophies (with the Stoics particularly emphasizing koinōnia), we should assume that such communities formed more or less coherent units, meeting to study the works of the founders and to encourage one another in living the appropriate life. As I hinted before, it would be saying too much to suggest that the churches which Paul founded were just like these philosophical schools.158 But it would be saying too little to suggest that they had nothing in common. If Luke’s description of those who met Paul in Athens is anything to go by, it would have been natural for members of such schools to try to put Paul into one or other of their regular pigeon-holes.159 And even though, in that case, they concluded that he was a rag-bag teacher (spermologos, one who picks up words and gossip like a bird picking up seeds) preaching ‘foreign divinities’ (xena daimonia), anyone who looked at the communities Paul had founded might have responded that in fact he was more like the philosophers themselves. If the philosophers thought Paul was offering some odd kind of religion, I suspect that the religious would have thought he was offering some kind of philosophy.

- Nobody knows exactly when Wisdom was written, or by whom, but the book must be roughly contemporary with Jesus and Paul or perhaps slightly earlier.160 One of the most striking features of the book, in general but also in terms of our present discussion, is that it draws on Platonic and Stoic ideas in order to present the figure of ‘Wisdom’ as occupying the place in the divinely created and ordered cosmos which in the Stoics was taken by the logos or the pneuma: ([Location 7173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7173))
- In the light of our previous exploration of Stoic themes, there should be no difficulty in proposing that a first-century reader would understand the author to be claiming for ‘Wisdom’ personified what the philosophers had said of the pneuma, and to be developing this in familiar ways (making people ‘friends of God’ and so on). There appears to be, here, more of an attempt than is made in the ancient Hebrew scriptures themselves to give an account of the inner, perhaps even ‘metaphysical’, workings of the cosmos, including the typically Stoic notion that the deity created the world out of shapeless hylē, ‘matter’, the passive principle.162 And, exactly as in Stoicism, ‘ethics’ follows naturally: what humans need is precisely this ‘wisdom’, in order to know the secrets of how the world works (7.15–22a) and so to develop the consequent life of virtue (8.7, listing the four classical virtues of temperance, prudence, justice and courage).

- Another development which takes this book a lot further than anything in the earlier scriptural writings is Wisdom’s clear teaching of a ‘soul’ which is both ‘pre-existent’ (8.19–20), ‘weighed down’ by the present perishable body (phtharton sōma, 9.15), and able to survive physical death.163 The righteous, like righteousness itself, are ‘immortal’.164 ([Location 7197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7197))

- This is more or less exactly what Epicurus and his followers believed and taught. The corollary, though, might have startled them: ‘the wicked’ then proceed, on this basis, to persecute ‘the righteous’, because such a person is inconvenient, reproaching sin and claiming to know a better way. I do not know that Stoics ever accused Epicureans of this kind of plot or persecution, though it has its own logic: if pleasure is the goal, and if the self-appointed ‘righteous’ are making life miserable by their criticisms, pleasure might be enhanced if they were out of the way. In any case, it is against that background that Wisdom then affirms that ‘the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God.’ They may have been persecuted and killed, but God is looking after them.

- So far, so Stoic. Indeed, to this extent Wisdom might be hailed as one of the more eloquent expositions of a Stoic position. But the book is far more subtle, and intricately woven, than simply a Jewish attempt to expound a pagan philosophy. At every point in the book these apparently Stoic themes, subjects and technical terms are used to undergird an essentially Jewish claim. The book functions as a large-scale exposition of the second psalm: the nations are in uproar, but the one true God establishes his king, and calls the nations to tremble before him. It is Solomon, David’s son, who extols wisdom in chapters 7, 8 and 9, and prays that he may be given the wisdom he needs to govern God’s people. ‘I perceived,’ he says, ‘that I would not possess wisdom unless God gave her to me’ (8.21); in other words, unlike the logos or pneuma in Stoicism, ‘wisdom’ is not automatically part of the make-up of all humans. Nor is immortality an automatic human possession; it will be the result of a righteous life, while the wicked, who have articulated the Epicurean doctrine, will find that doctrine to be true in their own case.166 In any case, the ‘immortality’ promised to the righteous is not merely that of a disembodied life ‘in the hand of God’. ([Location 7216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7216))
- The promise in 3.1–3 is only the first phase of a larger narrative, in which In the time of their visitation they will shine forth and will run like sparks through the stubble. They will govern nations and rule over people, and YHWH will reign over them for ever.167 As I and others have demonstrated elsewhere, this is Wisdom’s prediction of a two-stage post-mortem reality for the righteous: first a time of resting ‘in the hand of God’, and then a time of return, restoration, and sharing God’s sovereign rule. It is, in fact, a coded (but quite clear) prediction of resurrection.168 Such a notion would of course have been anathema not only to Epicureans, but also to Stoics, Platonists and more or less everyone else across the spectrum of paganism. At this point, the Wisdom of Solomon has taken the language of philosophy and has made it serve, decisively, an essentially Jewish vision of reality.

- The whole second half of the book of Wisdom is a retelling of the ancient story of Israel, arguing that Wisdom’s activity in the world is focused, not on the general task of making humans virtuous, but on the life and story of Israel. The critique of pagan idolatry in chapters 13 and 14 has its roots in the Psalms and Isaiah 40—55, but it also has its counterparts in the philosophical critique of popular ‘religion’, from Plato and the Pyrrhonians onwards. But the critique itself is framed within a retold exodus narrative in which it becomes clear that the real thrust of the book is not merely philosophical, not merely an attempt to teach this special kind of ‘wisdom’, not merely a critique of one kind of ‘religion’ in favour of another, but political. ‘Egypt’ in the story stands not only, we may assume, for the pagan Egypt of the writer’s own day, always capable of launching another pogrom against its Jewish inhabitants, but for any great power which oppresses and enslaves God’s people.

- The more we understand how Stoic thought worked, the more the Wisdom of Solomon stands out not just as a Jewish version of that same philosophy but as a striking attempt to express the still very Jewish belief in the one creator God, and in his as yet unfinished purposes for Israel, in the thought-forms of the day, not by capitulation (remember the sharp critique both of idolatry and of Epicureanism) but by transformation.

- The Latin word religio, Judge points out, meant ‘scruple’, and one might have scruples about many things, not only one’s duties to the gods.18 The New Testament has no exact word for ‘religion’, but uses terms like eusebeia, ‘piety’ or ‘godliness’; thrēskeia, ‘worship’, or the practices associated with it; or latreia, the ‘service’ that one might offer to the gods as to one’s social superiors.19 The word ‘religion’ only gradually came to be used, in the ancient world, in relation to Christianity, and the idea that there might then be different ‘religions’ was an innovation of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. As Judge points out, this new idea of a plurality of ‘religions’ was then exported from the modern west to other parts of the world, causing surprise, for instance, among the sages of India who discovered, thanks to the colonizing British, that they had a ‘religion’ called ‘Hinduism’.20 Among the many twists and turns of academic talk about ‘religion’, the present mood has ironically institutionalized what sees itself as a non-totalizing culture (‘the right to choose how to live’) which, says Judge, ‘may be deeply repugnant to other “religions”.’21 ([Location 7662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7662))

- All of this could be summed up, for Cicero, as cultus deorum, the ‘cult’ of the gods.32 The word ‘cult’ starts another hare running. Even though most readers will assume that this does not, in Cicero’s world, carry the modern sense of ‘strange and perhaps dangerous religious sect’, they may assume that it either means ‘worship’ in some recognizably modern sense, or ‘ritual’, again in a modern sense, whereas for Cicero and his contemporaries it meant both of these but also much more besides. The Latin dictionary offers the basic meanings of cultus as ‘labouring at’, ‘labour’, ‘care’, ‘cultivation’ and (rarely) ‘culture’, with the derived meanings of ‘training, education’, and then, in particular, ‘an honouring, reverence, adoration, veneration’ (clearly the main emphasis for Cicero in the present passages); but it can also mean ‘care directed to the refinement of life’, or ‘style, manner of life, culture, cultivation, elegance, polish, civilisation, refinement’ with further meanings fanning out from there.33 It is thus no accident that the word cultus points directly forward to our modern word ‘culture’ (though of course here as elsewhere we should assume significant slippage).34 ([Location 7741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7741))

This was how people, the people to whom Paul addressed his message, thought and felt. ([Location 7821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7821))

- The way in which Rome came to dominate the Mediterranean world, from Spain and north Africa in the west to the long eastern circle from Greece round to Egypt, is itself a highly complex story, not least when we consider its ‘religious’ and/or ‘cultural’ dimensions. Though the Romans applied the same method in every place (send in the legions, crush opposition, establish local elites as intermediary rulers, crucify rebels, levy taxes, proclaim ‘peace and security’), they were pragmatists, and were for the most part prepared to work out local solutions, again not least in relation to ‘religious’ or ‘cultural’ life. We shall come to the so-called ‘imperial cult’ in the next chapter. For the moment we need to look more broadly at the ‘religious’ and/or ‘cultural’ world of Greece, Asia Minor and the Levant as it had been before Rome arrived, and then at the rich and complex mixture that characterized the cities where Paul spent most of his public career. Rome added to, but did not normally displace, what had been there before. ([Location 7826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7826))
- Historically speaking, Greek culture can be traced back to the much earlier Minoan and Mycenean civilizations, and though the lines of derivation are blurred it is highly likely that some key features of what we now think of as classical Greek culture and religion (particularly that of the fifth and fourth centuries BC) can be traced back that far. Geographically, the Greeks saw themselves as a single, though differentiated, culture on either side of the Aegean Sea. Today’s Greek mainland and the Aegean islands formed an important part of this wider ‘Greece’, but the Asia Minor seaboard, from the Black Sea in the north right down to the coastal area of the south-west, was also ethnically, culturally and religiously Greek. All of Paul’s life and work, including his arrival in Rome, took place within a world rooted in and still shaped by Greek culture.

- This historical derivation and geographical distribution makes an important point for all subsequent study of ‘Greek’ religion and culture: it was irreducibly pluriform. Even when Athens acquired an empire at the height of its power in the fifth century BC, the islands and coastlands that came under its rule were diffuse. Their culture and religion could not have been standardized even if anyone had wanted to try. Greece, even (mostly) under Athenian rule, remained a collection of at least semi-autonomous cities and islands. Whereas Rome, a single city, was able to think in terms of tightly drawn cultural and religious lines, Greece had never done so.50 ([Location 7863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7863))

- The main lines of ‘Greek religion’, though, were already clear, owing their classic form to Homer and to a lesser extent Hesiod.51 The gods were presumed to live on Mount Olympus, roughly a hundred and fifty miles north of Athens, and everyone knew who they were: the ‘senior twelve’ of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hermes, Demeter, Dionysos, Hephaistos and Ares, with attendant lesser gods and, out beyond them, nature deities such as tree-spirits or river-nymphs, and, not least, an uncountable host of daimones.52 Of particular note among the other divinities were Hestia, the hearth-goddess (the hearth was the centre or focus of each home, and each home was itself a place of religious worship); Prometheus, the great opponent of Zeus; the goat-god Pan, who later becomes associated with monotheistic speculation because his name, pan, means ‘all’; the earth-goddess Gaia; the underworld-god, Hades; and, inevitably, Helios the sun-god and Selene the moon-goddess. Heracles (the Greek equivalent of the Latin Hercules) and Asclepius (Latin Aesculapius) are in a slightly different category, having human mothers but divine fathers (Zeus and Apollo respectively). They occupied a kind of middle… ([Location 7868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7868))

- The important point of a temple was that it was a dwelling for the god or goddess, in the quite literal sense that the cult image was housed and venerated there. This image (an ‘idol’, though without the strong negative overtones of that word in Israel’s scriptures and Jewish and Christian tradition) would usually be a carved statue of some sort, of stone or wood, though occasionally a lump of unhewn rock, perhaps a meteorite, would be regarded as a heaven-sent cult object.54 Sacrifices would be offered in the temple, and the meat then distributed to worshippers or sold in the market. Greek cities did not have a priestly caste (though some families carried on a tradition); as long as the proper rites were followed and words spoken, anyone, even women and slaves, could offer sacrifice. Local officials, often civic leaders, would preside at major religious events, while things were kept in good order by a caretaker (neokoros) and other functionaries. In most cases even these were part-time positions. ([Location 7895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7895))

- Apart from individual sacrifices and prayers, a good deal of the ‘religious’ activity in an ancient Greek city centred upon the major festivals: ‘as the sanctuary articulates space, so the festival articulates time.’55 A sacred calendar was kept, and designated festivals gave opportunity for celebration and spectacle which set such moments dramatically aside from everyday concerns. Processions were the regular feature, winding their way through the city to whichever shrine was the centre for that particular occasion. Special clothes would be worn, and sometimes particular objects (tree branches, for instance, and in some cases the ‘idol’ itself) might be carried. Dancing and music would be the order of the day; for the music, there would be singers, and local poets would frequently compose new lyrics for special occasions.

- Though in many ceremonies one may detect echoes of fertility cults, acted out in overtly sexual displays such as those involving giant erect phalluses, by the classical period this had mostly turned into a release of social rather than sexual tension: ‘the antagonism between the sexes is played up and finds release in lampoonery.’56 Festivals were also an occasion for contests: beauty contests, music contests, sporting contests (the Olympic Games being merely the most famous of many), and dramatic contests such as those in which the great fifth-century tragic poets Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides regularly competed. And above all, of course, the festival procession would end with a banquet, a great feast for everyone in which the gods themselves were understood to be sharing.57 ([Location 7911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7911))

- How did the gods respond to this treatment? By giving signs, portents, omens of one sort or another, most of which took specialized skill to interpret. In close connection with temple, sacrifice and festival, the behaviour of the sacrificial animal (how easily it died, and so forth) might reveal a lot about whether the divinity was receiving the offering favourably. Once the animal was dead, its innards would be inspected, with the condition of the liver being particularly important; this practice of haruspication was widespread across the ancient world. Generals took specialist seers with them into the field to offer sacrifice, inspect the entrails and thereby discern whether the moment was right for battle. One might enquire of such a seer (mantis) whether a particular business trip would be opportune, or concerning the right day (or the right partner) for a marriage.

- But inspecting the entrails of a sacrificial animal was just the beginning. The gods could communicate good or bad news through all kinds of natural phenomena, from thunder and lightning to the flight of birds, particularly birds of prey. An eclipse would be of particular significance. Dreams, in particular, could and often (though not always) did reveal either the favour or guidance of a god, and they might also on occasion foretell the future.58 If the world was full of gods, it was only to be expected that they would send out signals of their presence and of the many otherwise hidden meanings behind the surface of ordinary ([Location 7927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7927))

- The most dramatic means of divine disclosure came through oracles, of which the oracle at Delphi was easily the most famous. Set in glorious and evocative natural surroundings at the reputed centre of the world,60 the shrine of Apollo was thought to embody the victory of that god over the dark forces in the world, and hence to be the place where he might give advice to individuals or cities as to how that victory might be accomplished in their case. The supplicant would offer a sacrifice and then, if the auspices were favourable, the question would be put, via ‘holy men’ and one or more ‘prophets’, to the Pythia, the local woman who, set apart for life, served as, and was venerated as, the mouthpiece of the god. She, having inhaled the smoke from the sacred fire in the cave, would make her pronouncement, which would be conveyed by the prophets to the worshipper. Delphic oracles became proverbial for their ambiguity, and answers might only gradually reveal their meaning. When Croesus, the last king of Lydia (c.560–546 BC), was contemplating war, the Delphic oracle told him that if he attacked the Persians he would destroy a mighty empire. Croesus was overjoyed; only in retrospect did it become clear that the mighty empire in question would be his own.61 Socrates’s friend Chaerephon once asked the Delphic oracle if anyone was wiser than Socrates, and the oracle replied that nobody was. When on trial for his life, Socrates explained to the court that he had tested this out over time, by… ([Location 7933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7933))

- The phenomenon of oracles points to two further and final features of particular interest from the world of Greek religion. First, the trance-like state of the Pythia is one example of a much more widespread phenomenon, that of ecstasy or frenzy, either individual or in a group.64 Plato distinguishes four types of ‘divine madness’: that associated with Apollo, through which the god inspires prophecy; that associated with Dionysos, the ‘mystic madness’ which, through alcohol, initiates the worshipper into a different state of consciousness; the poetic ‘madness’ inspired by the Muses; and the madness of love, driven by Aphrodite or Eros.65 This points to what we know as… ([Location 7948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7948))

- In the world of ancient paganism such books never played anything like the role of Israel’s scriptures in Judaism and Christianity. Indeed, the absence of ‘sacred texts’ in the latter sense within ancient paganism is one of many fascinating differences between the common life of the ancient world and the message and worldview which Paul the apostle was commending. ([Location 7960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7960))
- The mysteries of Eleusis, a short distance from Athens, were among those that offered ‘the guarantee of a better fate in the afterworld’.69 The shrine was extremely popular; most though not all Athenians had been initiated, and the practice was open to all, including women, slaves and foreigners. Not everyone approved. Aristophanes made fun of such practices, and we may assume that some at least in his audience would have sympathized.70 But mockery would only be allowed to go so far. It was a drunken parody of the Eleusinian mysteries that got Socrates’s friend Alcibiades into trouble, and led at least indirectly to Socrates’s own trial and death.71 The mysteries continued to be popular well into the Roman period; Cicero himself admits to being an initiate.72 ([Location 7971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7971))
- He might not so readily have admitted to having taken part in the festivals of Dionysos. Primarily the god of wine and drunkenness, Dionysos was known in the Greek cult (and then in Rome) as ‘Bacchus’, so that his initiates became ‘the ‘Bacchoi’. His festivals involved serious frenzy, orgiastic behaviour, and a sense of transformative union with the divine; they were popular throughout Greece, and in Athens alone there were seven such festivals each year. To quote Albert Henrichs in the Oxford Classical Dictionary, Festivals of Dionysus were often characterized by ritual licence and revelry, including reversal of social roles, cross-dressing by boys and men, drunken comasts in the streets, as well as widespread boisterousness and obscenity. In Athens as throughout Ionian territory, monumental phalli stood on public display, and phallophoric processions paraded through the streets … The god’s dark side emerged in rituals and aetiological myths concerned with murder and bloodshed, madness and violence, flight and persecution, and gender hostility.73 One can imagine the reaction of urbane Cicero ([Location 7978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7978))

- A different system again was taught by Pythagoras, who (in contrast to the mythical Orpheus) was a real-life sixth-century individual, originally from the Greek island of Samos but living most of his life in southern Italy. He was a mathematician and scientist who taught an ascetic lifestyle and the prospect of the soul’s transformation in the present and transmigration in the future. Precise details of both Orpheism and Pythagoreanism are hard to come by. But the phenomenon they both represent is full of interest for the student of early Christianity. They can be seen, argues Burkert, ‘as a protest movement against the established polis’: Instead of the pre-existing communities of family, city, and tribe there was now a self-chosen form of association, a community based on a common decision and a common disposition of mind.74 ([Location 7991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=7991))
- But with the opening up of the near east after Alexander’s conquests, and the resultant sense that the whole known world was now a kind of extended polis (hence the word ‘cosmopolitan’), the ancient Greek mysteries were joined, right across the regions under Roman rule or influence, by a much wider range of private religious options. When people in Paul’s world thought of ways in which life might be radically transformed, they might well think of the cults of the Great Mother (Magna Mater) and her consort Attis, native to Phrygia in central western Asia Minor, or of Isis and Osiris from Egypt.75 Many other such cults flourished elsewhere in the region, as devotees of this or that divinity established their own religious micro-worlds here and there.76 As with many such phenomena in the ancient Mediterranean world, it is often an open question whether the different names are simply different local variations on the same theme, or whether they represent initially independent cults; but for our purposes this does not matter. The point is that Attis, or Osiris, is the male god who symbolizes in his own death the end of the old year, awaiting rebirth the following spring. A fertility god, in fact. His rebirth was guaranteed by the power and providence of the Great Mother, sometimes at least partially identified with Isis. Their cults offered an initiation through which one might oneself experience that death and rebirth, through a variety of rituals, dramas and accompanying narratives, and the unveiling of secret pictures and objects which might be images of the god(dess) or some symbol of the fertility one was anticipating.77 ([Location 8003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8003))

- In particular, we find in this cult the famous ritual of the taurobolium, in which the person to be initiated or consecrated was placed in a pit under a wooden floor in which several holes had been bored, whereupon a bull would be sacrificed in the upper chamber and the person below drenched with its blood.78 As in other religious expressions, the ritual would include some kind of food or drink, believed to be shared with the divinity. The aim of all such practices was not, as Aristotle pointed out, to learn things, but to experience things and so to come to a new state of mind.79 ([Location 8016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8016))

- By the time Paul arrived in Rome in the late 50s of the first century, there was already a regular festival in honour of the Magna Mater and Attis, held in March every year. The Phrygian goddess had been admitted to the Roman pantheon as early as 204 BC; ([Location 8022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8022))
- Already by this time there was another new mystery religion, spreading rapidly not least because of its popularity in the Roman army. Mithras seems to have begun further east again, in Persia or even India.81 Plutarch says that the cult was in evidence among the pirates in south-eastern Asia Minor during the first century BC,82 and there is evidence that the first Mithraic initiates were from – guess where? Tarsus, a city already noted in another connection.83 What an interesting town the young Saul grew up in. By the second century AD the cult was in full swing right across the Roman world. Mithraism was emphatically a male religion: only men were allowed to join, and Mithras himself was portrayed as a sun-god, a bull-killer, a heavenly soldier fighting for light, truth and justice. His initiates were ranked, as one might expect in a cult with military roots, in several stages of hierarchy, ascent through these orders being attained through harsh tests and initiation ceremonies. Initiates met in groups for worship, in chambers they called ‘caves’ which they regarded as ‘microcosms’, ‘little universes’, covered in zodiacal decoration and always featuring an elaborate picture of Mithras killing a bull and rescuing the world (or at least the worshippers) by means of its blood.84 They would line up opposite one another on benches, the different ranks clad in different colours, to share a common meal. The aim of it all seems not merely to have been inner spiritual strengthening and the chance of a better life after death. Unlike the gnostics, whose religion encouraged them to ignore and escape the world, and unlike the Epicureans, who arrived at the same escapist result by a very different route, devotees of Mithras were strengthened in their resolve to be brave and resolute in fighting Rome’s battles and defending its empire: The Mithraist, like the Stoic, was at home everywhere in the universe and in society, notably in imperial and cosmopolitan Roman society, where loyalty to the emperor and the consciousness of serving, each in his own position, were in fundamental accord with a religion of ‘Soldiers’ and the oath, sacramentum. In many respects, Mithraism rendered sacred certain constant values of Roman-ness.85 Mithraism continued to flourish right across the Roman world until it was overthrown (and sometimes overbuilt) in the rise, and eventual legitimation, of Christianity. Though it was not, as used sometimes to be claimed, ever likely to prove a major world religion, it was undoubtedly a lively presence in the world from which Saul of Tarsus had come, and into which Paul the Apostle went with the news of one who had overcome a very different enemy by very different means.

- Since Paul only arrived in Rome itself towards the end of his public career, one might be tempted to suppose that the specifics of Roman religion, oriented as it was to the city itself, would be less relevant to his earlier travels. This would be a mistake. Not only did Rome welcome into its own ‘family’ the gods of other cities, particularly those that had been ‘persuaded’ to leave their native cities so that Rome could then defeat the cities in battle.86 That centripetal movement was matched by two centrifugal movements: colonies and armies. Both extended Roman culture and religion right across the entire area of Paul’s life and work. ([Location 8050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8050))
- Colonies and armies were of course related. Many colonies, the ones in northern Greece being a case in point, had been founded because Rome did not relish the thought of veteran soldiers returning to Italy, eager for reward and careless of other people’s lives and property. There were veteran soldiers in plenty in northern Greece after the civil wars of the 40s and 30s BC, and one of the ways of getting them to beat their swords into ploughshares was by the gift of land. By Paul’s day there were thriving colonies in Philippi and Corinth (though Corinth was a civil, not an ex-military, foundation), and a string of others on both sides of the Aegean Sea. Others were placed further inland, in southern Asia Minor, for instance those at Antioch and Lystra, two of… ([Location 8055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8055))
- Troops and their officers might well be stationed in one area for several years, and their way of life would naturally have an impact on the world around them. There is evidence, for instance, of the Roman army living by the official religious calendar even in the far-flung recesses of the eastern empire.89 Roman religion, therefore, though not originally diffuse in the manner of the geographically diverse Greek culture, had spread far and wide by Paul’s day across the same world of the eastern Mediterranean which we have already been describing. And, once again, we must never forget the intimate and tight-woven link between ‘… ([Location 8063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8063))
- By the first century, too, we find subtle religious developments within Rome which signal her emergence from small city-state to world power: By this period Romans were (and knew themselves to be) a world power; the small city-state on the Tiber was already well on the way to being the multicultural cosmopolis … The ancient religious traditions of the city – Rome’s relations with its divine citizens – explained Rome’s rise to power, represented its success and ensured its continuance for the future. The constructive revival of old, half-forgotten rituals played a key role in the extension of Roman horizons. It was an assertion that the religious traditions of early Rome ordered the imperial universe.92 ([Location 8076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8076))
- a different name in Rome. Zeus is Jupiter; Poseidon, Neptune; Hera, Juno; Athene, Minerva; Aphrodite, Venus. Ares becomes Mars; Artemis, Diana; Demeter, Ceres; Hephaistos, Vulcan; and Dionysos, Bacchus. Heracles changes a couple of letters to become Hercules; Asclepius adds a couple to become Aesculapius. Of the major divinities, only Apollo retains his name unchanged in both cultures. This is the most obvious setting of what has been called the interpretatio Romana, the ‘Roman interpretation’ of other people’s divinities, with some thinkers making light of the task and aligning differently named but similarly attributed divinities and others wondering whether they were in fact the same. It mattered; if you addressed a god by the wrong name you might not get the response you wanted. ([Location 8083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8083))
- The ‘Roman interpretation’, though, was intimately connected with another obvious phenomenon: the Roman triumphal expansion. Throughout the last three centuries BC, Rome (still then a republic, and proud of it) consistently enlarged the territory over which it had won sovereignty, starting with the bulk of Italy itself and spreading out in all directions. And with Rome – not least with her soldiers – went the Roman divinities. ‘Rome’s success was the gods’ success.’98 As Hegel already suggested, some kind of syncretism might well be part of the imperial package: the Romans did their best to ‘assemble all gods and spirits in the pantheon of world domination in order to transform them into an abstract and shared entity.’ ([Location 8096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8096))
- Janus, the god of beginnings, had a temple whose doors, kept open in wartime, made a powerful symbolic statement when Augustus, shutting them, declared thereby that he had brought peace to the Roman world. Peace itself, pax, became a goddess, as did several other abstractions, including fides, ‘faith’, ‘faithfulness’ or ‘loyalty’.102 Others joined them: Spes (hope), Victoria and Libertas which hardly need translating, and, of considerable interest for our overall theme, Iustitia, corresponding broadly to the Greek Dikē. The temple for ‘Justice’ was consecrated on 8 January AD 13, just over a year before Augustus’s death.103 This goddess, it was thought, was active in bringing wrongdoers to trial before the high god, and in punishing injustice. Sometimes, in inscriptions, she acquires the highly significant second name, Augusta. Augustus wanted it to be believed, as widely as possible, that he had brought not only peace to the Roman world (through military conquest, of course), but also a type and level of justice never before seen.104 This is one of many important ingredients in the great innovation that came about as the new-minted empire of Augustus gathered religious and theological as well as political pace.

- The private home was equally important, with the hearth and its ‘household gods’ as the focus, and the father of the family acting as priest. These ‘household gods’ comprise the Lares, small statues of two young men, and the Penates, the small cult statues placed at the innermost point of the home, and clearly seen as symbolic of the ultimate identity of a particular family.105 Harder to describe, but extremely important, was the genius of the father of the household.106 The genius was the deified concept of the person in his true identity or self. It could be represented with a small statue, and was invoked on the occasion of marriage, or of oath-taking. Philosophically speaking, the genius was the true, spiritual inner core of a person, or indeed of a place; hence the genius loci, the ‘spirit of a place’, which could also be invoked as a divinity. ([Location 8119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8119))
- The ‘place’ above all which mattered in Roman religion was Rome itself. One feature of life, not only in Rome but in many other cities, which moderns may find surprising is the fixing of a boundary, the pomerium, around a city, constituting it as an official sacred space in accordance with augury.107 ‘The importance of the pomerium as a ritually established boundary,’ says one recent writer, ‘would be impossible to overstate.’108 It marked the distinction not only between ‘Roman’ and ‘foreign’ but between ‘urban’ and ‘rural’, and for that matter ‘civil’ and ‘military’. In the imperial period, massive stone blocks indicated its route; successive emperors claimed the right to extend the pomerium as they had extended the empire itself. Different types of activity, both political and religious (and as we have seen these overlapped anyway) were carried on outside and inside; the rigid separations, however (for instance between military life outside and non-military life inside), were strained to breaking point by the combination of civil and military power in the hands of one man, Augustus. It was after he had reigned for over two decades that, finally, a temple to the war-god Mars was built inside the sacred boundary.

Auspices might be taken to mean that a planned action should or should not… ([Location 8161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8161))
- The third category mentioned by Cicero was the quindecemviri, the ‘fifteen men’ (though by the late republic there were actually sixteen of them). They guarded, and interpreted, the Sibylline books, their services being required not least when strange portents or omens had appeared: what did these things mean, and what religious actions should be taken in response? This important role was expanded to include the regulation and oversight of foreign cults, particularly those imported from Greece or elsewhere in the east. Their role in consulting the ancient books and advising on contemporary practice was well exploited by Augustus when, in the late 20s BC, he enquired about the ‘secular games’ (the word ‘secular’ having nothing to do with today’s meaning of ‘non-religious’, but rather with the saeculum, the ‘age’ of 100 years). Ancient Rome had sporadically kept such a celebration of theatrical games and sacrifices, commemorating the passing of another hundred years.

- It is vital if we are to sense the flavour of life in a Roman environment; and much of Paul’s most important work was carried out in a Roman environment, albeit overlaid on a Greek base and with plenty of other imported material coming in alongside.119 Though we must address such questions properly much later, a moment’s thought will make it clear that Paul, in founding a ‘church’ in Corinth or Philippi or elsewhere, was not setting up a new ‘religion’ in any of the kind of senses we have been exploring. He seems to have had no interest in a sacred calendar, and indeed at one point has harsh words for those who do.120 He never suggests that one should sacrifice animals, whether to eat them or to inspect their entrails.121 He never indicates that one ought to pay attention to thunderstorms, or to the flight of… ([Location 8180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8180))
- By the same token, even the small beginnings of a ‘thick description’ of greco-roman culture such as we have made here indicate that when Paul arrived in a town and began to speak about the one true God, and about this God raising from the dead a man called Jesus who was now to be invoked, worshipped and hailed as kyrios, there was a whole network of assumptions, vested interests, long-cherished traditions, hopes and fears both personal and civic, which would be aroused. When the antagonists in Philippi declare that Paul and Silas are Jews, throwing the city into an uproar by ‘teaching customs which it’s illegal for us Romans to accept or practise’,122 and when the crowd in Thessalonica yell out that Paul and Silas have been ‘turning the world upside down’ by ‘acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus’,123 we can understand, in view of the evidence so far surveyed in this chapter, that these, though carrying an inescapably political dimension, were fundamentally to do with a strong, deep-rooted culture, and within that culture with something we may as well call ‘religion’. ‘Religion’ may not be ultimately the best category for describing or analyzing what Paul was doing, or what he thought he was doing. But it is certainly a… ([Location 8188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8188))
- The main thing to emerge for our purposes from this short survey is that what Cicero and others referred to loosely with the word religio penetrated more or less every area of life. From the home, with its hearth and household gods, right up to great affairs of state, noble works of art and culture, and the most important public buildings and civic ceremonies, ‘religion’ was everywhere, because the gods were everywhere. ([Location 8206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8206))
- Furthermore, this religious world both was and wasn’t ordered and tidy. It was, to the extent that the great festivals mattered, the proper performance of regular religious rituals (particularly sacrifices) mattered, and the appropriate investigation of omens and auguries mattered. To neglect those was to jeopardize the polis itself, and potentially to cast a blight on particular enterprises the polis might be conducting. ‘To refuse sacrifice was to refuse the gods.’126 ‘Impiety’ like that might or might not be associated with the possibility of some kind of divine punishment in a future life, but that was a different matter; the more important charge would be that one was endangering the state by either ignoring or insulting one of the divinities involved in the civic life and in that particular project.127 ([Location 8211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8211))
- The religious world was ‘ordered and tidy’, too, in the sense that both in Athens in Socrates’s day and in Rome in Caesar’s day one of the things most likely to arouse hackles was religious innovation. New, foreign divinities might be brought on board (as with the Magna Mater and many other cults in Rome), but there was a proper process of naturalization, and it was to be expected that any such imports would, as it were, behave themselves and settle down as members of the family, not try to take over from any established practices. We must never forget that for the ancient world the power of tradition, of ways of life long established and handed down, was very strong. Exactly unlike much of today’s western culture, the word ‘old’ implied high praise, while ‘new’ carried both a moral and a social sneer.128 Hence the ambiguity,… ([Location 8218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8218))
- Perhaps the most interesting of the philosophical questions to be raised is one on which we have touched only briefly: granted (as most Romans did grant) that the gods of the Roman pantheon were basically the same as the gods of the Greek pantheon, albeit for the most part under other names, how far might the same principle stretch? Could one straightforwardly assume that all peoples worshipped the same divinities, so that all one had to do, like Caesar in Gaul, was to find out which of the local gods performed which function?129 Were the Magna Mater and Isis one and the same? And – more radical still – were the many ‘… ([Location 8229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8229))
- it is important to stress at that very point that whereas indeed for Christians, starting with Paul, ‘belief’, and in particular belief about who ‘God’ really was, took centre stage, this had never been the case for the Greeks and the Romans.

- Roman religion of itself had nothing to do with the teaching of morals. One would not expect a pagan priest, before or after a sacrifice or augury, to give a lecture on some aspect of personal or civic behaviour. If Cicero, his priestly duties done, went home and worked on a philosophical treatise about behaviour, that was a different matter, and had nothing to do with his activities as an augur. Indeed, in traditional religion and its accompanying mythologies, the behaviour of the gods themselves was hardly exemplary. ([Location 8246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8246))
- One of the best known passages, roughly contemporary with Paul, in which this rejection is graphically expressed is from the Wisdom of Solomon, which we have already noted in connection with Jewish engagement with the philosophical world of the time. The writer picks up the scriptural denunciations of the making and the worship of idols, and applies them to the non-Jewish world of his day: But miserable, with their hopes set on dead things, are those who give the name ‘gods’ to the works of human hands, gold and silver fashioned with skill, and likenesses of animals, or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand … The idol made with hands is accursed, and so is the one who made it – he for having made it, and the perishable thing because it was named a god. For equally hateful to God are the ungodly and their ungodliness; for what was done will be punished together with the one who did it. Therefore there will be a visitation also upon the heathen idols, because, though part of what God created, they became an abomination, snares for human souls and a trap for the feet of the foolish.134 The writer then goes on to denounce the worship of cult statues of monarchs, a point to which we shall return in the next chapter. He continues with a catalogue of the horrors which idolaters perpetrate: infanticide, frenzied revels and orgies, theft and deceit; sexual perversion and other disorders. For, he says, the worship of idols not to be named is the beginning and cause and end of every evil. For their worshippers either rave in exultation, or prophesy lies, or live unrighteously, or readily commit perjury; for because they trust in lifeless idols they swear wicked oaths and expect to suffer no harm …135 Of course, the Jews were mocked, misunderstood, and sometimes maltreated for their stance. They were in some places regarded as traitors. ([Location 8256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8256))
- Successive Romans, in particular, discovered that they could not persuade Jews, even on pain of torture or death, to worship ‘the gods’, and being pragmatists the Romans decided to strike a deal (which Tertullian, at the end of the second century, referred to in terms of Judaism being a ‘permitted religion’137). The Jews would not pray to the gods of Rome, but they would pray (to their one God) for the health and well-being of Rome; that principle had been well established, as one of the ground rules for Jews in exile, as long ago as Jeremiah.138 Under the empire, Jews would not pray to the emperor, as everyone else had to do, but they would pray for the emperor. Why not? According to their creational monotheism, with its remarkable role for humans as the imagebearers of the one God, this one God desired and intended that rulers should rule, and would hold them to account according to the wisdom and justice, or otherwise, with which they had exercised power.

- The centrepiece of this resistance is found in mAb Zar, devoted to a careful analysis of how to avoid contamination with paganism. One section lists the pagan festivals, clearly with Roman rituals in mind: ‘the Calends, the Saturnalia, the commemoration of empire, the anniversaries of kings, and the day of [their] birth and the day of [their] death’ (mAb Zar 1.3). Similarly detailed instructions on avoiding pagan contamination, from within a Christian worldview, are found in Tertullian On Idolatry.

- The Roman empire was the great new Fact of the world which included the Palestine of Jesus’ boyhood and the Cilicia of Saul’s. It proclaimed itself as a bright new world: new roads with new soldiers to march along them, new taxes and new coins to pay them with, new administrations and lawcourts, local officials falling over themselves to erect splendid, prestigious new temples to the divine royal house. New crosses by the roadside, displaying the bird-pecked remains of rebels. Whole cities were redesigned to give honour to the emperor and his family, portrayed, often enough, in the guise of the ancient pagan divinities. Perhaps, after all, the gods had come down in human form. Rome took the eagle as its symbol; popular legend and iconography suggested a direct link to Jupiter, the highest god of all.2 The Romans certainly seemed to be as powerful as gods ought to be.

- By the middle of the first century BC things had become clearer, as the internal power-struggles of the late Roman republic produced generals with reputations to make and glittering prizes to win. Pompey the Great (106–48 BC), having defeated Mithradates VI, king of Pontus in northern Turkey, swept down through the middle east, planting colonies, annexing Syria, and establishing the Roman presence in Judaea in 63 BC. This, famously, was the moment when, over the horrified protests of priests and people alike, he insisted on going in to the Holy of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem, presumably to confront the local god with the news that the upstart goddess Roma was now in charge. Finding no image of the local god, he concluded, logically enough, that the people didn’t have one. They were obviously atheists. ([Location 8600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8600))
- Pompey’s subsequent demise coincided with the ascent to supreme power of his great rival, Julius Caesar, in whose hands the ancient, proud republic found itself transformed into the personal fiefdom of its most successful general. Caesar discovered early on that the Jewish people were different: most subject peoples were content to adopt such Roman customs, including religious practices, as their new overlords imposed, but the Jews for some reason were implacably resistant to such things. Some of Caesar’s later successors, finding this intolerable, tried to impose their will by force. Julius, though, realizing that this was an odd situation but containable, allowed them to practice their own religion in their own way. Some Jews served in his armies, and for this and other reasons he conferred on some of them the grant of Roman citizenship.

- The intervention in the middle east of Pompey and Caesar, and, not long after, of Antony, was not surprising within the wider world of Roman politics. Rome’s far-flung conquests had made her rich, famous and fat: the population in the capital had long outgrown the capacity of the local hinterland to supply enough food, and supplementary grain had to be brought, in considerable quantity, from Egypt. Even at the height of Rome’s imperial success a threat to the grain supply could produce riots on the streets in next to no time. It is striking that,… ([Location 8614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8614))

Hence too the need, which remained paramount for the next two hundred years at least, to keep the strange and awkward nations and races at the eastern end of the Mediterranean as quiet as reasonably possible. Then as now, the west depended on the east for basic resources, and the west was determined to safeguard the supply by political and, where necessary, military force. There were, of course, other serious problems in the middle east, of which the most obvious was the huge potential threat of Parthia (see below).

- All this was going on at a time when native leadership among the Jewish people was itself in decline. The Hasmonean dynasty, founded after the glorious successes (with Roman help6) of the Maccabees a hundred and more years earlier, had gone to seed and become unpopular. Everybody knew, in any case, that they were neither from the royal family of David nor from the priestly house of Aaron, undermining their claim to be both priests and kings. Once the Romans came in, however, everything was in any case going to change. The Romans preferred to rule through local intermediaries. Their preferred method was to find the most obviously powerful local people, confer titles on them, and back them up where necessary. In this case the Hasmoneans were in place, though often criticized by religious and populist pressure-groups, and Pompey reinstated the now elderly Hyrcanus II as high priest. He had held the office already, from 76 to 67, but had then been out of power for four years after his defeat by Aristobulus II in a battle at Jericho. All the rulers of this period were related, within the… ([Location 8625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8625))

- Herod had learned the lesson well.7 When the Parthians swept through the middle east between 40 and 38 (the Parthians occupied, in the Roman imagination, the kind of mythical force of evil which some in the west today still envisage when they think of the countries to the east of Turkey and Syria), it was Herod who recaptured Jerusalem for the Romans. Equally shrewd was his marriage to a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, the granddaughter of Hyrcanus II. Thus, though suspect in many local eyes because of only being half Jewish, Herod was doing his best to legitimate himself as ‘king of the Jews’, a project he was further advancing by his magnificent work on the Temple. A born manipulator – the sort of man for whom the twentieth century would adapt an older Jewish word into ‘schmoozer’ – he knew how to present himself to the pragmatic Romans as the obvious local person through whom to work. Having backed Antony in the Roman civil war, he then boldly switched tracks and offered his services to the victorious Octavian. Octavian, like his adoptive father Julius Caesar, knew a sensible solution when he saw one, and confirmed Herod in office. Thus the confusions of Jewish politics in the first century BC combined with the death-throes of the Roman republic to bring to power a clever warlord for thirty years in Palestine and Judaea and an even cleverer one for forty years in Rome. Octavian, taking the… ([Location 8637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8637))
- This, as I say, was somewhat surprising, granted the long Jewish tradition of critique of empires, from Assyria and Babylon in the middle of the first millennium BC to Persia, Greece, Syria and Egypt more recently. Sometimes a vassal state, sometimes a buffer state, always in the middle of the military routes as well as the trade routes, riven with internal factions, flawed by weak leadership – it is truly remarkable that the Jewish people survived as a recognizable entity, not only in Galilee and Judaea but in a diaspora that stretched from Spain to Babylon, taking in lands both north and south of the Mediterranean. That they did so is testimony to the cultural and social boundary-markers we discussed in chapter 2, and in particular to the power of their own controlling narrative, contained in their extraordinary sacred books. And it was these books that might have given the first-century Jews a sense of how to read the signs of the times. One of the latest books to be added to the collection had tried to do just that. The book of Daniel, whose origins may go back to the sixth century but which seems to have attained its present form around the time of the Maccabean revolt against Syria in the 160s BC, collected the narratives of the various world empires into a sequence of four. They are presented in Daniel 2.31–5 in the form of a dream of the pagan king, who sees a statue with a head of gold, chest and arms of silver, middle and thighs of bronze, and the legs of iron but, in the feet, mixed with clay. This is said to represent four successive kingdoms, of which Babylon, under Nebuchadnezzar, is the first; and the final one will be brought crashing down by the establishment of God’s kingdom in place of these pagan… ([Location 8652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8652))
- A sequence of kingdoms, then, with their varied grandeur and cruelty, but to be terminated by the arrival of God’s kingdom, vindicating the people who had been oppressed by the four preceding ones. One might have thought that the Jews of Herod’s time would have applied all this to their own day, and indeed maybe they did, in oral culture and even in books now lost to us. The first time we meet a serious development of this Jewish view of history, with Rome unambiguously taking the place of the fourth monster, it is a hundred years after Herod’s day and over a generation after the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Here, in the book we now refer to as 4 Ezra, we find Rome at last taking its place, the great and monstrous eagle with its many wings and heads swooping down on the world, to be overthrown in its turn by the lion who, rather obviously, represents Israel’s messianic king. When, as we would expect in an apocalyptic vision, the seer requests an explanation, he is told that the eagle is indeed ‘the fourth kingdom that appeared in a vision to your brother Daniel’, even though it… ([Location 8667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8667))
- In order to understand why Rome did what it did, in the middle of the first century AD, in places as diverse as Antioch and Athens, as Jerusalem and Philippi, we have to have some grasp of the new reality that had come to birth in the capital itself half a century earlier, and the complex web of social, cultural, religious and political forces which had been operative in that revolution and which now sustained the new Roman vision of reality and exported it around its subject territories. This in turn, of course, provides the framework within which, as our larger argument proceeds, we can see how Paul perceived and responded to the new world of the Caesars, and, in particular, the way… ([Location 8679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8679))
- The story of how the great republic was transformed, almost overnight, into an empire with a single emperor, has been told and retold from many of the possible angles. The earliest tellings of that story – those commissioned by or under Augustus himself – are of particular interest for our purposes, since they introduce for the first time in the ancient world, so far as I am aware, the sense of a long historical narrative whose goal and climax, after centuries of quiet preparation, was the sudden emergence of a new sovereign under whose rule peace, justice, freedom and prosperity would spread across the world.

- Ancient Rome had had a succession of kings, the last being Tarquinus Superbus in the late sixth century BC. Legend named Rome’s first king, the founder of the city in 753 BC, as Romulus. Since, however, there is no contemporary evidence for such a figure, and since the name can be explained as a projection from ‘Rome’ rather than vice versa, and since a powerful alternative legend of foundation exists as well (see below), the historian may be content to leave the matter unresolved.17 Anyway, from the time they got rid of Tarquinus the Roman people prided themselves on not having absolute monarchs (such as had been, and continued in many parts to be, the norm in Greece). For half a millennium they organized their increasingly expanding territory as a ‘public matter’, a res publica or ‘republic’, led by two ‘consuls’, elected annually. As the system developed, other magistracies, again open to annual election, were added, but the consuls remained, a living attempt at checks and balances that might thwart any attempt at sole power.

Out of many conflicts and political wranglings one man emerged: Pompey the Great, whom we met a few pages ago in the empty Holy of Holies in Jerusalem. Pompey was the next Roman after Sulla to attain all-powerful status. He both exemplified and solidified the apparent tendency within the now creaky republic to put its trust in a single obviously gifted and successful general over the heads of the long-established system of annually elected officers.

- Pompey’s great power did not go unchallenged. A conspiracy in his absence, led by Catiline, was nipped in the bud by Cicero in his year of consulship (63 BC).20 But even so Pompey’s return, and his proposals for land grants for his veterans, were by no means universally welcomed. He turned for help to two men: Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gaius Julius Caesar. The three formed a pact which, even though the republic was notionally subject to the consuls, gave them enormous power.21 The three managed affairs between them for most of the 50s BC, with Caesar fighting brilliant campaigns in Gaul, Pompey put in charge of Spain (which he ran through subordinates, while himself staying in Rome), and Crassus given responsibility for the east, where he died fighting the Parthians in 53. The republic was still intact; the Senate still ran life in Rome; but the three great men were there, with their friends at court campaigning on their behalf, and everybody knew it.

It was only a few years since Roman had fought Roman, and now it was going to happen again.

- Many political scores were settled, and the consequent confiscations of land raised a good deal of money to pay the massive armies that were now in the field. The Caesar-party then defeated the conspirators Brutus and Cassius at Philippi in 42, continued the civil war in Italy, and defeated Sextus Pompeius, Pompey’s younger son (36). Octavian thereupon stripped Lepidus of his triumviral status, and set about the real war, against Antony. Antony, meanwhile, had taken up with the remarkable Egyptian queen Cleopatra, gaining for himself great power and influence in the eastern provinces which were so vital for Rome’s security and food supply, but also incurring suspicion and unpopularity in Rome itself. Matters came to a head at the battle of Actium in 31. Antony, defeated, fled to Egypt with Cleopatra, and when Octavian’s armies marched into Alexandria a year later the lovers both committed suicide.

- Octavian returned to Rome, the undisputed and indisputable sole ruler. He took the honorific (neither strictly a name nor strictly a title) ‘Augustus’, ‘the exalted one’,23 and the carefully chosen title princeps, which carried at least some overtones of republican precedent and was certainly a way of distinguishing his position from the hated and dangerous idea of ‘dictator’ or even ‘lord’, dominus.24 He celebrated a massive triple triumph to commemorate Actium, Egypt and his earlier victories in the Balkans, and ordered the doors of the Temple of Janus to be shut as a sign that he had brought peace to the whole Roman world. A shattered, exhausted Rome was only too ready to ignore the irony and join in the celebration.25 It would be over a century before a cynic would sneer that Octavian had enticed everyone with the sweet delights of peace. After sixty years, they were ready for it. Ready, too, to make it divine, and to associate it with the man who had brought it: pax Augusta.26 It was this ‘peace’ that allowed the apostle Paul, under Augustus’s successors, to travel the world announcing a different peace, and a different master.

- There had been sole rulers before, as we have seen, though none of them lasted long – a point which will not have been lost on Octavian, still in his thirties and finding himself to be the last man standing in Rome’s half century of blood and fear. He was now imperator, a military title with which soldiers hailed a victorious general and with which, on some occasions, the Senate hailed such a returning victor. It now became clear to all that the title was to belong primarily to Augustus, and he took it as a sort of praenomen: Imperator Caesar Augustus, Emperor Caesar the Exalted. Rome had an empire for a long time; now she had an emperor as well. An occasional title had become an official position. ([Location 8792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8792))
- Augustus used his new position to address some urgent concerns. What was he to do with the thousands upon thousands of military veterans left over from the long years of war? He swiftly did two things: established colonies around the Greek world, and had himself appointed as governor of several key provinces (with ordinary governors on the ground doing the actual work) so that he could master-mind fresh work for the remaining soldiery, directing its energies away from any danger of recurring factionalism and into the task of maintaining peace and security on the vast, far-flung borders. This had an added advantage: no single army consisted of more than four legions. Nobody would be tempted to bring so small a force back across the Rubicon, to use Caesar’s method to challenge Caesar’s successor.

- In terms of his constitutional position Augustus played what in my part of the world we would call a canny game. There was no suggestion of his using the hated term ‘dictator’. He held the consulship – he kept officially refusing it, and the Senate kept insisting – every year until 23 BC, and in that year he acquired the ancient office, and power, of the tribune (tribunicia potestas). This was ironic: tribunes were there to represent ordinary Romans who wanted to complain about the actions of the state, and were given all sorts of powers to help them in this important task (the right to summon popular assemblies, and indeed the Senate, and the right of veto). This power at home, and what used misleadingly to be called Augustus’s imperium maius, ‘greater authority’, over the provinces, were the legal and constitutional basis of his ongoing work.31 He was also asked to become, officially, ‘curator of laws and morals’, with absolute power in these areas, but twice refused – though his own moral legislation (exercised through his tribunician power), attempting to outlaw adultery and to encourage marriage and childbearing which were in danger of falling out of fashion among the rich and noble, shows that he was aware that something needed to be done in this area. Such an office, he explains later, would be quite out of keeping with our ancestral customs.32 His official imperium was granted him by the Senate for ten-year periods in 27 and 8 BC (with two five-year terms in 18 and 13), and also in AD 3 and 13.

- But the long later years of his principate also provided the headache of succession planning, an obvious sign that, however much the older republican forms were still being employed, nobody was expecting to return to a non-imperial system after Augustus’s death. Augustus followed up many possible lines before finally, in AD 6, adopting his stepson Tiberius (son of his wife Livia Drusilla by her first marriage) as his heir, and it was Tiberius who finally succeeded him.

- The fifty years after Augustus’s death saw the empire, in terms of the personal rule of the emperor, both consolidated and threatened. Consolidated, in that after a few years of Tiberius’s rule the old republican ways of checks and balances and properly elected magistrates were all too obviously hollow (they may have been fairly hollow under Augustus, but appearances were better kept up), while real power lay precisely with the emperor and anyone with whom he chose to share it. Threatened, in that Tiberius’s successor, Gaius Caligula, was quickly turned by illness from being an apparently sane man on whom high hopes had been placed to someone quite obviously mentally unfitted for the position. Since there was no arranged succession at the time of his assassination in AD 41, the whole structure which Augustus had so carefully built up could have come crashing down. Several senators, in fact, suggested after Caligula’s… ([Location 8836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8836))
- Anyway, Claudius’s reign (41–54) steadied the ship. He even extended the empire, though whether the acquisition of southern Britain and Mauretania (modern Morocco) were of sufficient benefit to justify the very considerable expense they incurred might be doubted.37 He was not widely popular, it being reckoned that he was too much influenced by his successive wives and one or two very able freedmen, thus sidelining both the old aristocracy and the official civil servants. He was an odd character – if even half of what the scurrilous Suetonius says about him is true, he was a long way off from matching Augustus or even Tiberius in natural leadership quality – and was himself eventually poisoned by his young second wife Agrippina, to nobody’s great regret. She had, of course, a vested interest: one of the two… ([Location 8845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8845))
- Nero was slightly older than the other candidate, Claudius’s own son Britannicus, and he and his mother between them managed, first by pulling the right strings at court and then, a year later, by having Britannicus poisoned, to consolidate him in his position of sole power. He had every advantage, not least in having had the great philosopher Seneca (whom we met in chapter 3) as tutor, and now having him at court as an advisor. A flamboyant character, he was hugely popular in some circles, not least the army, and hugely unpopular in others. Juvenal, looking back with hindsight half a century later, explains that, while one might get away with murdering one’s mother (which Nero did in 59), for a Roman emperor to write and perform plays, to sing on stage, for goodness’ sake, strained Roman… ([Location 8852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8852))
- If the idea of a sole emperor had once seemed like a way of protecting Rome against the horrors of civil war, the next fifteen months gave that notion the lie, as the chance to seize that absolute power led four men in succession to march on Rome and claim the prize.39 Nero was succeeded by the elderly Galba, who early in 69 fell victim to a plot orchestrated from within the court by Otho, whose short reign was terminated by the advancing troops of Vitellius, commander of the legions in Germany. By then, with all restraint gone, the empire was there for anyone with sufficient military support to take it. Some of Otho’s supporters in the Danube region joined forces with Vespasian, the general who had been commanding the legions besieging Jerusalem, and whose troops, hearing of the debacle in Rome, had hailed him as emperor then and there. It may only be the wisdom of hindsight, but all we know of Vespasian suggests that he was an altogether more capable man than any of the emperors since Tiberius. He advanced on Rome, overthrew the short-lived regime of Vitellius, and established himself and his family as the new ruling dynasty.

- This, of course, is where this story joins up most obviously with the story, both explicit and implicit, that we were studying in chapter 2 above. Josephus, the Jewish aristocrat who became a general in the war against Rome, only to change sides and act as advisor to Titus, came to Rome not (like so many of his compatriots) as a prisoner to be killed or sold into slavery, but on an imperial pension. He devoted the rest of his life to literary work; and it is through a single comment that he makes on the Jewish zeal for war in the middle of the first century that we see how the prophetic narrative of the book of Daniel was being read at the time. What drove them to war, he said, was a biblical oracle which said that at that time a world ruler would arise from Judaea. Though Josephus does not specify which oracle he has in mind, he can only be referring to the book of Daniel, which offers two things in particular: first (in chapters 2 and 7), a prophetic sequence of four coming kingdoms, the last of which will be overthrown by a new worldwide kingdom… ([Location 8870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8870))

- New shiny buildings dominated the centre of the city, with new temples in particular taking pride of place. The new temple of Apollo on the Palatine, close to Augustus’s own house, was an early showpiece and statement of intent, with all kinds of associations with ancient traditions. Augustus had promised Apollo a new temple in Rome (where to this point he had only had one) after his victory over Sextus Pompey in 36 BC, a turning-point in his own fortunes (it is important to remember that, granted the history of the previous fifty years, nobody could have dreamed that the young Octavian would survive that round of civil warfare, let alone attain such lengthy pre-eminence).45 But the forum, not least the new temples there, eventually formed the centrepiece of the new Rome; it was dedicated in 2 BC, the same year that the Senate voted him the title of pater patriae, father of the fatherland. It was closely related to the themes Virgil expounded in the Aeneid (see below), and constituted, quite deliberately, one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.46 ([Location 8904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8904))

- One could spend a day walking, in one’s mind’s eye, around Augustus’s forum and come nowhere near exhausting its range of powerful symbolic messages. Even its planning sent a message: Augustus deliberately built it on private ground purchased for the purpose, without using any right of compulsory purchase to oust existing buildings, since one of his many themes was the restoration of the right of private property. It was built of materials brought from far and wide, so that there, within the capital, one might walk on and gaze at symbols of the whole empire. The forum itself displayed, all around, statues and symbols which spoke eloquently of Rome’s, and Augustus’s, rule over the whole world, explicitly evoking the previous empire of Alexander the Great and pulling together allusions to older Greek as well as more recent Roman history, with honorific statues of everyone you can think of, from Aeneas and Romulus through to Pompey and Caesar, who had held power in Rome. The new forum, indeed, was set at right angles to the forum of Julius Caesar himself (much as the new Coventry Cathedral was built at right angles to the one destroyed by enemy action in the war of 1939–45). The temples that completed the two open-plan forums conveyed their own powerful message, with the forum of Julius Caesar leading the eye up to the Temple of Venus, the mother of Aeneas and hence the traditional ancestress of the Julian house, and the forum of Augustus himself climaxing in the Temple of Mars Ultor, the god of vengeance, the traditional god of the Latin peoples, invoked by Octavian in his victory over the assassins of his adopted father and then invoked again when the mighty Parthians were, if not trounced in battle, at least persuaded to hand over the Roman standards they had seized after defeating Crassus at Carrhae in 53 BC.47 The whole forum declared, in its conception, construction (down to small architectural details) and iconography the message which Augustus was eager to convey: here the most ancient traditions and virtues of the Roman people were summed up and given fresh expression for a new day in which the great themes of Roman life had become a reality across the known world.48 ([Location 8913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8913))

- Among other notable additions to the Roman landscape, the Ara Pacis, the ‘altar of peace’, stands out prominently. It is sited near the Mausoleum of Augustus, close to the Tiber in the ancient centre of Rome, and though today the Rome traffic sweeps by relentlessly it was originally designed as part of a larger architectural whole, including a sundial so placed that its shadow would bisect the altar on Augustus’s birthday.49 To this day the huge altar, with its carved panels on every side, creates the strong impression of a solemn, devout, peaceful and (not least) prosperous society, in which the literal fruits of peace are displayed in a cornucopia, and a kind of rural idyll is invoked, as in Virgil’s Georgics, of a countryside enjoying the chance to get on with its quiet round of harvests and animal husbandry. The larger scheme, however, of which this celebration of peace forms a part, is unambiguously and unashamedly a celebration of the military victory which brings peace about. The goddess Roma sits triumphantly on top of a pile of arms; it is because the whole world now lives in fear of Rome that Rome herself can be at peace.50 ‘Peace and security’, indeed, are regularly combined: military might guarantees imperial… ([Location 8929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8929))

- On a smaller scale, but no less notable, were some of the artefacts which became famous in their own right. The clipeus virtutis, the ‘shield of valour’, was presented to Augustus on 13 January 27 BC by the Senate, at the same time as the award of the honorific ‘Augustus’ itself, and the erection of a laurel wreath and a civic crown at his front door.53 This golden shield was placed in the new senate house, named Curia Julia in honour of Julius Caesar; it bore the words virtus, clementia, iustitia and pietas: courage, mercy, justice and … well, pietas has long been recognized as hard to translate, summing up as it does (not least in Virgil’s portrait of Aeneas) the combination of devotion to the gods, and devotion to duty, expressed in a humane and kindly life. Our word ‘piety’ hardly covers all that, nor does ‘duty’ itself convey the warmth, and even (unlikely though it may seem in a Roman hero) a faint touch of humility, at least in the face of the gods and of one’s elders (Aeneas carrying his father Anchises away from Troy is the standard image). As well as being thus displayed prominently in Rome itself, the clipeus virtutis was reproduced as a decoration on various household objects such as lamps, where it is held by a statue of Victoria: the same message again, of military conquest ushering in the new world.54 Similar messages were given through other objects, such as the… ([Location 8942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8942))

- Though it is hard to guess how many ordinary people, in Rome or in the empire, bothered too much about the symbols and slogans on coins, they were the only mass medium in the ancient world, and as such are bound to have attracted somewhat more attention than do our own symbol-laden but usually ignored modern western coins and banknotes.56 And the coins of Augustus’s reign make certain things very clear. First, the princeps is divi filius, ‘son of the deified’: that was the first, and remained one of the most important, of Augustus’s political moves. A coin has, of course, two sides: in Roman times, one side displayed the official, legal statement, and the other attempted to reach out to the ideals held dear by the potential user.57 Accustomed as we are to seeing human faces on coins, we might forget that it was only in the time of Julius Caesar that the Romans began to portray living human beings numismatically, and Augustus developed this strikingly, with his own portrait variously displayed, not least in the guise of a god (see below). In one striking image, on an aureus dated 12 BC, Augustus is depicted extending a helping hand to a figure who, kneeling, represents the res publica.58 The coins from this period… ([Location 8956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8956))
- But by common consent the ‘golden age’ of Latin prose and verse occurred under the patronage, and in the central cases the close personal friendship, of Augustus. Perhaps the latent awareness of this cultural flowering helped to give currency to the idea of a ‘golden age’ in more general terms.60 Many writers in antiquity reflected on the possibility of understanding history as a succession of different periods: gold, silver, bronze and iron being one regular sequence.61 Horace, especially in his Odes, is often called as a first witness to this; his poetic gifts came to fullest fruition more or less exactly at the same time as Augustus completed his initial rise to power. He celebrates Augustus’s victory over Cleopatra, his various other military successes, and his splendid return to Rome.62 Nor is this merely a series of detached glories. Horace lists the heroes of long ago, leading up at last to Augustus, who, he prays, will rule the world as Jupiter’s viceroy. Augustus will do justice on earth while Jupiter does the same from heaven.63 This is a narrative, with Augustus as its climax.

- This is if anything even clearer in his Carmen Saeculare, ‘Hymn for a New Age’, written to be performed at the ‘secular games’ revived by Augustus in 17 BC, at a very specific moment in his programme of reform and renewal. The Parthians had come to terms; the Spanish Cantabrians had been subdued; Augustus’s own severe programme of moral legislation had been laid down. This was the dawn of a new age all right, but not one of indolent luxury. Only if the ordinary Romans were prepared to live up to the ancient ideals, and to work hard, would it come about, so that the tradition of the saeculum, here seen as a hundred and ten years, would be maintained in the future:64 … grant success to the Fathers’ edicts on the yoking together of men and women and on the marriage law for raising a new crop of children, so that the unfailing cycle of ten times eleven years may bring round singing and games that are thronged with people three times by daylight and as often in the pleasant time of night.65 ([Location 8986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=8986))

- It is, more or less, the Ara Pacis set to music. Apollo will see to it all, looking down from his new temple on the Palatine, next to Augustus’s house. He will ‘prolong Rome’s power and Latium’s prosperity for another cycle and another ever improving age.’68 Things can now only get better. With Caesar Augustus now in charge, and his new moral legislation in place, nothing can disturb the pax Augusta: The Augustan age our rich crops reinstates  And to Rome’s God our standards now restores, Torn down from Parthia’s haughty temple gates:  The age has closed Janus’s warless doors.   The licence, which can strict rules override,  Has been curbed by restrictions and commands; This age has pushed both guilt and crime aside,  And ancient arts and skills it now demands.   Through these the Latin name and Italy’s strength  Have grown, her fame and empire’s majesty, Which to the eastern sun stretches its length  From the sun’s couch beneath the western sea.   With Caesar as our institutions’ guard,  No civil rage or force will drive out peace; Nor yet the ire that hammers out the sword  And brings hostilities to sad cities.   No drinkers of the Danube’s waters deep  Will break your Julian edicts, nor Chinese, Getans or Persians who no trust can keep,  Nor men raised near the river Tanais.   Surrounded by the bounties Liber gives,  We, both on common and on holy day, Together with our children and our wives,  After we first to heaven with due rites pray,   We’ll sing our princes’ glorious attributes  As in the past our forefathers have done, – In song accompanied by Lydian flutes,  Of Troy, Anchises and kind Venus’ son.69 ([Location 9007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9007))

- the message of the Odes, and especially of the Carmen Saeculare, remains: Rome’s long story has arrived at its glorious climax with the victories, and the consequent peace, of Augustus.

- The far greater Augustan historian, however, tells a more complicated story, though it, too, lands up by the power of its narrative in much the same place. Livy, like Horace, was a contemporary and friend of Augustus, though he too managed to retain a measure of independence. His vast History (not all of which has survived, the climax in Augustus’s reign being the saddest loss) covers the great sweep of Roman history from its earliest beginnings through to his own day.79 His theme, spelled out in his preface, is the consideration of distant ancestors and their habits of life, which enables one to notice by contrast how morality had collapsed since their day, so that by the time of Augustus it urgently needed renewal. His aim was to tell the story of how Rome had come to dominate first Italy and then the whole Mediterranean world. Within that, his story is full of examples of great Romans of the past who have exemplified the virtues the state will need in his own day.

- What matters is what we can only call Virgil’s realized eschatology. A new day is dawning, a long-awaited time of peace and prosperity. This theme is explored from various angles across much of Virgil’s work. The Georgics, composed after the Eclogues at the time when Augustus defeated Antony and Cleopatra and thereby attained sole power, celebrate rural and farming life. The third poem, however, opens with a fantasy about building a temple in a rural idyll – where the god in the temple will be Caesar.93 The dedication will be accompanied by games and sacrifices, and on the doors will be sculptured in solid gold the scenes of the three victories celebrated in August 29. There will also be marble statues, including – a grain of mustard-seed to turn into the enormous shrub of the Aeneid – one of ‘Tros our ancestor’, and ‘Cynthian Apollo, architect of Troy’.94 The other sign of current events in the Georgics comes right at the end. We hear of ‘great Caesar’ thundering away by the Euphrates, celebrating in the far east the victory won at Actium, imposing Rome’s laws on willing subject nations, and treading the path to Olympus (viamque adfectat Olympo) – in other words, doing the things that would either make him become a god or reveal that he already was one.95 According to one source, Virgil read the poem to Octavian in person after his return to Rome in 29 BC, around the time of the famous triple triumph itself. We may assume that the princeps liked what he heard.96 ([Location 9145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9145))

- But it is of course the Aeneid, one of the most famous poems in any language or time, that offers not only the celebration of Augustus and his reign, but also, more specifically, the sense of a great narrative stretching back hundreds of years and now at last reaching the conclusion which the gods, or Fate, have purposed all along – a conclusion which involves the final fulfilment of a heaven-sent mission to recapture a long-lost vision of human society and to disseminate it throughout the world.97 The Aeneid contains thousands of smaller-scale exemplary moments and characters, from its central hero down to the smaller but still finely drawn individuals, but we never lose the thread (as we often seem to do with Ovid) of a single story which will reach its goal in the end, despite all the temptations and trials, all the horror and loss, which will be encountered on the way. Though the components of this great narrative are so radically different from the great single story in which the apostle Paul believed himself to be living, the overall shape, and indeed the very idea of there being such an overall shape to a centuries-long story, would I think have been recognized at once.98 ([Location 9158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9158))

- There is no evidence that court poets in the time of Alexander the Great told this kind of long story to lead the eye up to the achievements of their monarch.99 The only real parallels I know are, first, the ancient story of Abraham leaving his father’s house to seek a promised homeland, with his descendants arriving at last after many trials and setbacks; and, second, the much longer story which begins with that Pentateuchal narrative but which continues, in the mind and the writings of second-Temple Jews, in search of a further fulfilment which will involve a worldwide kingdom.100 I know of no signs that Virgil knew, or was echoing, either the shorter, ancient Israelite narrative or the longer, contemporary Jewish one. But to those familiar with either, his poem would have considerable resonance – as well, of course, as the dissonance both of a rival claim to world domination and of a radically different method of bringing it about.

- Granted the newly peaceful empire and its networks as a natural way of disseminating a fresh vision, it is not surprising that, for aesthetic, social, cultural and political reasons, Virgil and his work became hugely famous. Parts of the Aeneid were adapted for the stage. Once, when in a different production an actor quoted a line from Virgil, the audience rose to their feet to pay homage to the poet, there in their midst, as if (says Tacitus) he were the emperor himself.101 The great poem was soon as well known in Egypt as in Rome, and its famous lines were appearing as much in graffiti as in the schoolrooms.102 There is every reason to suppose that an intelligent boy growing up in Tarsus, or for that matter in Jerusalem, would know at least its main themes, if not its finer details.

- The Aeneid tells the story of Aeneas, son-in-law to Priam, king of Troy, son of Anchises and the goddess Venus, making his way from the ruin of Troy to the place which has been appointed for him: Italy, more specifically Latium, more specifically the spot which will be Rome. So much we know from the very opening of the work.103 Aeneas is to be the means by which a new race, the Romans, will arise from Trojan stock (though there are constant hints that the Trojans themselves came from Rome in the first place104) and will come to dominate the whole world, knowing no bounds in space or time, producing an imperium sine fine, a kingdom without end. Romans, in short, will be rerum domini, masters of every kind of res, matter or business (as in res publica).105 Aeneas’s son Ascanius, also called Iulus, will found the original city, Alba Longa, that will be refounded by Romulus with the name Rome.106 From Ascanius/Iulus will be descended a new ‘Julius’: Augustus himself, who will bring peace to the earth, shutting the gates of Janus, and will be welcomed into heaven, i.e. recognized as divine.107 Aeneas is famous above all in this poem for his pietas, his devotion to the gods and to his father, his determination to do the right thing, however costly; and this is seen not least in the regular mention of his bringing the penates, the household gods, from his home in Troy, carrying them through all his adventures until eventually they are to be placed in the new city.108 ([Location 9198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9198))

- Aeneas, receiving this vision in the underworld, will not, it seems, remember it when he returns to face the next challenges of his own day. But Virgil’s reader has been granted a clear glimpse of the eschatological or teleological belief which lies at the heart of Augustus’s programme: this is the golden age, the moment for which the fates and the gods called Aeneas long ago. All history has been moving forward, through dark and difficult times, to this sudden new day, and all Romans near and far must embrace the vision and live up to it. The long years of the republic have given birth, however surprisingly, to a world-conquering sole ruler, and this is in fact what the gods had intended all along. The narrative sweep is so breathtaking that we might almost forget the sharp political statement that is being made. Anyone like Brutus or Cassius who might suppose that a sole ruler was out of the question for proud, traditional Roman republicans must learn that the Julian family had all along been carrying the seeds of this moment of monarchical glory.

- This homecoming, this reappearing, this return to the city in triumph, are significant for the development of early Christian language about the return of a different king, as we shall see.118 Aeneas gazes at the shield, and picks it up for the coming battle, ‘uplifting on his shoulder the fame and fortunes of his children’s children’.119 That, in reverse, is what Virgil wants his readers to do: to take his narrative of their father’s fathers as their own story, to relive the glorious memories not only of their great beginnings but also of the difficulties that have beset them down the centuries; to celebrate now the new day which has dawned, and the triumph of the single race of humans, and the single monarch from that race, which Jupiter himself intended to bring forth from this combination of Trojans and Latins, a fresh breed who would surpass not only all other humans but all gods as well in pietas.120 The age of Augustus.

- The means to it all was simple: war. This mixed race from Troy and Italy, this new breed called Romans, was to excel above all in the arts and practices of fighting and killing. Not for nothing is the final scene, long drawn out, the eventual single combat of Aeneas and Turnus, the traitor who stood in the way of the peaceful settlement of the Trojans in their land of promise. An enemy king, a rebel king, a rival to Aeneas then or Augustus now: such a person must be dealt with in the way Romans knew best. The thousand-year story is built on military success, with decisive help from the gods, just as the new golden age was ushered in through the triple victory and triumph of the ‘son of god’.121 This was the story Rome had told about itself, in one way or another, for many generations; Virgil has tapped into one of the central arteries of the Roman worldview. What he has done with this story, however, is to give it historical depth and power, so that the long and difficult development over many centuries is held between two moments, the decisive and characteristic beginning and the equally decisive and characteristic climax.

The political agenda is obvious, but that doesn’t mean that the conception and execution of the Aeneid was any less than brilliant.

- Part of the point of the long build-up to this section of this chapter – through philosophy and religion, and now through the story of the rise of Augustus – is the necessary attempt to ground the possible interaction of Paul with the Roman empire more securely in the actual realities, so far as we can assess them, of Roman life and culture, including ‘cult’, in the areas where he went to work. Most of Paul’s work was in cities where the influence of Rome had been strong for at least half a century, in some cases much longer. What happened in those cities was not identical to what happened in Rome; but what had happened in Rome, particularly under Augustus, was the crucial underlying factor for what happened everywhere else. When Rome lifted her little finger, many in the provinces sprang to attention; when Rome sneezed, faraway lands caught pneumonia.

- But not at the same rate, or in the same way. This is why the late Simon Price, who in a measure started the present chain of scholarly events, wrote subsequently that ‘there was no such thing as the “imperial cult”.’ He offered a powerful and evocative explanation: what before had been a ‘religion of place’, the ‘place’ in question being Rome, had been adapted to accommodate the figure of the emperor: The religion of place was now restructured round a person. But it is misleading to categorize this as “the imperial cult”. The term arbitrarily separates honours to the emperor from the full range of his religious activities, and it assumes that there was a single institution of his cult throughout the empire.125 It might, then, be better to speak of ‘cults’, plural, both at and of Rome itself, and of cults, plural, related to the emperor and his family. It is certainly important to understand that, like the empire itself, they developed in bits and pieces, without (despite Virgil) any initial grand scheme. ‘There was a wide range of diverse strategies for integrating the emperor into religious life.’126 Study of Paul, and for that matter of other early Christians, and their relation to newly focused religious institutions emanating from or relating to the capital and its chief citizen (will that do as a chastened paraphrase for ‘imperial cult’?) must therefore take account of diversity and pluriformity.127 ‘If everything is “imperial cult” ’, writes one of Simon Price’s pupils, ‘then nothing is.’128 ([Location 9310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9310))

- No doubt, by the middle of the first century AD, and out in the provinces of Greece or Asia, some of the nice distinctions of the last decades BC will have been thoroughly blurred. Certainly this had happened by the end of the first Christian century, with the heavy-handed rule of Domitian, demanding to be called dominus et deus, lord and god, in his lifetime (unlike his father Vespasian, who famously remarked on his deathbed that he seemed to be turning into a god131).

- The varied phenomenon of imperial cult was nested, from the first, within a larger image: that of the princeps as himself a man of religion, a priest (and eventually Pontifex Maximus) who would himself offer sacrifices, inspect auguries, intone prayers, lead processions and generally set an example of pietas, of what a noble and godly Roman ought to be doing.132 This does not stop when he, little by little, seems to be turning into a god in his own right; nor do writers of the time show any surprise at the combination. As with much else, the Ara Pacis forms a striking example.133 By the same token, even when the emperor was being invoked as a divinity, it still made sense to offer prayers for him and his family, as indeed the Jewish people were eager to do as a demonstration of loyalty that did not involve compromise.134 ([Location 9347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9347))

- Another Virgilian confluence: multiple factors came rushing together to make it virtually certain both that Augustus would be seen, whether officially or not, as a god in his own lifetime, and that cities across the empire, especially in the east, would not only have no difficulty in recognizing this claim but would be eager to endorse it and to celebrate it appropriately. And at that point all that we said in the previous chapter about pagan religious observance comes into play. ([Location 9361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9361))

- There are at least seven different though ultimately interrelated factors to be considered in the preparation of the ground for ‘imperial cult’. To begin with – and starting in the east where by common consent cults related to the emperor were the quickest off the mark – there was a long oriental tradition of divine monarchy.137 In Egypt this goes back to the pharaohs, in Greece to Alexander the Great and his successors in the various hellenistic kingdoms.138 The two traditions were combined when Alexander himself became Pharaoh of Egypt in November 332 BC. Nor is this background relevant only to those who lived in Greece and further east. Alexander had been seen as a model by many leading figures in the late Roman republic; and Augustus himself evokes him as a kind of predecessor in his own account of his deeds.139 ([Location 9365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9365))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Also in the eastern provinces, second, there was already a long tradition in some places of worship of the eponymous goddess Roma. Dea Roma, perhaps conceived on the analogy of the goddess Athene as the patron of Athens, was clearly designed to attract and hold the loyalty of the east long before anyone in Rome was thinking about one-man rule. It is this same goddess that we find on the Ara Pacis sitting at peace on a pile of other people’s discarded weaponry. For our purposes the point is that Augustus did not need to invent provincial worship of Rome itself. It had been going on for at least a century and a half by his day. To slot him in beside the city’s eponymous goddess was a significant move, but more of an evolution, a making explicit of a new but related reality, rather than a total break with the past.140 ([Location 9372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9372))
- The third preparatory factor includes the classic example of Hercules, a human who became some kind of quasi-divine being (the ancients felt under no obligation to be precise at this point), was prominent in the stories well known in that myth-soaked culture.142 Intellectual as well as civic heroes might be hailed as gods; Lucretius, for whom the gods were far off and did not involve themselves in our world, nevertheless hailed his master Epicurus as divine.143 If a human leader, particularly a military leader, attained great success there was a natural tendency to see him in the same light, as seems to have happened with Sulla at least.144 Out in the provinces it was not unknown for Roman governors to be honoured with special festivities, civic games and even temples.145 And of course a statue of Julius Caesar himself, Augustus’s adopted father, had been erected in 45 BC in the Temple of Quirinus, with the inscription Deo Invicto, ‘to the unconquered god’.146 This was of course hugely controversial, and may well have helped to steel the nerve of the conspirators who assassinated him a few months later. But things moved fairly swiftly in the succeeding months. Antony, then holding effective power, had tried to put the brake on the process, but when Octavian returned to Rome and celebrated games in honour of Caesar’s victories, in July 44, a comet appeared conveniently, and was naturally interpreted in terms of Caesar’s soul ascending to join the gods in heaven. The comet quickly became the sign both of Caesar’s divinity and, by implication, of Augustus’s status as ‘son of god’, reappearing on coins, inscriptions, portraits and the like thereafter.147 The Senate voted to deify Caesar and build him a temple; Antony was appointed as an initial priest of the cult.

- A further, fourth, preparatory factor within Rome itself was the reputed decline of traditional religion, and Augustus’s much-heralded determination to restore it. This is somewhat controversial.155 It is to be assumed that at a time of great social unrest, dispossession, reigns of terror, and ignorant armies clashing by night many would forsake the regular, solemn, careful religious routines that had been ingrained in the population over many generations. Following the war-god meant abandoning most of the others. Priesthoods that would normally have been filled remained vacant. Cicero, nothing if not the classic Academic philosopher, lamented the radical decline of traditional practices: whatever one thought about the gods, these practices should be observed!156 Equally, widespread experience suggests that at a time of great social upheaval and anxiety people are often more overt in their religious practices, not less, clinging to such planks as come to hand in a wild sea of troubles. But that is not what the sources are referring to. It is the official, public religiones that are in decline in the period; and it is these official cults that Augustus, repeatedly, claims to have restored.

- The fifth preparatory factor for imperial cult grew out of the ancient practice in which, as we saw in the previous chapter, private and domestic religion had for centuries focused on the Lares and Penates, the former being two young men symbolizing, by this period obscurely, ancestors and ghosts to whom respect should be paid, and the latter being the more usual household gods such as Aeneas brought with him from Troy.159 Together, by the hearth, they formed literally the focal point of the home, where also the genius of the paterfamilias would be invoked. This allowed for a particular, and significant, development. It was not only private houses that had Lares. Rome was divided into districts or wards (compita), each of which looked after its own Lares compitales, the gods of the district, and celebrated games and festivals in their honour. Augustus reorganized the districts, 265 of them, and rebuilt the main temple of the Lares.160 But something else had happened in the first century: the Lares compitales had been referred to as the Lares augusti, the ‘sacred’ or ‘revered’ Lares. That happened a good twenty years before anyone thought of calling Octavian ‘Augustus’, but the happy coincidence produced a big win for the young princeps. These ‘household gods’ of each district became Lares Augusti, and the genius of the ‘father of the fatherland’ was to be invoked at each of them, with a statue of Augustus, or other symbols indicating his presence, accompanying the two figures already displayed. Though this did not of itself imply that Augustus was ‘divine’, any more than invoking the genius of the paterfamilias implied that the head of each household was divine, in the… ([Location 9428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9428))

- The sixth preparatory factor was the phenomenon, again noted in the previous chapter, of the reinterpretation of traditional divinities across cultures. This was not simply a matter of Greek deities being recognized under Roman names (or indeed Roman ones under Gallic names), so that the owl of Athene is transferred to Minerva and the eagle of Zeus to Jupiter. It also opened up the possibility that humans who were performing particularly powerful and remarkable deeds might be seen, and visibly portrayed, in the guise of some god or other. This was, indeed, one aspect of our first factor: from at least the time of Alexander, hellenistic rulers had had themselves portrayed in the likeness of gods. Part of Antony’s campaign to establish an unassailable power base in the east involved his self-portrayal in the guise of Dionysos; Plutarch describes his grand entry into Ephesus in terms of the arrival of that god.162 Meanwhile Augustus had been allowing himself to be portrayed in the guise of Apollo (for instance, in a statue in the Palatine library), in contradistinction to the son of Pompey who still, claiming command of the sea, had himself displayed as Neptune.163 Octavian would hint at that role himself once he had defeated the upstart.164 But it was Apollo and Dionysos that Octavian and Antony invoked as the final drama in the civil war worked itself out. Antony, in addition, exploited the multiple possibilities of oriental cult, so that he and Cleopatra were displayed as Osiris and Isis (but without the implication that he would have to die and rise every year), while their children were named Alexander Helios (sun) and Cleopatra Selene (moon). But, whereas Antony did not hold back from public identification with Dionysos, Octavian did not, as we… ([Location 9445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9445))

But now Augustus would not be content to look like Apollo or Neptune. He went to the top. In the east, at least, he was portrayed in the guise of Zeus/Jupiter; and Ovid, living in exile in northern Asia Minor, repeated the point, declaring that Jupiter (i.e. Caesar) had punished him with his thunderbolt.165 Even if this was a vain… ([Location 9462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9462))
- The seventh and final preparatory point has to do with the way the Romans governed their subject nations. They always much preferred to rule through local elites, rather than having to come in themselves with their own magistrates and officials.166 The local elites could count on Roman support where necessary, but Rome saw the wisdom of allowing people who understood the region and its inhabitants to make the detailed decisions, or – to look at it the other way round – of getting someone else to do the dirty work. However one sees that question, the point remains that the local elites naturally had a strong vested interest in keeping Rome happy. (An obvious example would be Herod the Great in Judaea: see below.) Their own power, which might well have been shaky or even impossible without Roman support, depended on that goodwill. So expressions of gratitude to Rome and to Caesar for all the benefits they had brought to the city, the region or the country were routine, and routinely lavish. If and when the possibility of new honours for Rome and/or the emperor were to emerge, it would be only natural for such provincial rulers to be eager in developing and propagating them. It would, after all, be good (they would say) for everybody: for the… ([Location 9467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9467))

- The studied reticence in relation to official cult has Augustus being portrayed in, almost literally, a liminal position. This is so, as we noticed, in the Pantheon; it is also so on the so-called Belvedere altar, dating to the last decade or so BC. None of the iconography says ‘Augustus is now divine’; all of it says, ‘He stands closer to divinity than the rest of us.’169 ([Location 9483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9483))

- He did however permit, towards the end of his life, an altar at which the four main priestly colleges sacrificed to the numen of Augustus. This could be taken to mean, granted the other evidence, that such a cult did not after all really count as an acknowledgment of divinity (though normally numen would point in that direction, as opposed to genius which an ordinary mortal would possess); or it could be seen as the thin end of a wedge that everybody could see was in due course to be driven further.171 But if we lift our eyes even for a moment from such small details to Augustus’s larger works across the city as a whole, things were becoming clear: ‘the superhuman nature of the princeps might be assumed, even if not explicitly displayed.’172 ([Location 9489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9489))

- The most interesting evidence for developments in Rome itself, some of which we have already glanced at, comes from the poets. Virgil pulls no punches: Augustus is striding along the road that will take him up to join the Olympians.173 Apollo hails Iulus, Aeneas’s son, as ‘son of gods and sire of gods to be’.174 Virgil cherishes a fantasy of building a temple for Caesar, decorated with the story of his mighty deeds.175 Clearly, for him, Augustus is divine, with the only question being whether he will be a god of sea or land.176 ([Location 9496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9496))

- Horace, meanwhile, ponders which god he should invoke to halt the collapse of the Roman world. Perhaps Apollo will come, he says, or maybe Venus, or even Mars, once he’s become tired of all that fighting. Or maybe, he says, addressing Mercury, it will be you, daring To fly down and change your own form to the frame Of a young man on earth, and, braving the danger, To suffer the people to give you the name  Of Caesar’s avenger.177 Augustus, in other words, coming to take vengeance on Brutus and Cassius, is to be seen as the embodiment of the god. Horace beseeches him not to return to heaven too soon, but rather stay to be hailed as father and prince (pater atque princeps) and to take revenge, too, on the Parthians. ‘That will happen,’ he says, ‘under your leadership, Caesar’: te duce, Caesar.178 Caesar is Jupiter’s vice-regent, sent to rule over the whole world, as far as India and China, and taking his place ‘among the stars’ and Jupiter’s heavenly council.179 He will join the divine company of Hercules and Pollux.180 Once the furthest reaches of the world (Britain and Persia) have been brought under Roman rule, Augustus will be hailed as praesens divus, a god here on earth, just as we know Jove to be ruling in heaven because that is where we hear him ([Location 9502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9502))
- The claim to be already setting up altars for Augustus is interesting, because some have suggested that the earliest evidence for such an altar comes from Lugdunum (Lyons) in 10 BC, and from internal dating the Epistle in question must be a year or two older than that.184 There were, however, three altars set up to Augustus in Spain some years before that, probably in 19 BC.185 ([Location 9522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9522))

- Herod the Great, more concerned about the newly acquired goodwill of Augustus than about the scruples of the people he governed, built a temple to Augustus at Banias, on the slopes of Mount Hermon, near the source of the Jordan. It was made of beautiful white marble.190 He built another one at Samaria (Sebaste); and another one magnificent in its symbolic and strategic dominance of both city and port, in the new town of Caesarea Maritima, on an artificial mound facing the harbour so that no incoming vessels (and this meant more or less all serious shipping in the area) could miss the point.191 Inside it he set up a massive cult statue of the emperor, modelled on that of Zeus at Olympia, and also (since the temple had the double dedication of Caesar and Rome) a huge statue of Roma, beside that of the emperor, modelled on that of Hera at Argos. All this could scarcely have been a more explicit statement of a claim which the locals must have found horribly blasphemous; if Herod was, as has been suggested, working on the Roman principle that imperial cult should be able to coexist with local cults, so that a ‘partnership’ had been formed,… ([Location 9547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9547))

- The process of developing a cult of Augustus in the provinces began, as this example shows, shortly after Actium. A combination of (a) gratitude to the victorious leader for ending the long period of civil strife and (b) recognition of the new reality of power and influence led to some swift developments. Two of the provinces in modern Turkey, Asia and Pontus/Bithynia, sent messages to Augustus to request permission to dedicate temples to him. This introduces us to a key distinction of Augustus’s reign. Roman provinces needed permission, as did officially ‘Roman’ cities such as colonies.

- Augustus’s rule has proved a new beginning for the world, and for individuals. He has been raised, as it were, to cosmogonic stature; the Roman imperial system has been equated with the cosmic structures of the world.202 The events surrounding Augustus’s coming to power are therefore ‘good news’, euangelia, a word virtually always in the plural in such contexts, though, interestingly, always in the singular in the New Testament. This ‘good news’ is not merely a nice piece of information to cheer you up on a bad day, but the public, dramatic announcement that something has happened through which the world has changed for ever and much for the better.203 ([Location 9611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9611))

- There is uncertainty, too, over what precise terminology in both Latin and Greek was authorized by Augustus himself. He tried to forbid the use of the Greek word theos, ‘god’, but since there was no direct Greek equivalent for the Latin divus, ‘divine’ (which could be quite imprecise), the inscription above speaks of Augustus not only as theos but as theotatos, ‘extremely divine’, which spoils any sense of caution.205 ([Location 9621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9621))
- The attempt to exploit a possible Latin distinction, using divus to mean ‘divinized’ or ‘deified’ (as of a human to whom divine honours had been voted) as opposed to deus, ‘god’ (as of a full-on, genuine divine being), had in any case been subverted both by the depiction, on statues and coins, of the emperor clothed or arrayed like one of the Olympian gods, and by the use, already, of language such as ‘Jupiter Julius’ for Julius Caesar in the last months of his life.206 When we find, during Augustus’s lifetime, an inscription dedicated to him as ‘to god, son of god’ (theō theou huiō), and then similar language used in turn for Tiberius during his lifetime, it is hard to suppose that the average Greek speaker, reading such an inscription, was saying to himself or herself, ‘Of course, this is a translation of the Latin divus, so it doesn’t really mean “son of god”, but only “son of the deified one”.’ Even if anybody did say that to themselves, it is not clear what practical difference such a conclusion might make.207 Especially when Caligula then came along and made everything worryingly clear.

- At the time when Asia and Bithynia led the way in proposing imperial temples, the inland region of Anatolia had not itself attained provincial status.209 During Augustus’s reign, however, a large area of central Asia Minor was incorporated into the new province of Galatia. Colonies were planted in a whole string of cities across the region, including Pisidian Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, all cities involved in Paul’s first missionary journey.210 Antioch in particular was built up in such a way as to draw attention to its new Roman character and status; a scatter of coins has been found bearing Caesar’s comet, the heavenly sign of the new age, and in one case a large eagle. Rome had arrived. These cities were linked by a new Roman road, allowing for movement of troops as the area was brought under control. And, as elsewhere, colonies and soldiers imitated Rome. Throughout the process, imperial cult in its various forms was a major part of the social and civic organization.211 As Stephen Mitchell, the acknowledged authority on the region, puts it, emperor worship ‘was from the first an institution of great importance to the provincial communities, and one that had, quite literally, a central role to play in the development of the new cities’.212 Each of the three cities in the region to have been substantially excavated so far – Ancyra, Pessinus, and Pisidian Antioch – possessed as a central feature a temple dedicated to the imperial cult, dating to the time of Augustus or Tiberius.213 ([Location 9639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9639))
- Other cities we know to have been important for Paul were also being reorganized. In Ephesus, the Temple of Augustus was (probably) placed in the upper agora, and a new road system was constructed which would lead the eye towards it.214 (In St Andrews, to this day, the three main streets lead the eye eastwards, converging on the now ruined cathedral.) This, too, was right in the area where all the main business of the city would be done. ([Location 9652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9652))

- Ephesus, famously, was twice granted the status of neōkoros, guardian of the shrine.215 In Miletus, the imperial shrine was placed by the council chamber, again offering a new integration within the civic structures.216 The altar at Pergamum has of late become almost an academic cult object, such is the detail in which it has been studied and its interpretative possibilities analyzed.217 Asia as a whole, in fact, quickly became replete with imperial cults of various sorts: Sacrificial activity for the emperors took place in a myriad of contexts. Emperors were worshipped in their own temples, and temples of other gods, in theaters, in gymnasia, in stoas, in basilicas, in judicial settings, in private homes, and elsewhere. Imperial cults were everywhere. ([Location 9655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9655))

- From Asia we work anti-clockwise around the Aegean, and arrive, like Paul, at Philippi. Philippi boasted a prominent temple to the imperial family, and Claudius caused a large monument to be placed there in the forum as part of the cult of Livia, Augustus’s wife, whom Claudius had deified.219 Philippi had been, of course, the site of the decisive battle in which Augustus had avenged the assassination of Julius Caesar, and the military veterans who were settled in the new colony there could be expected to be among the more eager loyalists for the new regime. The likely unpopularity of this with the locals, who had supported Brutus and Cassius, meant that the new Roman rulers in Philippi would be all the more likely to insist on all possible links with the mother city.

- The background at Thessalonica was different, that city being the only one in the region that supported Octavian, Antony and Lepidus against the conspirators. It was rewarded with a declaration of freedom, for which the city gave thanks on its official coins, including one which addressed Caesar as THEOS. Excavations at Thessalonica have not been sufficiently extensive to establish whether there was an imperial temple there and if so in what period. (As with parts of Athens itself, not to mention Jerusalem, let alone Rome, one’s heart goes out to those frustrated archaeologists who find an annoying modern city sitting inconveniently on the spot they would most like to dig.) ([Location 9673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9673))
- But the coins, and various inscriptions, make clear what we must solidly assume: some form of the imperial cult was established there very early on, most probably in the 20s BC. In addition, since Thessalonica was the capital city of the province of Macedonia, and (like Philippi) occupied an important way-station on the vital Via Egnatia, the main road connecting Rome itself with the east, it is highly likely that Thessalonica would keep in line with major centres of Roman power and influence by establishing and celebrating one local variation or other on the cult of Rome and its leading citizen.220 When Paul speaks of the Thessalonians turning away from idols to serve a living and true god and to await the arrival of his son, it would be very strange if he had not meant to include Roma and the emperor among those false deities.221 When he speaks of… ([Location 9677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9677))

- Continuing down the west side of the Aegean to Athens, the challenge of eagle and owl would be delicate: there was no way, short of major cultural destruction, that the new shrine of Caesar would overshadow that of Athene herself, the magnificent Parthenon. The small but strategic imperial temple was, however, placed on the Acropolis, close to the eponymous goddess herself.223 In Corinth, too, where the Acropolis was further away from the city centre, the new imperial shrine was not placed there, but at the western end of the forum, raised up on a plinth so as to be just a little higher than the previously highest temple, that of Apollo. Right across the eastern empire, in short, in different forms but with an overarching shape and focus, people began to… ([Location 9687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9687))

- ‘Benefaction’, indeed, was a major theme of the cult and its motivation; in a world where a great deal of social life consisted of ‘benefactions’ and the obligations they incurred, Augustus was the greatest ‘benefactor’ of all, and was to be repaid in the appropriate manner.225 And all this eager repaying amounted to a massive reordering of the public world, and also importantly the world of the imagination, for one community after another right across the world of the eastern Mediterranean.

- In all this, as with the empire itself, we are not looking at a single, thought-out policy, ruthlessly imposed, relentlessly implemented. The Romans were capable of doing that in other spheres – tax collection, for example, and the rights and duties of magistrates – but they did not do it in matters of religion. In religion, for the most part, things worked as they did in culture at large: in this period, ‘Roman power and Greek culture engender radical transformations of society and economy; but there is no reason to see them as suppressing or substituting local identity.’226 The seven factors listed… ([Location 9701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9701))

- To be sure, in many places there was an easy coexistence. Obviously Athene still presided over Athens, and Artemis over Ephesus; even Augustus would not displace these great names, and since they were female goddesses there was no question of they and he being assimilated. The imperial family seem to have taken their place along with the shrine of Demeter in Ephesus, which may have meant that they were involved also in the ‘mysteries’ of that cult.230 There is evidence for a combination of imperial cult with the worship of Asclepius at Pergamon, with the epithet Sōtēr, ‘saviour’, being transferred from the god of healing to the new god of empire.231 There is evidence that Aphrodisias celebrated the relationship between the local goddess Aphrodite (Venus) and the family of Julius Caesar, establishing a special kind of attachment.232 ([Location 9715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9715))
- And sometimes the new gods did indeed disrupt and displace the older ones.235 On one occasion – though admittedly Nero was out of his mind by this time – the emperor punished the Delphic oracle (for what offence we do not know) by killing its priests and stuffing their corpses into the crack from which the sacred vapour arose.236 Caligula, also by then a few denarii short of an aureus, not only tried to put up the huge statue of himself in Jerusalem but also, according to Dio, appropriated for himself the wonderful temple in Miletus which was being built for Apollo (though Dio may be wrong on this point237). He then outdid this by constructing two temples for himself in Rome, consecrating himself (and his horse) among the priests. He had, says Dio, a lodging on the Capitoline hill, in order to dwell alongside Jupiter; but, disdaining to take second place in this union of households, and blaming the god for occupying the Capitoline ahead of him, he hastened to erect another temple on the Palatine, and wished to transfer to it the statue of the Olympian Zeus after remodelling it to resemble himself. But he found this to be impossible, for the ship built to bring it was shattered by thunderbolts, and loud laughter was heard every time that anybody approached as if to take hold of the pedestal; accordingly, after uttering threats against the statue, he set up a new one of himself.238 ([Location 9727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9727))
- Thus, though for the most part it was true that imperial cults took their place alongside, and sometimes blended with, local and traditional customs, there was always at least the veiled threat: whatever else you do, this one matters. Just as Augustus was the pater patriae in Rome, and was to be honoured as such, so he played an equivalent role across the empire. For all the present mood among historians to be wary of generalizations, it remains true that for most people who lived anywhere in the Roman empire, the emperor’s authority was made present ‘through a series of mechanisms which permeated their everyday existences and constructed their understanding of the world’.240 What is more, when it came to the way the emperor was presented on coins and in statutes, ‘there is a remarkable level of standardization throughout the empire.’ The emperor appears in the guise of a magistrate, a general, or a god, and ‘the repetitive accumulation of the images and titles on a range of media would have reinforced their association with the emperor’s power.’241 In any case, the fact that imperial festivals and rituals frequently outnumbered and outweighed those of other gods, and were distributed more widely than any other cults, made its own point.242 ([Location 9740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9740))

- As the followers of Jesus soon discovered, the easiest way for Roman authorities to get them to renounce Christian faith and profess their attachment to standard paganism was to force them to sacrifice, or swear by, the emperor.

- Thus far we have concentrated on the east of the empire. We have already mentioned the provincial cult of Augustus and Roma at Lugdunum and Cologne, both established in the closing years of the first century BC. In this case, quite unlike the east, it was a matter of the provincial cult being imposed by the Roman government rather than growing piecemeal by local initiative with multiple precedents from previous ruler-cults and the like. What seems to have happened is that, after several years of this eastern development, the decision was taken in Rome that it would be politically advantageous, in the potentially volatile west (a lot of trouble had been taken by Caesar pacifying Gaul and by Augustus and Agrippa bringing order to parts of Spain, and Germany was to prove the biggest disaster of Augustus’s long reign), to take the eastern model and adapt it for western use. This involved, particularly, the use of the goddess Victoria, a key feature of Augustus’s complex religious… ([Location 9754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9754))

- Not long after, both Tarraco and Arelate in Gaul established a cult of Augustus and Roma, and many other cities, anxious no doubt not to appear disloyal and to express their implicit position within the Roman hierarchy, followed suit.245 In addition, the long-standing presence of Roman armies in the area, with their own traditions of strong loyalty to their supreme commanders, will have pushed many communities in the same direction. Thus we should not be surprised that it was the military commander in north-west Spain who dedicated three altars there to Augustus, and his counterpart in the north-east empire, on the Elbe, who did the same there in 2 BC.246 Evidence for the spread of what we can loosely call emperor-worship is found in military contexts in northern Germany and in Switzerland, with weapons, drinking-cups and the like bearing relevant images and symbols. Gymnasia were a popular site, granted the regular occurrence of athletic games in honour of the emperor.247 ([Location 9767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9767))

- There was indeed, then, no single thing we can call ‘the emperor cult’ at any time during the reign of Augustus. However, from the hints in Horace and Virgil to the enthusiastic temple-building in Asia and Palestine, to the soldiers’ drinking-cups in Switzerland, Augustus was the name that was found, literally, on everybody’s lips. The cults worked their way into domestic and workshop shrines, and onto signet rings, oil lamps and numerous other small artefacts.248 Libations were offered to the emperor at every feast whether public or private, a ruling from as early as 30 BC in the enthusiastic aftermath of Actium.249 However varied the cultic phenomena, however piecemeal the development, however ambiguous some of the phraseology, people were doing with Augustus what they had long done with the ancient pantheon: building temples to his honour, invoking him in prayer, offering sacrifice to him. ([Location 9776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9776))
- Thus, to quote the leading recent compendious study on Roman religion: What was at stake for emperors, governors and members of civic élites was the whole web of social, political and hierarchical assumptions that bound imperial society together. Sacrifices and other religious rituals were concerned with defining and establishing relationships of power. Not to place oneself within the set of relationships between emperor, gods, élite and people was effectively to place oneself outside the mainstream of the whole world and the shared Roman understanding of humanity’s place within that world. Maintenance of the social order was seen by the Romans to be dependent on maintenance of this agreed set of symbolic structures, which assigned a role to people at all levels.252 ([Location 9791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9791))
- The cults, in all their variety, and for all their blending of Augustus with other divinities and especially with Roma herself, came down to a focus on Augustus himself as the lynch-pin to the whole symbolic universe. Thus all the lines, east and west and in Rome itself, pointed to one conclusion, which was confirmed shortly after the great man finally died on 19 August in AD 14. Numerius Atticus, a senator, declared on oath that he had seen Augustus ascending, like Romulus, into heaven. Livia, Augustus’s widow, paid him a million sesterces for his trouble. Augustus thus received in death what he had refused to receive in his life. Suddenly, therefore, what was formerly forbidden now became urgent. A shrine for Augustus was at last built in Rome itself, priests were appointed, with Livia herself as priestess and a new college of priests, the sodales Augustales, consisting of leading senators. A golden image of the late emperor was placed in the temple of Mars, the architectural focus of Augustus’s civic building programme. Other rites and ceremonies were voted.253 Whereas with Julius Caesar it had taken some time for deification to occur, with Augustus it happened very quickly. This was the final, public, dotting of the ‘i’s and crossing of the ‘t’s in the message that the world had been able to read for some time. The speed with which it all happened was not only a natural response to the death of the man who had ruled Rome for half a century. It was also politically important for his successor.

- (iii) Imperial Cult from Tiberius to Nero Tiberius was now ‘son of god’: son of the divine Augustus. I have on my desk, as I write this, a denarius of the kind they showed to Jesus not long before his death. It says, around Tiberius’s portrait: TI CAESAR DIVI AUG F AUGUSTUS: Augustus Tiberius Caesar, Son of the Divine Augustus. And, on the back, PONTIF MAXIM: Pontifex Maximus, the senior priest. Augustus had had to wait for the senior priesthood, playing his cards carefully.254 Tiberius had it from the day he acceded to the principate.

- Tiberius began with few of Augustus’s advantages. Julius had freely and clearly chosen Augustus as his heir, but Augustus only adopted Tiberius when several of his other preferred options predeceased him, and rumours of reluctance persisted.256 Augustus had faced huge odds and come through victorious, restoring peace to the whole Roman world; Tiberius had fought successful campaigns, but they were more in the way of routine imperial maintenance rather than desperate, life-or-death struggles for the very soul of Rome. Augustus had been hailed as the bringer of a new golden age; Tiberius was sneered at by Suetonius for ushering in a new iron age.257 Augustus had charm and polish; Tiberius was dour and moody. A distant analogy with British prime ministers… ([Location 9818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9818))
- After some years the magistrates in Asia asked permission to build a second provincial imperial temple. Tiberius had supported them in two lawsuits against Roman officials. They were not only grateful; they wanted to send a signal to future officials that they were themselves in direct touch with the divine man at the top.259 The new temple there, eventually constructed in Smyrna, dedicated to Tiberius and the Senate, precipitated a similar request from Spain; but Tiberius, wary of criticism in Rome, declined.260 Several cities in Asia, however, developed cults of Tiberius, one of them (Myra) using very high-flown language in calling the emperor ‘the exalted god, son of exalted gods, lord of land and sea, the benefactor and saviour of the entire world’.261 It was easier for Tiberius, as for other emperors, if such cities did not ask for explicit permission, since then he would feel obliged to back off for the sake of appearances in Rome itself. ([Location 9830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9830))
- If Tiberius was moody, Gaius Caligula was (at least in the end) straightforwardly mad – as contemporary writers were only too ready to emphasize.263 Tiberius had not allowed people to swear by his genius; Caligula insisted that they should.264 He showed no reticence, no waiting for requests to come in and then carefully considering them. He went ahead and ordered that a temple to himself be built in Miletus, and its inscription shows that he had taken the step against which Augustus and Tiberius had so firmly set their faces: he was to be addressed as theos, god. And he was the sole dedicatee of the temple; no place for Roma, as with Augustus’s shrines, nor for the Senate, as for Tiberius’s. As we saw, some said that the real reason why Caligula chose Miletus was that he wanted to take over the massive temple being built for Apollo, though this now seems less likely.265 Certainly Suetonius reports his extraordinary, and basically blasphemous, act of theological supersession: he brought ancient and sacred statues of the gods from Greece to Rome specifically so that he could have their heads taken off and his own head placed there instead. In the temple he had built to himself was a great, lifelike statue, made of gold, with officials on hand to dress it in clothes corresponding to the ones he himself happened to be wearing that day.266 It was another huge statue of himself that he planned to place in the Temple in Jerusalem, a project only thwarted (though both Roman and Jewish officials managed to delay it) by his assassination in AD 41. The great hopes that had been expressed when he had come to the throne267 were replaced by a mixture of horror that Augustus should so soon have such a travesty for a successor, and terror at not knowing where his wild and violent behaviour would lead next. Oderint dum metuant, ‘Let them hate, so long as they fear’, was his motto; they did, and they did.268 ([Location 9844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9844))
- Claudius had many faults, but radical innovation was not one of them.269 Nevertheless, proceed they did. A statue of Claudius in Rome makes him look like Jupiter, complete with a sceptre and, of course, an eagle.270 In the provinces he was, predictably, worshipped as divine during his lifetime, with temples to him as far apart as Colchester in Britain and the Aegean island of Cos.271 He is depicted in the Sebastion in Aphrodisias as ruler over land and sea.272 He made sure his grandmother, Livia Drusilla, was deified, and immediately the south Galatian city of Pisidian Antioch appointed a priestess for the cult, selected from a leading local family.273 Coins from Ephesus indicate that the marriage of Claudius and Agrippina was celebrated by depicting the couple with the bride taking on the guise of Artemis.274 There is evidence in this period of a new imperial temple at Hierapolis, up the Lycus valley from Ephesus and in the neighbourhood of Laodicea and Colosse. (Laodicea acquired a similar temple under Domitian in the 90s.)275 ([Location 9861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9861))
- Further inland, in the heart of Anatolia, Claudius gave special attention to the recently established province of Galatia.276 Galatia, indeed, had on its own initiative displayed copies of Augustus’s Res Gestae, one of which has been found in Pisidian Antioch, where the new imperial temple, modelled it seems on Augustus’s temple of Mars Ultor in Rome, was particularly prominent.277 One town after another was Romanized and given new names reflecting Claudius’s patronage.278 Alongside imperial worship, games and holidays were associated with the wider imperial ideology. Local towns were able to develop their own style, blending imperial allegiance with local custom and local deities. ‘At the municipal level a variegated, decentralized (but not uncontrolled) series of buildings, officials, and rituals emerged that could be found in any community in Asia.’279 The leading contemporary specialist on Anatolia has concluded that, even in the incomplete state of present archaeological research, there is every reason to suppose that across the region local public life was dominated by one manifestation or another of imperial cult.280 Augustus and his family were the new, and powerful, gods to be faced in city after city. Including, of course, the ones to which Paul went, and to which he subsequently wrote. ([Location 9872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9872))
- Claudius was officially deified after his death in 54, but in the first flush of enthusiasm that greeted the gifted and flamboyant Nero nobody bothered much about organizing official worship, and the temple to Claudius in Rome was only completed under Vespasian in the 70s. The mood of the time was expressed by Seneca in what may well be the most scurrilous work from that wry and sober pen: the Apocolocyntosis or ‘Pumpkinification’ of Claudius.281 He describes what by now was a stock joke, the ceremony whereby someone had to swear that they had seen the late emperor ascending into heaven; and he describes, more particularly, the reaction of the gods when the shambling, bumbling Claudius arrived. I have often wondered whether Seneca, in his older age, came to regret this flouting of de mortuis nil nisi bonum, though it must at the time have seemed hilarious, and very much in keeping with the euphoria of Nero’s first months in office. ([Location 9883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9883))
- Nero announced at the start of his reign that he intended to model himself on Augustus, and his public relations people claimed that his would be an even happier age.282 He issued coins which depicted the Ara Pacis, evoking that world of solemn, archaizing religious practice, the very essence of pietas. Though in some ways, by the end, he seemed as mad as Caligula, he did not attempt to place himself ahead of the normal pantheon. As we saw earlier, he concentrated on his public performances, singing and acting. At the same time, he was celebrated in lavish terms, as lord of the whole world, and as the new sun that had now arisen.283 The Sebasteion at Aphrodisias, in the Lycus valley not far from Ephesus (and hence on the way to Colosse, Laodicea and Hierapolis), was built in the 60s to honour Nero by representing the Julio-Claudian emperors and their families as Olympian deities and as the personification of forces in the natural world.284 Coins broadcast the same message: Such… ([Location 9890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9890))
- In Aphrodisias, again, Nero had himself depicted as spreading the rule of Rome as a civilizing force across the whole world, ‘Romanizing’ conquered peoples as a sign of Rome’s own moral superiority and peace-bringing mission: the further application of Horace’s Carmen Saeculare.286In some ways the greatest contribution Nero made to the story of divine emperors is the strange rumour or legend that arose after his death in 68 (he was only thirty-one, having come to the throne at the tender age of seventeen). According to this rumour, he had not died after all, but was away out in the east somewhere and would one day return. The notion seems to be picked up in the book of Revelation, and it may bear some analogy to the early Christian expectation that Jesus himself would one day return.287 Various characters pretending to be Nero redivivus did indeed show up, but few people were deceived.288 It was Nero’s utter incompetence at most of the things that mattered – most of the things Augustus had… ([Location 9902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9902))
- None of the three emperors who followed Nero in quick succession were divinized, nor did they have time to do much about organizing cult at home or abroad. The next one who restores the pattern is Vespasian, succeeded by his son Titus; both were divinized only after death. His other son, Domitian, who came next, Titus having not produced an alternative heir, followed the style of Caligula and Nero in wanting to be addressed as divine: it is he who demands to be called dominus et deus, ‘lord and god’, a phrase familiar to readers of John’s gospel.289 Attempts are made from time to time to explain that Domitian was not quite as bad an emperor as Tacitus and Suetonius make out, but such comparisons are relative. For our purposes, we note the construction of yet another imperial temple at Ephesus, where fragments of what must have been a positively enormous statue of Domitian have come to light.290 It is… ([Location 9914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9914))
- Looking back across the first century in Asia, we see what Friesen has called ‘an evolving imperial discourse’.291 At Pergamum in the 20s BC, Augustus, based in Rome, was hailed as the conqueror, and coupled with Roma herself. Tiberius, half a century later, was seen as the successor who continued to dispense the Roman justice, and coupled with the Senate (and with Livia, by now a kind of ‘queen mother’ figure). The project of Caligula changed the rules. His own behaviour was wild and over the top; but it opened the way for possible subsequent developments which were previously unthinkable. By the end of the century, in the middle of which Paul came through the eastern empire preaching the message of Jesus, these developments had produced a new civic and religious reality. The highest honour a city could now hope for was to become neōkoros, temple-guardian for the Sebastoi, the Augustus-family. Worshipping the emperors was well on the way to becoming a central and vital aspect not only of life in general but of civic and municipal identity. Whatever we say about either the intentions or the effects of Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Vespasian, the richly diverse phenomena we loosely call ‘imperial cult’ were a vital part of a complex system of power, communication and control, in other words… ([Location 9923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9923))
- Reductive analyses will miss the point; no doubt imperial cult did assist in keeping the provinces loyal and the empire stable, but it also gave shape and body to ordinary life, especially urban life with its feasts and banquets, its public games and festivals.

- This larger integration also applies to the ways in which the figure of the emperor was actually perceived. The overall picture of him as a model of pietas, leading his people in traditional worship while also being himself identified, in flexible ways, as the recipient of worship, enables us to glimpse a far more integrated world than most westerners have imagined since at least the eighteenth century. Indeed, the combination of an integrated worldview and a flexibility of approach allowed the Romans to develop a remarkable system in which ‘the emperor may have been a god, but he was also the mediator between his empire and the Other World.’295 The Roman provincial temples, without ceasing to be places of worship, often heartfelt and sincere, thus… ([Location 9942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9942))
- It was this cosmology, this identity, and this obedience which some perceived to be threatened by the message of Paul. And, though these issues of worldview (‘cosmology’ in Friesen’s language) continued to loom large in imperial cult, there was also plenty of room for ‘personal maturation and rites of passage’.297 That, too, when translated into more obviously Jewish language, was a vital and central part of Paul’s teaching. And, in particular, the developing discourse of imperial cult in Asia constantly stressed the fact that the Roman empire, once launched, was going to continue, and to bring its great blessings to the world, for ever. ‘The discourse of imperial cults was… ([Location 9950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9950))
- The Jewish objection to the entire Roman view of the gods was not simply about monotheism (though that was of course the basis of the standard critique of idolatry), nor even about election (their belief that they, rather than the Romans or anybody else, were the chosen people of the one true God). It was about eschatology: about their belief that the one God had determined on a divine justice that would be done, and would be seen to be done, in a way that Roman imperial justice somehow never quite managed. Rome’s claim to have brought the world into a new age of justice and peace flew, on eagle’s wings, in the face of the ancient Jewish belief that these things would finally be brought to birth through the establishment of a new kingdom, the one spoken of in the Psalms, in Isaiah, in Daniel. Thus, though their resistance to empire drew on the ancient critique of idolatry, the sense… ([Location 9957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9957))

- Resistance to Roman rule was natural and widespread, from western Spain to far-off Parthia.299 Some attempts at resistance were startlingly successful, like the German destruction of three legions in 9 AD. Julius Caesar did not stay so long in Gaul merely to practice his Gallic accent, and it was not without good cause that Augustus had his close colleague Agrippa away at the wars for such lengthy periods. Oderint dum metuant, ‘Let them hate, so long as they fear’, was not simply the motto which Suetonius ascribes to Caligula, but also, broadly speaking, the policy which Rome was bound to follow across the board, granted its combination of proud history… ([Location 9966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9966))
- First, throughout the period there was a lively Jewish tradition, in the middle east itself, of resistance not only to external empire but to internal corrupt rulers. The rise of the Jewish parties, especially the Pharisees and Essenes, had begun in the second century BC when discontent set in with the Hasmonean house, after the glorious Maccabean revolution had failed to produce the new age it had seemed to promise. Hostility to that branch of home-made aristocracy carried over to its successor, the house of Herod. When, in the middle of all this, the eagle landed in Jerusalem, supporting the rich elites and encouraging them to keep the populace in order, that only made matters worse. Attempts to construct some sort of mediating position, as for instance with Herod’s double act, building a temple to Augustus on the one hand and rebuilding the Jerusalem Temple on the other, may have seemed to some like a sensible accommodation, but such things certainly seemed provocative to others. Looking back through the somewhat distorting (but nevertheless informative) prisms of Philo and Josephus, we can see that for many Jews it was not a matter of being ‘pro-Roman’ or ‘anti-Roman’, but of trying to find a modus vivendi that would keep the peace without burdening the conscience. Of particular importance was the promise made by the Jews, across the empire, that though they could not and would not pray to the emperor they would certainly pray for the emperor, and would offer sacrifice, in the one place where they were allowed to do so, not to him but on his behalf.303 Had all emperors, and for that matter provincial governors, been possessed of the same canny political skill as Augustus himself, the modus vivendi might have held, but that, to be frank, was never on the cards. The various movements of revolt could easily, in fact, have spilled over into outright rebellion of one sort or another at the time of Caligula’s crazy plan to install his statue in the Temple, or at one of the lesser moments of tension such as the placing of a statue of the emperor in the synagogue at Dora (on the coast, near Mount Carmel).304 These, indeed, may have been deliberate acts of provocation, designed to show the Jewish people up as disloyal to Rome.305 ([Location 9985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=9985))
- Discontent in the Jewish homeland did not, then, go away. (Things were quite different out in the Diaspora, with a wide spectrum of Jewish life making its way, and its home, as best it could.)306 With hindsight (assisted not least by Josephus) we can see that the revolt of AD 66, and the terrible war and national devastation which it precipitated, was an accident waiting to happen. Even after Jerusalem’s destruction in 70 and the subsequent massacre (or mass suicide) at Masada, hope refused to die. It would take another seventy years or so, another Jeremiah-like period of exile, before the final great revolt. A star emerged from Jacob, but was quickly eclipsed. After 135 there would be no more Jewish protests against Roman rule.307 ([Location 10002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10002))
- Second, the movements of thought which fuelled these protests were by no means merely the ordinary discontents of subject peoples. As we saw earlier, they were sustained through the symbolically encoded and constantly refreshed sense of living within a large and powerful narrative, as yet unfinished, stretching back even further than the great story with which the Augustan empire had narrated itself into legitimacy through Livy and Virgil. The Pentateuch, at least as read by some at the time, told the story from pre-historical beginnings to the ultimate future of God’s people.308 The prophets pointed to a coming time of glorious redemption which, as everybody knew, had not yet arrived. Israel’s God had not come back to dwell among his people and rescue them from their enemies. The Wisdom of Solomon, the text to which we went two chapters ago for an instance of Jewish engagement with pagan philosophy, and in the last chapter for a scathing denunciation of pagan religion, also has harsh words for emperor-worship: When people could not honour monarchs in their presence, since they lived at a distance, they imagined their appearance far away, and made a visible image of the king whom they honoured,  so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.  Then the ambition of the artisan impelled even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.  For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler, skilfully forced the likeness to… ([Location 10009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10009))
- The book of Daniel became a particular catalyst for revolt, drawing together the earlier history of the world in lurid apocalyptic visions, and insisting that the new day was about to dawn through which the old ages of paganism, gold, silver, bronze and iron, would be collectively smashed by something new, a ‘stone’. The frightening sequence of imperial monsters would be overthrown by a great divine act of judgment through which ‘the people of the holy ones of the Most High’ would inherit their worldwide kingdom. What was more, all this would happen very soon, since the original exile had been extended to seventy times seven years, and that half-millennium was very nearly up (though nobody could quite agree when it would actually happen). Josephus tells us that this oracle fanned the revolutionary flames, and we can see it being reinterpreted and reapplied in the period between 70 and 135. The eagle would swoop down, all glorious with its wings and feathers, but the lion of Judah would emerge from the forest, confront it and defeat it.310 Then, as in Daniel, the one true God would set up his own kingdom, which would fulfil at last the dream which was uncannily shared by biblical psalmists and prophets on the one hand and pagan imperialists on the other: a rule of justice that would stretch from one sea to another.

- Third, there was one Jew, born under Augustus and executed under Tiberius, who modelled, articulated, and eventually gave his life for a different dream of divine empire. The point remains inevitably contentious, but I persist in seeing Jesus of Nazareth as, among many other things, the spokesman for what he himself saw as a new movement which would fulfil the ancient Israelite prophecies, which would bring Israel’s strange, dark narrative to its climax, and would launch upon the world the new reality of which Augustus’s ‘golden age’ would be seen as a parody. ‘What is truth?’ asked the imperial representative.

Instead of the eagle with its talons and claws, Jesus summoned people to a different kind of empire: peacemaking, mercy, humility and a passion for genuine and restorative justice. Saul of Tarsus, born and bred a Pharisee in a world shaped by the wisdom of Greece, the religion of the east, and the empire of Rome, came to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was Israel’s Messiah and the world’s true Lord, and that this Jesus had called him, Saul, to take the ‘good news’ of his death, resurrection and universal lordship into the world of… ([Location 10047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10047))

- The model I have adopted proposes that we should ask about praxis and symbol and story and question, and should allow each of those microscopes to sweep and swoop around the territory, opening up the husks of history to discover the smooth marvels of worldview-ingredients within.1 These, as we have already seen, inform, generate and give flavour to culture on the one hand and worship on the other; not that these two are at opposite ends of any particular scale, but rather that they need to be studied in interpenetration as well as in isolation. The whole rich mixture then emerges in one direction in the form of what I have called ‘basic beliefs’ and ‘consequent beliefs’, and in another direction in the form of ‘aims’ and ‘intentions’, all these again being linked in complex patterns and sustaining the concrete choices and actions of a society and an individual. This, by the way, offers a completely different way in to those hoary old questions of ‘indicative’ and ‘imperative’, of ‘theology’ and ‘ethics’, that have been so characteristic of the study of the early Christian writings.

- It is in the category of ‘beliefs’, of course, that we expect to find ‘theology’. I will be bracketing out ‘theology’ as such in this part of the book, saving it for Part III, because – this is one of the most important things to emerge from this worldview-analysis as applied to Paul – theology itself plays a new symbolic role in Paul’s worldview. It takes the place, within his revised worldview/symbolic universe/social imaginary (or whatever we want to call it), that had been occupied by more tangible things in the worlds from which he came. It precipitated a challenge to his successors which some generations have taken up and others ([Location 10649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10649))
- In the world of Saul of Tarsus, ‘theology’ as a task, that is, fresh exploration of what ‘the divine’ might be or might mean, was something undertaken by pagan philosophers and manipulated by empires. ‘Theology’ as a set of beliefs was, at least by implication, already clear for someone like Saul: monotheism, election, eschatology, with their various sub-categories. Part of the genius of Paul was to bring together ‘theology as a task’ with this implicit Jewish ‘theology as a set of beliefs’, transforming (baptizing?) the task itself in the process while unpacking and explaining the beliefs in a radically new direction – though claiming, and trying to demonstrate, that this new direction was in fact a thoroughly Jewish, scripturally based exploration of the one God, his people and his plans. For Paul, the method and the means by which task and beliefs alike were transformed was Jesus himself, the crucified and risen Messiah, son of God and lord, and the ‘spirit of the son’ which the one God had poured out on his renewed people.

- Having spoken of four elements in the worldview-analysis, I propose in this opening chapter to deal with two together: symbol and praxis. This is not for want of material, to pad out two otherwise thin analyses.

- Worldview elements are things we take for granted, things we do or use or see or say unreflectively because they are part of the furniture we only notice if someone has rearranged it, part of the wallpaper we only ‘see’ if somebody has replaced it or splashed paint on it. To change the metaphor, worldview elements, though usually out of sight, become loadbearing, like the deep, hidden foundations of a house. Shake them, and we experience a mental or emotional earthquake; remove them, and the house collapses: we don’t know who we are any more. It is almost as if we had died and woken up in a whole new world – which is, of course, what Paul said of himself, and reminded other early Messiah-people that they should expect to have to say of themselves.

- Ed Sanders, in a splendid recent passage, speaks energetically of the fact that, despite the bookishness of so much Pauline study, Paul himself spent years of his life on the road, carrying (presumably on pack animals) his tent, clothing and tools – not many scrolls, if any. He carried the Bible safely tucked away in his head, where it belongs. As an apostle, he often supported himself by plying his trade. He was busy, traveling, working with his hands, winning people for Christ, shepherding or coping with his converts, responding to questions and problems. And he was very human; he knew not only fighting without but also fears within (2 Cor. 7:5). Paul the completely confident academic and systematic theologian – sitting at his desk, studying the Bible, working out a system, perfect and consistent in all its parts, unchanging over a period of thirty years, no matter how many new experiences he and his churches had – is an almost inhuman character, either a thinking machine or the fourth person of the Trinity. The real Paul knew anger, joy, depression, triumph, and anguish; he reacted, he overreacted, he repented, he apologized, he flattered and cajoled, he rebuked and threatened, he argued this way and that way: he did everything he could think of in order to win some.6 ([Location 10689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10689))

- The worldview elements of Judaism were, as we saw, tightly woven together. Temple, Torah, land, family, ‘zeal’, prayer, scripture – all fitted together in a multi-dimensional interlocking model, reinforcing one another at point after point. Think of a family going up to Jerusalem at Passover: singing psalms which told the story of God’s goodness to Israel, travelling through the land to the great City, careful to keep Torah so that they could celebrate the feast in purity, praying that somehow, even this time, God would act to liberate his people from their long oppression. If we are to understand Saul of Tarsus we must imagine this entire, integrated worldview informing and undergirding him at every point, and we must then notice, with due historical caution but also, increasingly, with open-mouthed awe, the way in which every single element of this complex whole was reworked, rethought, re-expressed in Paul the apostle. Here, I suggest, is the fundamental answer to the puzzle John Barclay articulates in his brief account of Paul in the context of his brilliant study of Jews in the Diaspora: from one point of view Paul seems so radical in his rejection of Jewish symbols, while from another point of view he seems so conservative in his insistence on tight boundaries and clear parameters.8 ([Location 10708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10708))

- First, the Temple; and indeed the Holy City in which it stood. Paul seems in Galatians to be distancing himself not only from the apparent claims of the apostles based in Jerusalem but also from the city itself. This serves an obvious polemical purpose within the letter; but we should not infer from this that Paul has not thought through the implications of what he is saying.9 When it comes to the Temple itself, however – the epicentre of the Jewish world, even the Diaspora world, the one place where the living God had chosen to put his name and reveal his glory, the place to which the nations would flock to see that glory and learn that name – the magnitude of Paul’s transformed symbolic world becomes at once apparent. You are the temple of the living God, he says: not to the Philippians he loved so much, not to the Thessalonians in the midst of their suffering and danger, but precisely to the recalcitrant, muddled, problem-ridden Corinthians.10 This is not, in other words, a sober judgment based on the noticeable holiness, or gospel-inspired love or joy, of this or that ekklēsia. It is simply, for Paul, a fact: the living God, who had said he would put his name in the great House in Jerusalem, has put that name upon and within these little, surprised communities, dotted about the world of the north-eastern Mediterranean. Unless we are shocked by this, we have not seen the point. ([Location 10718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10718))

- From the time of John the Baptist, and from the kingdom-work of Jesus himself, the whole point of this new movement had been to declare that the living God of Israel was at work in a way that upstaged even the Temple itself. That, I have argued elsewhere, was at the heart of Jesus’ own self-understanding, and the point was well grasped by his first followers.13 (It is no counter-argument to point out that they continued to worship at the Temple itself, as indeed, according to Acts, Paul himself did. Their point was not so much that the old Temple was corrupt or wicked, though those who were running it might be, but precisely that the one God was doing the new thing he had always promised. They were better at living in the overlap of the ages than some of their interpreters have been at understanding apparent anomalies.) This, I believe, is at the heart of the theology of Acts itself, in which Jesus himself has become the place where, and the means by which, heaven and earth are brought together, so that the Pentecost-scene in Acts 2 takes the long-awaited place of a second-Temple scene in which Israel’s God comes back at last to live with and among his people.14 We should not be surprised, as a result, when the major clashes with authorities take place, first in the Jerusalem Temple, then in relation to cult and temples in the pagan world, and then in Jerusalem once more.15 Restatements of the same point, in very different modes, can be found in books as diverse as John’s gospel on the one hand and 1 Peter on the other.16 ([Location 10733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10733))
- First Peter reminds us that the image of the ‘stone’ played a significant role within the earliest ekklēsia’s understanding of Jesus, and of itself. The ‘stone’ which would become the cornerstone of the new Temple in Psalm 118 seems to be coupled with the ‘stone’ in Daniel 2 that was cut out of a mountain and that smashed the idolatrous statue on its feet, bringing it crashing to the ground, and then itself growing into a mountain to replace it and fill the whole world. This powerful combination of biblical imagery drew together texts from the Psalms, from Isaiah and from Daniel, and there are signs that Paul was as familiar with the theme as Peter and the Synoptists.17 The fact that so many lines of thought and expression converge on the idea of Temple-replacement shows that Paul is not out on a limb at this point, and that his drastic and shocking statements about the Corinthians were of a piece with what the whole early ekklēsia understood to be the case: that the central symbol of a thousand years of Judaism had been supplanted by Jesus himself, precisely as Israel’s representative, and by the new community as somehow, through the spirit, sharing his status and role.

- One of the most striking redrawings of Temple-symbolism in Paul normally goes unnoticed, presumably because there is so much else going on in the same passage that commentators are, not surprisingly, dazzled: 5Look at it like this. People whose lives are determined by human flesh focus their minds on matters to do with the flesh, but people whose lives are determined by the spirit focus their minds on matters to do with the spirit. 6Focus on flesh, and you’ll die; but focus on the spirit, and you’ll have life, and peace. 7The mind focused on the flesh, you see, is hostile to God. It doesn’t submit to God’s law; in fact, it can’t. 8Those who are determined by the flesh can’t please God. 9But you’re not people of flesh; you’re people of the spirit (if indeed God’s spirit lives within you; note that anyone who doesn’t have the spirit of the Messiah doesn’t belong to him). 10But if the Messiah is in you, the body is indeed dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of covenant faithfulness. 11So, then, if the spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, the one who raised the Messiah from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies, too, through his spirit who lives within you.19 ([Location 10768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10768))

- The replacement of Temple with Jesus and, secondarily and derivatively, with his people remains one of Paul’s central worldview-revisions, unnoticed in an earlier generation that chose to forget the significance of the Temple within Paul’s ancestral symbolic universe. He developed it further: the Messiah’s people, and the tasks they perform ‘in the Messiah’, are described in terms which reflect the people at the centre of Jerusalem and the Temple and the tasks they performed there. They were priests, offering sacrifices, indeed offering themselves as sacrifices, or, in Paul’s case, bringing the gentiles themselves as a quasi-sacrificial offering, with a kind of heavy irony, to Jerusalem. And Jerusalem itself, the focus of the longed-for centripetal pilgrimage of the nations, has been replaced by Jerusalem as the centrifugal originating point of the world mission.

- The most important, and tricky, was the symbol of food: what you could and couldn’t eat, and who you should and shouldn’t eat it with. As we saw, these two interlocking questions loomed large in first-century Judaism, and the wide variety of practice among actual Jews, not least in the Diaspora, should not blind us to the strong probability that Saul of Tarsus had been among the sharpest of his day in his insistence both on the absolute purity of the food to be eaten and on the clearly defined restrictions on those with whom one could share it. Now, in a breathtaking move, we find Paul arguing, on the basis of Jewish-style, Shema-shaped monotheism, that ‘all foods’ are basically clean, God-given and to be enjoyed if received with thanksgiving, and that the matter of what one eats is therefore indifferent. This is a subtle argument. That fact, and the apparent remoteness of the topic from the concerns of the modern western church, have meant that the extraordinary symbolic significance of this move has often been missed. To say that something previously forbidden has now become something ‘indifferent’, so that it is up to the individual whether they go this way or that, is a move of earth-shattering importance.24 As contemporary ecclesiologists know, or ought to know, the question of whether or not a particular practice is ‘indifferent’… ([Location 10800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10800))

- The question of who one might eat with, and under what conditions, was likewise radically redrawn. There was, to be sure, a good deal of variety on this question among Jews of Paul’s day. What matters here, though, is (a) that there were implicit guidelines, even if they were flexible; (b) that Saul of Tarsus himself can be assumed to have been among the most inflexible; (c) that his new position represented a conscious transformation of that earlier inflexible stance; and, most importantly, (d) that he reached his new position not because he had come to regard the previous one as unsatisfactory or wrong-headed in itself but because, so he believed, God’s new age had arrived through the crucified and risen Messiah and the gift of the spirit. The first time we meet Paul coming at us with full force, in an autobiographical account of a very early moment in the Christian story (the so-called ‘Antioch incident’ of Galatians 2.11–14), it is on precisely this matter. Previously, he says, a loyal Jew would not ‘eat with gentiles’ (again, whatever the varieties of actual practice, this is the point on which the whole argument depends).

- On the one hand, the new messianic law of who you can eat with is to be used to exclude those whose behaviour has effectively denied that they belong to the Messiah in the first place. You should ‘not even eat with such a person’, but expel them from the table-fellowship.27 Such a person may bear the name of ‘brother’ or ‘sister’, but if they are practising sexual immorality, greed, extortion, idolatry, abusive speech or drunkenness they are a sibling in name only. Here Paul is guarding the new messianic fellowship just as strictly as ever he did the Pharisaic fellowship.

- On the other hand, for ordinary meals (we already catch, perhaps, a sense of a distinction between the holy meals of messianic fellowship and the ‘ordinary’ eating and drinking that would go on at home), Messiah-people are encouraged to sit down and eat with unbelievers. Not to do so would imply that they would have to leave ‘the world’ altogether (5.10). If one of the unbelievers invites them out to dinner, they should feel free to go, operating a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy in respect of the food and where it came from. Only, if someone does say, ‘By the way, this meat was sacrificed to an idol’, then a different principle kicks in, that of respect for the conscience of the ‘weak’.29 That principle is itself, of course, a sub-principle of the messianic fellowship: since the Messiah died for that person too, you must… ([Location 10839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10839))

Once we see them as part of his redrawing of the symbolic map of Judaism, however, they make perfect sense. The revised Jewish monotheism which he employs, almost effortlessly, at key moments in his discourse shows where his roots are, and they give him the ‘strength’, as he puts it, to look out on the world, not only of cooked meat but also of pagans of all shapes, sorts and sizes, and to see them, not simply as dark and… ([Location 10847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10847))

First, all those who belong to the Messiah, and are defined by Messiah-faithfulness and baptism, belong at the same table: this, as we shall see, is a constitutive part of his most central new positive symbol.31 Second, Messiah-followers are free to eat whatever they wish, with that freedom curtailed only (but strongly) when someone else’s ‘weak’ conscience is endangered. Third, Messiah-followers are free to eat ordinary meals with anyone they like, but not with someone who professes to be one of the family but whose behaviour indicates otherwise.

- The second ‘badge’ of Torah-observance which all second-Temple Jews knew, and most of their pagan neighbours knew and scorned, was, of course, circumcision.33 Here again Paul is adamant. ‘Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters; what matters is keeping God’s commandments!’ The obvious oxymoron (circumcision being itself a central ‘commandment’), rendering that statement almost Zen-like in its density of redefinition, shows not only that Paul had a sense of humour, but that his stance in Galatians had worked its way deep into his rethought symbolic universe.34 Galatians itself is of course massively insistent, not only that gentile converts do not need to get circumcised in order to belong to Abraham’s true family, but moreover that if they do… ([Location 10860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10860))

- The same point is clear in the quite stark contrasts of Philippians 3.2–11. Watch out, Paul warns, for the ‘dogs’, the ‘bad works’ people, the ‘incision’ party – as contemptuous a line as anything he ever wrote, looking back on his own former self with disgust. The reason is clear: We are the ‘circumcision’, you see – we who worship God by the spirit, and boast in King Jesus, and refuse to trust in the flesh.41 Paul had himself been ‘circumcised on the eighth day’, which he notes as the first in the list of privileges in the next verse. But all of that he had now written off as so much trash, ‘because of the Messiah’.42 Again, this has nothing to do with a contrast between types or patterns of religion, and everything to do with covenantal eschatology: in the Messiah God has unveiled his long-awaited purpose, all preparatory stages are rendered indifferent, and to insist on them is to deny the Messiah himself and his achievement.43 The short mention of circumcision in Colossians 2 points in the same direction.44 ([Location 10891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10891))

- So it is with Romans 4. Within his discussion of Abraham as the father of all believers alike, irrespective of ethnic origin, Paul makes a historical and exegetical case for regarding circumcision as irrelevant for family membership. Abraham was uncircumcised at the time of the great covenant-making in Genesis 15; so, if anything, it is circumcised Jews who are incorporated into a family of uncircumcised covenant members which began with Abraham himself. Even then, their circumcision is an insufficient condition of that membership, just as it is not a necessary one: Abraham is ‘the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who follow the steps of the faith which Abraham possessed while still uncircumcised’.45 As elsewhere in Paul, especially Galatians 3, it is pistis, ‘faith/faithfulness’, which is the one and only both necessary and sufficient badge of membership in the Abrahamic family; and this pistis is defined in close relation to the Messiah.46 Paul never says that physical circumcision was a bad thing, or that it represents a deficient type of religion. He sees it, as had Deuteronomy and Jeremiah and the writers of the Scrolls, as a signpost to the greater thing that would mark out God’s people when the covenant was at last renewed.

- The other signpost to what was to come was the third great marker of Torah, the keeping of the sabbath. Here we meet in Paul, not indeed a deafening silence, but a quite different sort of mood, which we shall have to explore more fully when looking at the worldview-questions in chapter 8. Paul is clear, to start with, that the keeping of holy days, like the eating of food, is a matter of ‘indifference’: someone who keeps the day, keeps it in honour of the lord, and someone who does not is equally intending thereby to honour the lord.47 (The fact that Paul does not actually spell out the second half of that sentence is neither here nor there; it is clearly implied.) The placing of this discussion in among the discussion of eating and drinking indicates well enough that Paul knows he is here likewise dealing with the symbolic praxis of a worldview, and, as with questions of food, he is saying clearly that these things are indifferent. Once more, we should not miss the enormity of such a claim: anyone reading the zealous Maccabaean literature would know perfectly well just how extraordinary it would be for an ex-Pharisee to say such a thing about food, and anyone reading Jubilees or the Scrolls would know perfectly well just how extraordinary it would be for a devout second-Temple Jew to say such a thing about the calendar. It may well be, too, that the scornful dismissal of ‘keeping days, months, seasons and years’ is likewise a way of scolding the Galatians for adopting customs which, from the apostle’s point of view, were designed to separate Jews from gentiles, and had now become irrelevant in the messianic dispensation.

A circumcised male who kept strict kosher habits and observed the sabbath scrupulously but who was known to be a swindler or serial adulterer would have been ill regarded by Saul of Tarsus just as much as by Paul the apostle.50 But food, circumcision and sabbath, as I have argued at length elsewhere, were the public and visible signs of Torah-observance, and functioned particularly as ways of marking off Jews from their pagan neighbours – as the pagan neighbours themselves recognized.

- There was, of course, another apparently small (because less controversial) but actually enormously significant symbolic praxis which lay at the very heart of Judaism: prayer. As a Jew, one could, and should, pray anywhere. Solomon’s great prayer of dedication, at the building of the first Temple, indicated that, since Israel’s God had deigned to put his name and presence in that building, wherever an Israelite might be in the whole world, all they had to do was to pray ‘towards this house’, and they would be heard. Daniel, famously, kept his window open towards Jerusalem, and prayed in that direction three times a day.51 Prayer thus belonged closely with the Temple: one would pray in the Temple itself, of course, but everywhere else as… ([Location 10939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10939))

- Paul has rethought, reworked and revised this central symbolic praxis as well. Pray constantly, he insists to his young churches. Whatever you do, do it with thanksgiving, praying all the time to God as father through Jesus the lord. Pray at all times in the spirit. He tells them, over and over, what he’s praying for when he thinks of them. He is modelling and exemplifying, if anything, an intensification of the Jewish practice. At no point does he specify set hours of prayer, and there is no geographical reference. If ‘you are the Temple of the living God’, if ‘the spirit of God dwells in you’, then prayer ‘in the spirit’ was the equivalent of turning towards the Temple.52 It was to be seen as the awesome privilege and responsibility of every faithful Messiah-person, and every gathering of Messiah-people.

- As far as Paul was concerned, thanksgiving was closely bound up with creational monotheism. God was the creator, so the world was his good gift, and to give thanks constantly was the appropriate response of those who recognized this God.54 But creational monotheism itself had been rethought, as we shall see. Paul had taken the Shema itself, the central prayer of Jewish piety, and had reworked it so that now, breathtakingly, Jesus was to be found at the middle of it: ‘Hear, O Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is one’ had become ‘for us there is one God (the father, from whom are all things, and we towards him) and one lord (Jesus the Messiah, through whom are all things and we towards him).’ This is even clearer in the Greek Bible, where kyrios, of course, stands for YHWH; and 1 Corinthians 8.6, which we shall discuss fully in its proper place, is thus a monument not only to Paul’s daring… ([Location 10955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10955))
- The next most obvious Jewish symbol, which like the sabbath appears almost to have disappeared from Paul’s horizon, was the land. We may detect, in the previously noted references to ‘the present Jerusalem’, a hint of revision at this point; but the hint is then massively magnified when we step back from Paul’s writings and consider what has happened. The land was the central promise to Abraham: Saul of Tarsus will have taken that absolutely for granted. To what extent he would have agreed with some Jewish writers of the period who had already said that what this really meant was that the land was a sign of a far greater promise, that Abraham’s family would inherit the whole world, the earth, the kosmos, it is hard to say. Certainly anyone who interpreted Abrahamic promises in terms of Davidic ones, as many Jews did and as Paul himself seems to have done, would have had no difficulty in making the transition: the first royal psalm picks up the notion of ‘inheritance’ and declares in no uncertain terms that this… ([Location 10964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10964))

- Paul picks up and insists upon exactly this developed and enlarged notion of ‘inheritance’. The Messiah will ‘inherit’ the earth, as Psalm 2 proclaimed, and the Messiah’s people will share that inheritance. Romans 4.13 thus looks ahead, within the complex argument of the letter, to the majestic prophecy of 8.17–30, in which ‘the inheritance’ will indeed be ‘the world’, but the world renewed, reborn through the coming convulsion of birth-pangs.57 This clear statement in Romans should I believe be allowed, with caution, to act as the fuller explanation of the ‘inheritance’ in Galatians, which Paul does not explain there but which, left to itself, would be puzzling: he is expounding the Abrahamic promises in Galatians 3 and 4, and when in that context he speaks of ‘inheritance’ and ‘inheritors’, the natural implication from his invocation of Genesis 12 and 15 would be that the Messiah’s people would inherit ‘the land’.58 The only time in Galatians that he specifies the content of this klēronomia, it is ‘the kingdom of God’.59 I suspect it is the subtly false reading of this in the whole western tradition (where ‘kingdom of God’ has been flattened out into a synonym for ‘heaven’, and ‘heaven’ has been thought of as ‘the ultimate destination of God’s people’) that has thrown readers off the scent.60 For Paul, God’s kingdom – as we see clearly enough in 1 Corinthians 15.20–8 – is not a non-material, post-mortem destination, but is rather the sovereign rule of the creator over the entire created order, with death itself, that which corrupts and defaces the… ([Location 10973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=10973))

- Once we grasp this larger picture – and, though quite clear in itself, it seems to have eluded many readers – it should also become clear that Paul’s entire mission to the pagan world was part of the enactment of the revised and reborn symbol of the land. If God’s original intention was to give Abraham the land as an advance sign, a foretaste, of an eventually intended justice-bringing rule over the whole creation (and that does seem to be what not only Paul but some other second-Temple Jews had in mind), then Paul clearly sees that ultimate aim as fulfilled in the Messiah on the one hand and implemented through his own mission on the other. The reason the symbol of land appears to be almost entirely missing in Paul is that it has been swallowed up in a much larger element of symbolic praxis. Paul’s mission was aimed precisely at declaring the Messiah, Jesus, as the world’s true lord, summoning people everywhere to believing allegiance to him.61 We note that here, as with the other Jewish symbols, Paul’s point was not that there was anything wrong with the original promise or symbol.

- Along with Temple, Torah and land we find family. We shall look in more detail at this presently, because in company with most others who have written recently on the subject of Paul’s symbolic world I am convinced that his rethinking of God’s people lies pretty well at the heart of it.62 (This, again, is without prejudice to the fuss over ‘old perspective’ and ‘new perspective’, neither of which were designed to explore the question of symbols and worldviews.) As we have already seen in relation to the question of table-fellowship, Paul has (dare we say!) replaced the solidarity of Israel, and/or his group of ‘the pure’ within Israel, with the solidarity of the people of God who find their identity ‘in the Messiah’. He is horribly, tragically aware of the enormous question that this raises about those of his kinsfolk who do not believe in Jesus as Messiah, but it is a tragedy, a matter for tears and earnest prayer (as in Romans 9.1–5 and 10.1), precisely because he believes that Israel’s God, through Israel’s Messiah and his death and resurrection, has himself redefined the family as he always warned that he would, and has done so thoroughly,… ([Location 11000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11000))
- this has nothing whatever to do with something called ‘supersession’ or with the strange notion of ‘anti-Judaism’. On the contrary: it is based on, and coloured all through by, a massive reaffirmation of the goodness and God-givenness of Israel, Israel’s call, Israel’s scriptures, Israel’s promises, Israel’s destiny within the creator’s overall purposes. Anti-Judaism, characteristically, rejects all this; Paul insists on it. (The real ‘supersessionism’ is of course the claim that the Christian movement, including Paul, looked back on ‘Judaism’ as part of a world of ‘religion’ which had now been swept away; which only goes to show once more that the category of ‘religion’ is probably the wrong tool for understanding New Testament theology.) Indeed, Paul sees the danger of anti-Judaism coming up over the horizon, as a ghastly distortion of the truth, and he argues explicitly against it. Rather, Paul’s view has to do with the fulfilment of the promises made by the creator God to Israel, a fulfilment which is now, as the promises themselves had repeatedly indicated, not for Israel alone but for anyone at all who would heed the worldwide invitation.65 And, just because Paul has so thoroughly and carefully revised the symbols of Temple, Torah and land, this revision, which refers to actual flesh-and-blood… ([Location 11012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11012))
- Hence, once more, the importance of what can be called, with due awareness of anachronism, Paul’s ‘ecclesiology’. And hence, as we shall see, the enormous theological freight that is carried, not so much even by his revision of monotheism and eschatology, but by that of election. For Paul, phrases such as ‘in the Messiah’ and ‘the Messiah’s body’ were not merely vague ways of indicating that someone belonged to the Messiah, or ‘had a relationship with Jesus’; nor were they general, somewhat fuzzy metaphors to make pragmatic points (the relation of the individual to the whole, the differentiated gifts within the larger fellowship, or whatever). They grew out of, and expressed in sharp and accurate formulation, his sense that the family to which he had belonged had been utterly transformed – put to death and brought to new life, he would have said – through the Messiah and, in particular, through his death and resurrection. The community of baptized believers, rooted by that baptism and by that faith in the Messiah himself, became for Paul not only the central locus but also… ([Location 11024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11024))

- Two other aspects of Jewish symbolic praxis remain to be considered, both of vital importance. The first concerns the question of ‘zeal’, and not least the symbolic and actual holy war, or at least holy armed resistance and struggle, to which it gave rise. We saw in chapter 2 how this tradition of violent ‘zeal’ had its roots in the actions of Phinehas and Elijah, and its outworking in the Maccabaean rebellion and then in the various traditions which, towards the right-wing edge of the Pharisaic movement, eventually gave rise to the violence directed against Rome (and, tragically, against those seen as Jewish renegades) in the 60s of the first century. Saul of Tarsus, by his own account, had been right in the midst of such a movement, the movement to which in fact he gives the name Ioudaismos;67 and the form that his own ‘zeal’ had taken had been the persecution of the ekklēsia. This activity, and the worldview which it symbolized, indicate well enough that if the time had been thought right for armed resistance to Rome itself, Saul… ([Location 11034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11034))
- This time the worldview-redefinition takes a rather different form, indicative of other worldview elements to which we shall come later. Paul the apostle still believed most emphatically that there was a battle to be fought. He still refers to that battle with the kind of apocalyptic language which many Pharisees would have used to denote the ordinary kind of battle and to indicate its theological significance. Now the battle itself has been redefined. No longer is it Jews (or at least righteous Jews) against pagans (and renegade Jews); and no longer are the weapons to be used those you obtain by beating your ploughshares into swords and your pruning-hooks into spears. As he explains to the Corinthians, Yes, we are mere humans, but we don’t fight the war in a merely human way. The weapons we use for the fight, you see, are not merely human; they carry a power from God that can tear down fortresses! We tear down clever arguments,… ([Location 11044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11044))
- And if he can speak thus of the ‘war’ in which he is presently so vividly involved (a war, again, on two fronts: foes without, disobedience within), it is because he believes himself to be a footsoldier in a much larger war, a battle not against the ordinary human and physical enemies, but against larger, more frightening, harder-to-define enemies, Sin and Death themselves: The Messiah rises as the first fruits; then those who belong to the Messiah will rise at the time of his royal arrival. 24Then comes the end, the goal, when he hands over the kingly rule to God the father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power. 25He has to go on ruling, you see, until ‘he has put all his enemies under his feet’. 26Death is the last enemy to be destroyed, 27because ‘he has put all things in order under his feet’.

- This, the central driving passage of the key chapter in his second longest letter, should be taken as an indication of Paul’s radical reappraisal of ‘the battle’, and hence ‘the zeal’ with which one should fight it. The death and resurrection of the Messiah have convinced him that what he had seen as the battle, and the zeal to conduct it, had to be transposed into a larger theatre of war altogether. On the cosmic scale, Israel’s God, the creator, had already installed Jesus the Messiah as king over the universe; but he was at present ruling in the way we might imagine a rightful prince to rule when, recapturing his own territory after long years in the hands of rebels, he re-establishes his dominion bit by bit, eventually subjugating all the… ([Location 11063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11063))
- Of course there are (what I and others have labelled) ‘dualities’ at the heart of this worldview, as there are in any except the blandest of monisms. But the word ‘dualism’ is far too tainted with the varieties of worldview which have set up God and the world as opposites, or God and the Devil, or even God and humans. Such dualisms exist, but Paul is not guilty of them. ([Location 11077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11077))

- And I equally carefully distinguished them from the dualities – to choose a word which indicates something very different – that imply a separation within a robust overarching monotheism: dualities such as those between God and the world (where God is the good creator of a good world, but God and the world are not the same thing), between good and evil (where evil is an intruder into God’s good world, a destructive parasite rather than an equal and opposite force) and between the present age and the coming age (where the present age is not bad in itself, but only in what it has become through the power of evil). And it is hugely important, at this worldview-level, to stress that Paul’s sense of the ‘apocalyptic’ or ‘cosmic’ battle, so far from indicating a radical dualism at any of the ten levels where such a thing would count, is actually the strongest possible indicator of the rejection of all such ‘dualisms’. The whole point of the battle is that the creator God is rescuing the good creation from the destructive power of evil. To call that ‘dualism’ is to misunderstand the most important thing that is going on. ([Location 11081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11081))

- What is more, this radical redefinition of the battle is exactly cognate with two key moves in Paul’s whole theology. First, if the problem has been redefined in terms, not of pagan oppression of righteous Jews, but of a cosmic-scale struggle between the creator God and the parasitic forces of evil, and ultimately death itself, it removes from the pagan world and its inhabitants the slur of being automatically ‘wrong’ or ‘evil’, and allows them to be human again. Yes, they are idolators; yes, they are sinful; yes, they are full of wicked thoughts and deeds; but they are human, called to reflect God’s image, loved by their creator. That is why there can be a gentile mission in the first place. Second, if pagans are relieved of being automatically evil, Jews are relieved from the equal and opposite burden of being automatically good. In other words, if the battle is no longer ‘the good Jews’ against ‘the wicked pagans’, but a matter of God’s victory in the Messiah over forces of evil that have enslaved the whole world, Paul can admit that even the best of good Jews (in other words, modesty permitting, his own former self) were actually, in the last analysis, in the same boat as the pagans they were intending to overcome.72 They, too, were ‘in Adam’, and needed to join the Messiah in his crucifixion, so that they too could come to share in his resurrection.73… ([Location 11089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11089))

- This redefinition of the battle thus indicates, not that Paul was really a dualist, but that he really was not. The whole point of the battle as he now describes it is that it is rooted in the desire and firm intention of the creator God to re-establish his loving, saving sovereignty over the whole of his creation.

- The redefined battle, then, rumbles on through much of his work, skipping cheerfully over the modern distinctions between the so-called ‘principal letters’ and the so-called ‘deutero-Paulines’. God will finally bruise the satan under your feet, he says.74 The powers of this world made a big mistake in crucifying the lord of glory, and they will perish as a result.75 The satan may tempt you through a lack of self-control.76 Idols may be non-existent, but there are demons who associate themselves with them, and you should not blunder into a trial of strength between them and the lord himself.77 One of the reasons we must forgive one another is that not doing so hands a tactical advantage to the wily satan.78 The satan, indeed, disguises himself as an angel of light, and those who are doing his work cloak themselves similarly.79 The same satan was allowed to put a thorn in Paul’s flesh, to keep him from being too elated.80 The ‘ruler of the power of the air’ was in charge of all humans, Jew and gentile alike, but God’s action in the Messiah has overthrown this rule, and now the ekklēsia itself, in all its polychrome glory, is a sign to ‘the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places’ of the wisdom of God, the wisdom made known in creation and new creation.81 The battle continues, and the weapons to be used include those worn by God himself, or the Messiah.82 All the powers in heaven and on earth were, after all, made in, through and for the Messiah, and have been reconciled similarly; when they rebelled, they were disarmed and defeated on the Messiah’s cross, and he has celebrated his triumph over them.83 The satan may block our way when we make our travel plans, but God is greater.84 And as for ‘the lawless one’, to whom the satan gives his power: he will be condemned and overthrown.85 It is a remarkably consistent picture, reflected directly in almost all the letters.

- The final Jewish symbol to be examined here, as an element which Paul reworked and revised, is scripture itself – which surrounds, and gives body and colour to, everything else. Scripture was central to the world of the Jews. As that world became more complex through the time in Babylon and all that followed, so, increasingly, scripture – not just Torah, the Five Books, providing the key symbolic elements of the worldview, but also the Prophets and the Writings, particularly the Psalms – shaped and formed the people both resident in the land, worshipping in the Temple itself and spread in dispersion across the world. I have already described how, though scripture was of course put to many different kinds of use by the many varieties of Jewish life in this period, one central strand of these uses was to see scripture as the great, controlling story through which Israel understood its own existence: to see it, indeed, as a story in search of an ending, an ending whose shape and content would not be in doubt (the fulfilment of the promises, the coming of the Messiah and so forth) but whose conditions, and hence whose timing, were open not just to doubt but to centuries of agonized searching and questioning.

Perhaps it would be the search for, and discovery of, a deeper Wisdom, the wisdom through which the creator had made the world in the first place. Perhaps it would be a sudden vision.

- At the heart of the apostle’s reworking of this central Jewish symbol of ‘apocalyptic’, of a new ‘revelation’ which would make sense of the puzzling as-yet-unfinished narrative, was his belief, stated again and again, that in Jesus the Messiah Israel’s God had ‘unveiled’ or ‘revealed’ or ‘manifested’ something which enabled Paul at last to read Israel’s scriptures with a sense of closure, a sense of an ending that made sense of the beginning (Abraham, and behind him Adam) and of everything in between as well. We can, if we wish, give this revision of Israel’s key symbol (scripture) the name ‘apocalyptic’, provided we realize that that term should then carry no more and no less than we have already put into it.

These had all been things which said, at a worldview-level (i.e. at the level one does not normally talk about, but which informs everything else one thinks, says and does), ‘This is who we are: we are the people of the creator God.’ The Pauline transformations said, in effect, ‘This is who we are: we are the transformed, messianic people of God.’ And, because the cross and resurrection were the key things that now redefined the Messiah himself, these transformed symbols said, ‘This is who we are: we are the cross-and-resurrection-reshaped people of God in the Messiah.’ This already points us, in principle, towards the answer to several other questions to which we shall shortly turn.

- In line with what we have said in chapter 3 above, we turn to the question: what happened to the symbolic world of ancient paganism when seen from the perspective of Paul and his proclamation of the Jewish Messiah? The question has recently been raised in a fascinating way by Kavin Rowe: when the still very Jewish apostle gets going with his critique of idolatry, what, as it were, takes the place of all those gods? Once you desacralize a space, how do you refill it?88 Because desacralize is what Paul did. As far as he was concerned, the gods and goddesses of the ancient world were man-made monstrosities, non-existent beings whose devotees were deceiving themselves and thereby colluding with their own dehumanization. Such, at least, is the import not only of the famous passage in Romans 1 but of other passages too: 18For the anger of God is unveiled from heaven against all the ungodliness and injustice performed by people who use injustice to suppress the truth. 19What can be known of God, you see, is plain to them, since God has revealed it to them. 20Ever since the world was made, his [invisible] power and deity have been seen and known in the things he made. As a result, they have no excuse: 21they knew God, but didn’t honour him as God or thank him. Instead, they learned to think in useless ways, and their unwise heart grew dark. 22They declared themselves to be wise, but in fact they became foolish. 23They swapped the glory of the… ([Location 11182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11182))

- In these passages, Paul has not ‘revised’ or ‘rethought’ the standard Jewish belief about pagan idolatry, a belief rooted in the sneers of the prophets and the scorn of the Psalms.93 He has reaffirmed it. We are monotheists, he insists, not pagan polytheists! Those who scramble over themselves to declare that the Areopagus Address in Acts 17 could not have been given by Paul because it is so positive about pagan philosophy, quoting from pagan poets and so on, regularly fail to notice that the heart of the speech is a classic Jewish denunciation of idols, their shrines and their sacrifices. The speech is set, of course, on the rock of the Areopagus, in full view of the magnificent Parthenon and the smaller but still stunning Temple of Nike, two of the most beautiful constructions ever erected by human hands. And the Paul of Acts declares that they are a waste of space, a category mistake. The Paul of the letters shakes hands with his shadowy Lukan Doppelgänger across the void of critical fashion: that is exactly what they are. So much for the first, and most important, pagan symbol. There is one God, the creator of all things, and it is a mistake of the first order to suppose that this God can be contained within, or identified with, anything in this present world. So far, this is precisely what we would expect from a strict first-century Jew; from a strict monotheistic Jew who believed that the one God had made, and owns, the whole world and all its ways and wisdom; from such a Jew who has been transformed from within so that he believes the Jewish story has reached its long-ordained climax. God is not, and cannot properly be manifested in, any kind of object within the world of space, time and matter.

- With one exception. Written into the charter deeds of creational monotheism – i.e. the opening chapters of Genesis – Paul knew that there was one creature who was designed, not to contain the creator God (as if such a thing were possible) but, at least, to reflect him. Part of Paul’s radical and robust rejection of pagan idolatry was based on the clear belief that idolatry not only diminishes God; it diminishes, also, those who actually do bear God’s image. It steals their privilege and bestows it elsewhere; or rather, since it is these same humans who are doing it, pagan worship sells its own birthright for a mess of idolatrous pottage. It puts humans below the birds, animals and reptiles. Humans were supposed to be running God’s world as his vicegerents, his image-bearers, reflecting into the world the glory and wise ordering of its maker. Paul’s typically Jewish reaction against the dehumanization that results directly from idolatry was only heightened by his belief that there had come at last a truly human being, ‘the image of the invisible God’, whose aim was precisely to rehumanize other humans, to rescue them from the corruption brought on by idolatry and to re-establish them as what they were supposed to be.94 Paul’s rejection of the central symbols of paganism was heightened by what he believed about Jesus. ([Location 11231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11231))
- As a result, also, Paul found himself analyzing pagan worship partly in terms of its nonsensical character and partly in terms of something much darker.95 As we noticed a moment ago when discussing the redefined ‘battle’, Paul was anxious both to say that idols had no real existence and that idol-temples were the sort of place where daimons were effectively invoked, creatures that could wield real, if limited, power. These two views should not be played off against one another, as though they were obviously inconsistent and Paul was oscillating between two conflicting positions.96 He was clear about Zeus, Athene, Mars, Aphrodite and the rest: they didn’t exist. But people who worshipped these ‘gods many and lords many’ were in fact, he claimed, summoning up spiritual forces, agents of the dark power he calls ‘the satan’. These beings, though not themselves anything like the great and lofty Olympians imagined by mainstream paganism, were none the less potent and dangerous. This world of petty but dangerous daimons was an altogether murkier place than the outwardly noble vision of the classical divinities (not that Olympus itself was exactly straightforward or clean-living): the daimons were, so to speak, grubby backstreet swindlers hiding out in the grand, empty palaces vacated by their imaginary superiors, and reliant on humans to give them such power as they still possess against the day when their… ([Location 11241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11241))

- But it doesn’t stop there. When Paul thought of humans worshipping the regular gods of the ancient world, and being thereby dehumanized, he thought also of the breathtaking alternative: that, instead of invoking Bacchus or Aphrodite, and getting high on drink or sex, or instead of invoking Mars or Mammon, and concentrating on making war or money, it was possible to invoke the spirit of the living God and be remade in his likeness, to become a renewed, freshly image-bearing human being. We can perhaps detect here a hint not just of rejection but of revision: yes, worshipping the divine is a good thing to do (Paul would have scorned the sceptical Academy with its detached philosophy and its going-through-the-motions public religion), and yes, you really do become like what you worship.98 But rather than having your character shaped by this or that pagan god or goddess, why not worship and invoke the creator God in whose image you are made, and find your character, your life, transformed and reshaped by his spirit? If the main locus of Paul’s pneumatology is, as we saw, to be found in his view of the Messiah’s people as the new Temple, part of the energy for that invoking of the indwelling spirit is an awareness that theology and anthropology, like nature herself, abhor vacuums, and that to dismiss a daimon and to leave the house empty, as Jesus had said, is to court worse disaster.99 This is the point at which, structurally speaking, there is a world of difference between Paul’s ‘ethic’… ([Location 11255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11255))

A Roman ‘triumph’ would be one of the greatest of these, with all kinds of overtones of classic pagan religion.101 But every town, every city, every colony, would have its own social life, complete with festivals and other celebrations, in which most if not all inhabitants would take part.

- But we may suppose that part of the reason why Christians were unpopular (they seemed to have, as Tacitus put it, odium humani generis, ‘a hatred of the human race’)103 was that they dissociated themselves from so much that was taken for granted as bringing colour and fun into the normal drab, and sometimes dangerous, drudgery of life. This was bound to be difficult. As we saw, Paul was happy for Christians to accept invitations to dinner with non-Christians, though if social intercourse of this sort for a Jew was, as Barclay says, ‘on the Jew’s terms’, there was a sense in which the Christian equivalent was bound to be, so to speak, ‘on Jesus’ terms’.104 One could go, and eat; but presumably not get drunk, or behave in the way that even comparatively respectable partygoers might behave (not to mention the crazy goings-on we find in Petronius and the like). The question of other people’s consciences might well come up, and have to be dealt with sensitively.

- In particular, Paul seems to have believed that Christians could and should, in principle, contribute to the well-being of the wider world in which they found themselves. They were to ‘do good to all, particularly those of the household of faith.’107 Rather than repaying evil for evil, they should ‘always try to do good to one another and to all.’108 If, as I think, the last seven verses of Romans 12 are intended to outline Christian obligation to the world outside the ekklēsia (as the partial parallels with those passages just cited might indicate), they speak not only of the negative point, not giving offence or taking vengeance, but of the positive: rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Christians were not, like some of the ancient philosophers, to hold themselves aloof from the common joys and sorrows of ordinary people. They were not to give themselves airs, as though their faith made them a cut above everyone else. They were to ‘take thought for what is noble (kala: ‘fine, praiseworthy’) in the sight of all.’109 It mattered that their public life be ‘worthy of the gospel of the Messiah’.110 Though I disagree with David Horrell about some of the ways in which this works out, I agree that we find, here in Paul, at least the beginnings of an outline sketch of a Christian responsibility in relation to the wider world, rather than an ethic which is concerned only for the ordering of the household of faith. And I am inclined to think that we should read the passages about ‘good works’ in this light as well: just because other civic benefactors are pagans, that doesn’t mean that Christians shouldn’t ‘do good works’ for their wider society if and when they have the opportunity.111 ([Location 11293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11293))

- Finally in the wider pagan world, and with the Owl of Athene in mind, we recall the massive effort expended on the search for Wisdom. This is an entire topic in itself, and must be dealt with in its place. For the moment we need say only this: Paul made it clear, again and again, that there is a ‘wisdom of this world’ which turns out to be foolishness before God. This did not, however, lead him to an anti-intellectualism (anything but!), or to a mere one-dimensional turning away from everything the world had to offer, or to the kind of sectarian dualism which retreated into its own private sphere. Once more, his creational monotheism meant that he could freely and gladly recognize the presence, in the wider non-Jewish and non-Christian world, of plenty that was true, holy, upright, pure, attractive, of good reputation, virtuous and praiseworthy.112 The follower of Jesus did not have to pretend that none of the above existed. Rather, such things, wherever they might be found, were to be seen as signs of the handiwork of the good creator. That, indeed, is what undergirds the overall point: when Paul rejected so much of the symbolism of the pagan world, that was not because of any dualistic or world-rejecting tendency. Rather, it was precisely because he valued the world, and human life, so highly that he resisted strongly what he saw as destructive and dehumanizing worldviews and their resulting lifestyles. His engagement with the world of paganism was ultimately positive. He had in mind both the good original creation and the promise of creation renewed.

- Yet I believe that, in the last analysis, Paul did affirm the goodness, the God-givenness, of human structures of authority, even while at the same time undermining, through central aspects of his theology, the hubris, idolatry, blasphemy and other wickednesses which, as a Jew never mind as a follower of Jesus, he associated with the arrogance and swagger of Rome. To say that a particular police force is riddled with corruption, racism or collusion with organized crime is not to say, ‘therefore we should not have a police force’. To say that the present imperial system encourages and sustains wickedness or folly of various sorts is not to say, ‘therefore we should have no human authorities’. (The possibility of replacing an existing empire with some other system lies some way off the side of Paul’s page. In any case, we should not forget that when Rome acquired its empire – a long time before it acquired its monarchical emperor – it was a proud republic whose office-holders, appointed by public votes, were accountable to public scrutiny.) The answer to corrupt authorities is not anarchy. Paul, once again as a good creational monotheist, would not suggest such a thing; that is what is underneath his strong affirmations, so shocking to some liberal democrats, never mind some Anabaptists, in Romans 13.1–7. That is why the poem of Colossians 1.15–20 is so important. Creational monotheism entails a strong statement about the God-givenness of human structures, even while at the same time also indicating that the one God will hold office-holders to account.

- At the level of ‘religion’, he deigned briefly to notice the ‘gods many and lords many’, upstaging them with the one God, one lord of his revised monotheism. He saw the gods of the nations, including the home-made or self-made ‘gods’ of recently deceased emperors, as among the stoicheia, the line-up of tutelary deities of the nations; as such, they were part of the enslaving systems that kept pagans in chains, awaiting the release which could only come through the gospel.114 He says nothing about the massive statues of emperors and their families with which outposts such as Corinth and Ephesus were adorned. Their newly built temples were on a par, for him, with all other pagan temples. The fact that some cities were being redesigned to highlight the imperial architecture produced, so far as we know, no written comment from him. Nor did he explicitly mention the coins, with their basically blasphemous inscriptions: Caesar as Pontifex Maximus and Divi Filius. Yet presumably Paul knew those coins well; the Christians did not at that stage mint their own (that was left to the Bishops of Durham, a custom now sadly in disuse). Paul used coins with Caesar’s picture and blasphemous claims on them: he received them in payment for his tentmaking work and spent them in the baker’s shop or when buying a flagon of wine for his young colleague Timothy. We have no evidence that he ever said anything about them. ([Location 11335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11335))

- As we shall see when discussing his theology, it turns out that some of the greatest, most central themes of Paul’s deepest teaching – those to do with Jesus the Messiah as the revelation of Israel’s God, as the place where God’s people were summed up and their story brought to fruition, as the one before whom, now, every knee was summoned to bow – grew visibly out of Jewish traditions; they were not, in other words, invented to match, or to square off against, the imperial rhetoric. And yet they did in fact confront that imperial rhetoric at point after point. Jesus is ‘son of God’; he is ‘lord of the world’; he is ‘saviour’; the worldwide revelation of his rule is ‘good news’, because through it ‘justice’ and ‘peace’ are brought to birth at last. He is the one who ‘rises to rule the nations’. The announcement of all this is the key source, for Paul, of ‘power’, and in Ephesians, which is either Paul’s greatest summary of his own teaching or the work of a careful and close colleague and imitator, he speaks eloquently about the power of the one God at work in the Messiah, a power which has raised him above all rule, authority, power and dominion, and above every name that is named, both in the present age and in the age to come.117 Anyone who had seen the Eagle at work, and had heard its names and claims, would know what was being said.

- As far as I can discover, one of the extraordinary innovations in the imperial claims of the Caesars was the production of a ‘salvation-history’, a thousand-year narrative designed, like the new streets in Ephesus, to lead the eye inexorably upward to the imperial glory. All those years of the republic were a preparation for … this!118 For the first time, the great Jewish narrative which had lain at the heart of the worldview of Saul of Tarsus, and still lay at the heart of that of the apostle Paul, found a story which matched it, so it seemed, and backed up its claim with an impressive public record. Paul does not mention this story explicitly, any more than he speaks of the imperial claim made by coins, statues and other obvious imagery. Yet we should not ignore the subversive nature of the retold Jewish story which undergirds so much of his writing. If this – the story of Adam, Abraham and Israel, climaxing in the Messiah! – is the grand narrative of the creator’s design for his world, then the grand narrative of Virgil, Horace and Livy, and the visual symbolism which went with those writings, cannot be true, or the ultimate truth. That is the dilemma which Paul posed to his readers. The extent to which they will have ‘heard’ that subversive note is a question to which we must return.

- One thing, though, should be clear. As we shall see in a moment, what was central to Paul’s worldview was the fact of a new community, a community which transcended the boundaries of class, ethnic origin, location and (not least) gender, by all of which the pagan world in general, and the imperial world in particular, set so much store. It was this community, functioning as his central worldview-symbol, that Paul was establishing and supporting even in the little letter to Philemon, let alone in the larger letters which spell it all out more fully. These communities, whose only identifying badge was their loyalty to Jesus as Messiah and lord (articulated in spoken ‘faith’, embodied in baptism), tend now to be seen, by social historians at least, as more deeply important than their place in the usual structure of a ‘Pauline Theology’ might indicate.119 But, seen from the point of view of any sharp-eyed Roman official, such communities posed at least a question, possibly a threat. We recall that a primary reason for the suppression of certain foreign cults in Rome (giving the lie to the idea that ancient paganism was cheerfully and carelessly ‘inclusive’) was the suggestion of groups of people meeting together with their own social microcosmic structure, unrelated to the official structures of the state.120 We should not be surprised that Pliny, fifty or so years after Paul, regarded the Christians as a dangerous nuisance. When we add to this the fact of Paul’s (to us) rather rigid insistence on the behavioural, symbolic boundaries of these communities, at once so similar to Diaspora Judaism and yet so dissimilar, we should not be surprised to discover that they were sometimes seen as subversive, sometimes riskily so. And when we add to this again the fact that Paul drew, for his mature theological expression, on the Psalms, and on books like Isaiah, with their sharp denunciation of pagan empire and their wild celebration at YHWH’s victory over it; when we note that parallels to some aspects of his thought are to be found in the very book, 4 Ezra, which contains the most explicit denunciation of the ‘Eagle’ from… ([Location 11372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11372))
- The previous section has made it clear just how naked and exposed Paul’s worldview must have seemed. Shorn of its most obvious Jewish symbolic universe, and refusing to embrace that of Greek wisdom or Roman imperialism, let alone the ‘religion’ which subsisted somewhere in between, it must often have seemed difficult to envisage what life was now all about. Approaching Paul in this way thrusts into the limelight questions which traditional approaches to his theology have screened out: in particular, the very existence, and meaning, of the community of the baptized faithful (call it ‘the church’, if you like; but the danger of anachronism is especially present right there, unless we force ourselves to think of seven or eight unlikely characters meeting in someone’s front room in one part of town, and a dozen or two somewhere else, with news of three or four in an outlying village; that is why I have normally spoken of the ekklēsia).

- It is still common to find ‘the church’ and related topics tucked away towards the back of studies of Paul, the assumption being that what mattered was sin and salvation and that questions about church life were essentially secondary, or even tertiary.121 This essentially western and protestant assumption, which has been responsible at a subliminal level for so much of the shape of how we read Paul, is not necessarily challenged by the present presentation. It might turn out, in the last analysis, that when we move from worldview to theology we find ‘ecclesiology’ settling back into its comfortable place. Nor, we hasten to add, does this present privileging of the topic mean that we are hereby capitulating either to ‘early Catholicism’ or to some more recent variety of that hypothetical movement. No: we are simply asking the question: what were the main symbols, and symbols-in-action, of Paul’s newly envisaged and constructed world? And we are about to find, large as life, on the basis not of a theological a priori but simply by asking this question, scratching our heads, and looking around, that the primary answer is the ekklēsia: its unity, holiness and witness.

- Troels Engberg-Pedersen, one of the most original voices in contemporary Pauline studies, speaks glowingly of his discovery, through his time at Yale twenty years ago, of the fundamental importance of social history, in particular the intricate and ultimately perhaps unfathomable ‘correlation’ of symbols, ideas and patterns of belief on the one hand and social facts on the other. This has led him to postulate that the whole point of Paul’s thought lies, not in self-understanding (as Bultmann had thought) but in practice. ‘It is social… ([Location 11418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11418))

- Paul does say, in one of the most obvious reference-points, that ‘not many’ of his Corinthian converts were wise, powerful or well-born in human terms. They were the foolish, the weak, the ill-bred, and God had chosen them to put the rest to shame. Some have suggested that the ‘not many’ was a euphemism: none of them were in the upper bracket. But that presents problems. Where did the ekklēsia meet? Whose home did they gather in? Who were the rich who had plenty to eat at the Lord’s Supper, leaving the poor to go hungry? Certainly after a few years, as we saw earlier, the city treasurer was among the Corinthian Messiah-people, and women of independent means were there not only to give hospitality but, in one case, to be entrusted with Paul’s greatest letter.124 ([Location 11436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11436))

- with what symbols, and symbolic praxis, did Paul fill the void created by the abandonment of those rich and powerful Jewish symbols, and by the refusal to take up in their place the symbols proffered by the surrounding pagan culture?125 In sharper terms, how did Paul resacralize the void? Did he, as some seem to suppose (reflecting, we may guess, the desacralized world of western modernism), offer only an internal personal religious experience and hope, leaving the rest of the cosmos as a flat, materialist landscape? Or were there ways he tried to recapture, by another route, the Jewish dream of YHWH revealing himself to bring justice to the world and filling it with his knowledge and glory, or indeed the pagan sense of a world somehow full of divinity?

- It reminds us, before we go any further, that Paul’s vision remained essentially Jewish. The philosophical sects and mystery cults of late antiquity were not concerned for unity. They developed this way and that. People could drop in and out of them at will, or develop new varieties of teaching and practice, which might of course be debated but which were not supposed to endanger or damage the thing itself. Paul at this point is much more like, say, Qumran, with its yahad, its ‘oneness’. However, the unity on which Paul insists went explicitly beyond that envisaged within Judaism, since it emphatically included women, children and slaves as well as adult males. In Mishnah Berakoth, when numbers are being sought to make up the requisite minimum of three to say the common grace at meals, women, slaves and children are expressly excluded. Paul expressly includes them.127 That, too, is the import of the well-known synagogue prayer, included in the Jewish liturgy to this day, in which the worshipper thanks God for not making him ‘a gentile, a slave or a woman’ (at which point the women thank God that he has made them according to his will).128 One of the best known of all Paul’s ‘unity’ texts, Galatians 3.28, seems to be staring this tradition in the face, and thus outdoing even the Jewish stress on a united community with a different dimension of ‘unity’ altogether: as many of you as were baptized into the Messiah put on the Messiah. There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, no ‘male and female’; for you are all one in the Messiah, Jesus.129 ([Location 11455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11455))

- The theme continues throughout the main body of the letter, and indeed it is only when we see the drive towards unity that some of the trickiest passages in Galatians 3 in particular come out cleanly.131 The end is the best place to start: ‘if you belong to the Messiah, you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise’ (3.29). In other words, all those who ‘belong to the Messiah’ are Abraham’s ‘seed’. ‘Belonging to the Messiah’ here is Paul’s way of summing up the several other ways he has spoken of that ‘belonging’ in the preceding verses (‘children of God in the Messiah’; ‘baptized into the Messiah, putting on the Messiah’; and especially ‘all are one in the Messiah’132). They are ‘in’ the single ‘seed’, the Messiah whose incorporating life encompasses this new and expanding company from, in principle, every nation under heaven, and from all social classes. And, we note, from both genders – women being baptized just as men are, whereas circumcision had of course been another encoded sign of male superiority.133 ([Location 11476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11476))

- Paul is arguing, remember, about God’s intention to produce a single family in fulfilment of the promise to Abraham. Well, he says, ‘the mediator is not of one, but God is one’ (3.20). The only way we can understand this – but this way works extremely well – is to gloss Paul’s dense, almost Aristotelian, terseness as follows. ‘Moses, however, is not the mediator through whom God has created or is creating the single family. Moses, after all, gave the law to ethnic Israel, which was only one part of the worldwide intention of the promises. God, however, is one, and therefore desires, and will produce in his good time, the single family which he always promised.’ Read like this, verse 20 stands as a signpost, looking back to 3.6–9 with the original promise, and on to 3.27–9 where Paul reaches his triumphant conclusion. And the point for our purpose is this: here once again is the central symbol, the single united family which Paul is struggling to maintain in this letter, as in many others. And here, underneath this central symbol, is the appeal to monotheism: God is one, and therefore desires a single family.135 ([Location 11489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11489))
- Strong support for this reading of Galatians 3.20 is found in Romans 3.29–30: Or does God only belong to Jews? Doesn’t he belong to the nations as well? Yes, of course, to the nations as well, since God is one. He will make the declaration ‘in the right’ over the circumcised on the basis of their faith, and over the uncircumcised through faith. Here again we have the united ekklēsia as the aim of the argument, standing firm on the Shema itself. The central symbolic praxis of the Jewish people, the prayerful invocation of the one God, indicates that the Jewish tradition points away from itself to the larger, worldwide family whose marker is not Torah but faith.

Bring your thinking into line with one another. Here’s how to do it. Hold on to the same love; bring your innermost lives into harmony; fix your minds on the same object. 3Never act out of selfish ambition or vanity; instead, regard everybody else as your superior. 4Look after each other’s interests, not your own.137 This is not just the practical unity of sharing table-fellowship, as in Galatians (that was the best that Paul could hope for there!), but the deep, remarkable notion of a community, no doubt comprising very different characters and quite possibly in danger of internal division from a variety of causes, coming to share a common mind, heart and soul, thinking the same way, careful to give way to one another, joined in a genuine love, partnership, affection and mercy.138 In Galatians, the threat comes from inside the company of Messiah-people; in Philippi it may perhaps be coming at least partly from outside; but the answer is the… ([Location 11508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11508))

- It is in this context that the more complex and developed arguments for unity in 1 Corinthians are to be understood. Again we are interested at this point in the symbolic value this unity has for Paul. It isn’t just a practical matter (life will be easier if everyone gets along without factions and rivalry). It is rather that something essential to being Messiah-people is lost when the community is split. As David Horrell rightly argues, what appears at a modernist surface reading to be ‘tolerance’ of different opinions has a basis very different from that essentially eighteenth-century notion: Paul’s tolerance operates only within the framework of an intolerance that insists on Christ alone as the basis for community solidarity, a basis which also implies the proscription of actions deemed to threaten this union.140 This is the principle that works its way through the letter.

He speaks first about the great building that is under construction, to which each minister of the gospel is contributing, work for which they will be judged by the coming fire. He then reveals, in all its glory, what the sharp-eyed had already picked up from the biblical echoes aroused by his description of ‘gold, silver and precious stones’.142 This is not an ordinary structure, a house or a civic hall.

- As frequently, Paul leads slowly up to a main statement of a major theme, in order then to allow it to work out in detail – in this case, all the way from 3.18 to the end of chapter 4. We sense the utterly Jewish power of the claim: there is, of course, only one Temple, a point on which scripture had insisted. Ultimately, the shallow faction-fighting shows itself up not only as playing around with mere worldly wisdom when there is a much deeper wisdom on offer, but as an attempt to build little pseudo-temples, or perhaps (granted the one foundation that has already been laid) to stick on top of that foundation all kinds of unsuitable and incongruous materials. Paul issues two kinds of warnings: first, about the fact that the coming fire will reveal what sort of material people have been adding to the building; second, about the danger of destroying it once it is built. But the point is this: there is one building, one Temple, one place where the living God has chosen to live. It consists, now, of all those who belong to the Messiah, all those who are indwelt by his spirit. God has planted that Temple in Corinth, as he has in city after city. The appeal for unity is based on nothing less than the Messiah himself, who in turn gains his being, his meaning,… ([Location 11546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11546))

- Unity is then firmly back on the agenda all the way from chapter 8 to chapter 14, though in at least three different (though related) modes. First, the question of meat offered to idols. One of the great gains in recent scholarship is that the sociological investigation of exactly what was going on here has resulted in this whole discussion being seen as much more than merely ‘ethics’ (and a rather odd corner of it at that). The question is: how to live as the people of the one God in the world of paganism? That is why Paul’s evocation of the Shema in verses 3 and 4 (‘anyone who loves God’ and ‘no God but one’) builds to the extraordinary climax of the reworked Shema in verse 6: one God, one lord.

- The christological reworking of monotheism, which we shall study in more detail later on, then becomes the ground plan for the careful appeal for unity when faced with conflicting consciences. As we have already seen, making the question of idol-meat a matter of conscience, rather than a matter of strict rules, is a major move away from a strict Jewish position, a move which is itself grounded on monotheism: because there is one God, all the beasts of the forest are his: ‘the earth is YHWH’s, and all its fullness.’ Nothing is then to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.148 But because the Messiah, who is now the lord at the heart of the reworked Shema, is the crucified Messiah, the community’s practice when faced with issues of conscience must reflect the fact that all who belong to the Messiah’s family are brothers and sisters for whom he died, and are called to put into practice the fact that their corporate existence involves a sharing in his death, and the renunciation of ‘rights’ which it entailed.

- Paul’s own example – as the apostle who gives up his rights for the sake of the gospel – is then the subject of chapter 9. Again we see the focus on unity highlighted in terms of Paul’s sense of obligation to all people, as well as the fragility of his own worldview since, by the way he speaks of himself at this point, he is himself neither Jew nor non-Jew, but must ‘become’ like these people in order to ‘win’ them: I am indeed free from everyone; but I have enslaved myself to everyone, so that I can win all the more. 20I became like a Jew to the Jews, to win Jews. I became like someone under the law to the people who are under the law, even though I’m not myself under the law, so that I could win those under the law. 21To the lawless I became like someone lawless (even though I’m not lawless before God, but under the Messiah’s law), so that I could win the… ([Location 11586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11586))
- The unity of God’s people, and the necessary holiness by which it will be characterized, is then at stake as Paul returns to the question of idols, food and temples in 1 Corinthians 10. Here he makes clear, too, how the ‘one God, one lord’ theology emerges into practical expression and symbolic value: ‘there is one loaf; well, then, there may be several of us, but we are one body, because we all share the one loaf.’153 Once again, monotheism is what counts (10.26), but tempered by the christologically grounded respect for conscience. And, in a remarkable and worldview-revealing conclusion, those who understand themselves this way will form a different, and differently symbolized, community, neither Jew nor Greek, but rather the ekklēsia tou theou: 31So, then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to God’s glory. 32Be blameless before Jews and Greeks and the ekklēsia of God, 33just as I try to please everybody in everything, not pursuing my own advantage, but that of the great majority, so that they may be saved. 11.1Copy me, just as I’m copying the Messiah.154 ([Location 11605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11605))
- ‘Before Jews, Greeks and the ekklēsia of God!’ We should not, whether through inattention or theological resistance, miss the force of that phrase.155 Paul’s main point, of course, is that the little Messiah-faith community in Corinth should not provoke unnecessary irritation among their neighbours; but the way he undergirds that is striking. This community is ‘God’s ekklēsia’, the one people of the one God, the guidelines for whose common life are given in the Messiah and enacted in the example of the apostle.156 ([Location 11615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11615))

- Chapter 11 forms a kind of transition to the great triptych of chapters 12—14. On the one hand, it picks up the theme of the Lord’s Supper from chapter 10, the point at which Paul was describing what is really going on when someone actually goes inside a pagan temple and shares in the sacred meal. The central Christian meal, then, is not so completely different from those of the other traditions. It grows directly out of the Jewish passover-meal, bringing that long tradition to a climax, and thereby confronting, as passover-meals always did, the power of paganism, whether in Egypt a millennium and a half earlier or in the Corinth of Paul’s own day. Again the point is unity: unity with the one and only lord, and unity ‘in him’ with all his people. In this case, the stress is on unity across the apparent social divisions that are threatening the community by allowing rich Messiah-people to stuff themselves while poor ones go hungry (11.21–2). Whether this rich/poor divide at the lord’s table can be mapped on to the various other divisions that emerge elsewhere in the letter (the personality-cults of chapters 1—4, the ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ in chapters 8—10, the squabbles about ‘spiritual gifts’ in chapters 12 and 14, and the debates over resurrection in chapter 15) seems to me a priori unlikely, though it may have formed one factor in how some of those difficulties expressed themselves. It is not even clear whether the rich/poor question of verses 21–2 constitutes the same problem as the ‘factions’ in verse 18; Paul may simply be highlighting the social divide as one example of divisions that range over wider issues.157 But the overall point of what he is saying should be clear. The Lord’s Supper should be a moment of symbolic unity; and this requires, as does the delicate situation of chapters 8—10, that the Messiah’s people ‘wait for one another’ (11.33). Though the normal meaning of ekdechomai is simply temporal (‘waiting’ for something to happen or for someone to arrive) the sense here seems to be slightly more than… ([Location 11620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11620))

- All this leads the eye up to the great exposition of ‘the Messiah’s body’ in chapter 12. By now it should be clear that this is a long way from being a mere illustration, introduced as a handy way of speaking about an egalitarian or ‘every-member’ ekklēsia but without much wider significance. There are, perhaps, fewer ‘mere metaphors’ even in ordinary discourse, let alone in Paul, than we have realized. Just as the Temple-theme grew gradually in chapter 3, so the theme of a single human body has been growing gradually, with hints followed by guesses, throughout 1 Corinthians (think of chapter 6, with bodies as ‘members of the Messiah’; think of chapter 10, where the one bread signifies the ‘one body’). Now it emerges in all its glory, one of Paul’s two or three most potent symbolic (as well as merely hortatory or illustrative) statements of his entire worldview: Just as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is the Messiah. 13For we all were baptized into one body, by one spirit – whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free – and we were all given one spirit to drink. 14For the body, indeed, is not one member, but many. 15If the foot were to say, ‘Because I’m not a hand, I’m not part of the body’, that wouldn’t make it any less a part of the body, would it? 16And if the ear were to say, ‘Because I’m not an eye, I’m not part of the body’, that wouldn’t make it any less a part of the body, would it? 17If the… ([Location 11639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11639))

And again we remind ourselves: at the moment we are concerned, not with something called ‘the theology of the church’, but with the construction and maintenance of a worldview-symbol, indeed the central symbol of Paul’s newly formed world. The ekklēsia, the Messiah’s body, is nothing short of a new version of the human race. That was already implied in 10.32, where the ekklēsia was distinguished from both Jews and Greeks. Now we see how it works: ‘the Messiah’ is a single body, and those who belong to him, who are ‘in him’ through baptism, are members of that single body.

- The softer but equally powerful argument for unity in Romans 14 and 15 is thus not to be seen as an appeal for a unity across the boundaries of Messiah-faith, as some have suggested. It, too, is a way of insisting that all who belong to the Messiah should learn to live together in mutual respect.160 The scenario in Rome is almost certainly more complicated than that in Corinth, though perhaps not so immediately fraught. We cannot simply divide the hypothetical Roman church into ‘Jewish Christians’ and ‘gentile Christians’, as an older scholarship tried to do. Nor can we easily separate out four or five parties, though Minear’s attempt to do so, a generation ago, was at least a way of trying to think historically rather than ideologically.161 We should always remind ourselves that some ‘Jewish Christians’, like Paul himself, took the ‘strong’ line (monotheism meant that all food and drink was in principle available), and that some ‘gentile Christians’, like the Galatian converts, were eager to… ([Location 11667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11667))

- What is really interesting about Romans 14 is the fact that nowhere in the chapter does Paul mention ‘Jews’ or ‘gentiles’ at all. This may be partly because, as I have suggested, the actual or potential divisions in the Roman church do not correspond to ethnic backgrounds, but I think it is more likely to be because, exactly in line with the breathtaking realignment indicated by 1 Corinthians 10.32, Paul does not want his addressees to see themselves as basically ‘Jews’ and ‘gentiles’ at all, but as Messiah-people.

- Those who are used to reading and pondering Romans 9—11 may forget how striking it is that here Paul suddenly speaks so explicitly of Jews and Gentiles, rather than addressing the ekklēsia as a whole in a way calculated to engender the new single identity in the Messiah. This sudden, dramatic dropping of the normal viewpoint reminds me of a solemn occasion at school when I was fifteen years old. One day our French teacher, who for six months had spoken no word of English in class, came in and told us, in English, that he thought we were the worst French set he had taught for twenty years. We shivered in our shoes. He wasn’t supposed to speak in English! When we were with him we lived in the fictive identity of being Francophone, of thinking in French! I didn’t know about worldviews then, but he had spent six months creating a worldview in that room, and had just stepped out of it, no doubt for effect. It worked.

- But in the final movement, chapters 12—16, he addresses the ekklēsia as what it actually is, in the world of (what the sociologists call) fictive kinship which the gospel has generated and which he has expounded all through: the new humanity, among whom some prefer to eat only vegetables while others are happy to eat meat. Again, as with 1 Corinthians 8, the move to consider something previously forbidden as now adiaphora (‘things indifferent’) marks a major shift of worldview, which demands that a new loadbearing pillar should take the place of those that were there before. And, again as with the Corinthian exposition, the ekklēsia itself is the new loadbearing pillar, with its roots firmly in messianic monotheism. Observe the almost kaleidoscopic to-and-fro between the lord and the one God, with God’s people making up the complete consort dancing together: 3The one who eats should not despise the one who does not, and the one who does not should not condemn the one who does – because God has welcomed them. 4Who do you think you are to judge someone else’s servants? They stand or fall before their own lord. And stand they will, because the lord can make them stand. 5One person reckons one day more important than another. Someone else regards all days as equally important. Each person must make up their own mind. 6The one who celebrates the day does so in honour of the lord, just as the one who eats does so in honour of the lord, since they give thanks to God. The one who does not eat, too, is abstaining in honour of the lord, and likewise gives thanks to God. 7None of us lives to ourselves; none of us dies to ourselves. 8If we live, we live to the lord, and if we die, we die to the lord.

- It is only then, once the point has been thoroughly made, that Paul can sum up the whole theology of the letter in an explicit appeal for a combined Jew/gentile worship. That has been the point all along: to bring all humanity together in a new song of united praise. Thus he sums up the entire narrative of God’s saving purposes: 7Welcome one another, therefore, as the Messiah has welcomed you, to God’s glory. 8Let me tell you why: the Messiah became a servant of the circumcised people in order to demonstrate the truthfulness of God – that is, to confirm the promises to the patriarchs, 9and to bring the nations to praise God for his mercy. As the Bible says:  That is why I will praise you among the nations,  and will sing of your name. 10And again it says,  Rejoice, you nations, with his people.166 11And again,  Praise the Lord, all nations,  And let all the peoples sing his praise. 12And Isaiah says once more:  There shall be the root of Jesse,  the one who rises up to rule the nations;  the nations shall hope in him. 13May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the holy spirit.167 In other words: this is the moment when we can stand back and see the full sweep of the prophetic and messianic narrative. It is no accident that Deuteronomy 32 and Isaiah 11 occur here, where Paul is drawing all his threads together. The scriptural story generates a single worldwide people praising the God of Israel, the creator.… ([Location 11723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11723))
- The reason for this, we note once more, has nothing to do with their being stupid, crass, or ‘material’, still less because they are part of a ‘religion’ which is now shown to be inferior to the new one; still less because they encourage Pelagianism. Those old and unworthy slurs have come about when people have taken Paul’s conclusion and fitted it on to a different argument. The markers of Paul’s ancestral Judaism fall away, as far as the ekklēsia is concerned, because God has done at last the great thing which he had promised to the patriarchs, the thing for which Moses, the Psalms and the prophets… ([Location 11746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11746))

- Perhaps the most important point is that Paul saw God’s messianic people as a family. They were siblings, brothers and sisters. We are used to that latter phrase in a fairly generalized sense, said (for instance) by a preacher or even a politician who is happy to use the language but who would be alarmed if the audience took up the implicit offer and assumed a real commonality of home, business and livelihood. That would accurately reflect ‘brothers and sisters’ in a first-century context, but hardly in today’s western world. As we mentioned a moment ago, sociologists speak of this sort of thing in terms of ‘fictive kinship’: we know we are not blood relations, but we are going to speak and act as if we were. (Actually, that was very common in the first-century Roman world: Caesar Augustus, who quite literally made his name by being the ‘son’ of the divine Julius Caesar, was adopted, and took care to make sure Caesar’s actual sons did not long survive to challenge his claim.) This idea of a fictive family was itself a kind of adoption precisely into the historical people of Israel, as Paul’s great expositions of Abraham and his family indicate, despite the host of unwilling readers.170 And what the fictive family shares is koinōnia, one of those untranslatable words for which ‘fellowship’ provides one angle, ‘business partnership’ another, and ‘family solidarity’ a third, still leaving us with a sense that more needs to be said for the whole to be grasped.171 That, once more, is what was going on in Paul’s appeal to Philemon. Malina and Neyrey rightly draw attention to other types of fictive family in the ancient world: teachers and disciples, factions and coalitions, work groups, collegia and synagogues, patrons with their clients and, not least, the polis itself, the basic civic unit.172 These provide a network of near parallels, but it is still the case that the fictive family Paul seems to have in mind when he speaks of ‘the household of faith’ and so forth was the people of Israel itself.173 ([Location 11760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11760))

- Within this grouping, hospitality was expected to be offered and received readily, as would be the case within a geographically extended family.174 It is thus absolutely true, as has recently been stressed, that Paul ‘teaches the gospel using ethnic and kinship language to articulate God’s plan for salvation in terms of these identities’, but this does not at all mean that we are wrong to see his message as being for all, Jew as well as gentile.175 And it is precisely within this context that there grows that powerful imperative, springing up right across the Pauline corpus, for agapē: not just a ‘love’ which is drawn instinctively or by emotion towards certain persons, but a practical and outgoing care and concern which displays itself in the concrete realities of money-sharing, project-sharing and life-sharing. One might even designate this as a separate, and significant, item of worldview-praxis.176 ([Location 11776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11776))

- If one were to summarize Paul’s articulation of this central symbol, drawing together the threads of all that we have said so far, we might say six things. First, the gospel message of Jesus the Messiah created a new world with new inhabitants, no longer defined by the specifics of Jewish law, but not seeking as a replacement any of the standard symbols of pagan identity. Second, this new community could sometimes be thought of as the new Temple, sometimes as a human body, in both cases not simply drawing on obvious and available metaphors but making powerful symbolic statements. Third, this new community was to learn to live as a family, with all that this would entail. Fourth, we might suppose that this new community, being itself such a powerful symbol of a radically new worldview, might be regarded as a considerable threat to existing power structures. Fifth, this new symbol was rooted in a monotheism which, while having the recognizable shape of Jewish rather than pagan… ([Location 11784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11784))

Perhaps symbolic or even sociological analysis may yet achieve the revolution in scholarly assumptions that neither the ‘new perspective’ nor the revived ‘apocalyptic’ school, nor even the ‘political Paul’, have so far managed to do, though all might have tumbled to it at any point in recent discussion: Ephesians, long sidelined in western protestant Pauline discussions, turns out to… ([Location 11793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11793))

- This symbol says, as we have noticed several times already, ‘we are the one people of the one God.’ It is a measure of the attention Wayne Meeks paid to the texts that, despite the fact that hardly any New Testament scholars were writing about monotheism when he wrote The First Urban Christians, he recognized that the symbolic vacuum left by the departing symbols of Judaism needed to be filled by just that monotheism which, as we saw in chapter 2, characterized rather fiercely the very strand of Judaism with which Paul had been intimately connected. Paul did indeed so fill it. ‘Christianity,’ writes Meeks, ‘took over the Jewish position completely’: the position, that is, that unlike the varieties of synthetic and syncretistic pagan monotheism (the Stoics, for instance), they worshipped the one true God, and insisted on a correlated ‘exclusive unity of the worshipers’.178 We have seen how this worked out: the emphatic restatement of the (admittedly revised) Shema in 1 Corinthians 8, the invocation of Psalm 24.1 in 1 Corinthians 10, the insistence… ([Location 11799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11799))

- If it is the case that Paul’s worldview was constructed around the central symbol (with its attendant praxis) of the single ‘family’, the one ‘people of God’, the ‘Temple of the living God’, the ‘Messiah’s body’, with none of the expected symbolic praxis either of second-Temple Judaism or ancient paganism to help this central pillar stand up, then we have stumbled upon a reason, perhaps the main reason, for the new place given to what we now call ‘theology’, Paul’s theology in particular. We could put it like this: it is precisely because of the major restructuring of Paul’s symbolic world that ‘theology’ comes to have a different, much larger and more important place in his worldview, and thereafter in the Christian church, than ever it had in either Judaism or paganism. In terms of the present book, it is because of Part II (Paul’s symbolic world) that Part III (Paul’s theology) is absolutely vital. Part III is not, in other words, simply a theologian’s playing with the ideas thrown up by the ‘real’ sociology or history we are doing in Part II, just as (to ward off the opposite objection) the worldview-analysis in Part II is not simply a playing around with sociological categories before getting down to the ‘real thing’ in Part III. The two belong intimately together and support one another. Jewish writers have often commented that ‘theology’, as that word is now understood, is largely a Christian construct, and they are right, for just this reason: that a fresh, reflective understanding of God, the world, the human race, and so on grew and developed to fill the vacuum left by the departing symbols of Judaism. It had to if the new worldview was to have any staying power.

Thinking clearly about God and his purposes was not just an intellectual luxury, an indulgence for long winter evenings. It was part of the solid ground upon which the single, central worldview-symbol would stand firm. The renewed people of God were to be renewed in their minds, learning to think in a way that was given, for the first time ever, the task of sustaining a worldview. To be clear: as we have seen, ‘worldviews’ are things you look through, not at. They are things you take for granted.

- Each of the main things we might wish to say about the role of Jesus in Paul at the level of theology also comes up for consideration at the level of worldview.182 This is not mere duplication. We shall shortly be examining some very specific elements of the symbolic praxis which Paul taught and practised in his churches, some of the rather few things he and his converts did which became, in their turn, loadbearing for the worldview. And the meaning of these elements of symbolic praxis is entirely dependent on the prior symbolic significance, as the character-shaping boundary-marker of the community, of the things Paul believed to be true about Jesus.

- To begin with, he was Israel’s representative Messiah, who summed up the life and story of the people in himself, brought Israel’s history to its appointed if shocking and unexpected climax, and formed in himself the nucleus of the ‘people’ who, called now from all nations, were to inherit the promises and take forward the purposes of the one God. This summary of the meaning of Jesus’ Messiahship in Paul should make it clear that we are not dealing here with an abstract idea, a theological ‘concept’ to be discussed as an intellectual exercise. This is part of the foundation of the community, the Messiah’s ‘body’. The Messiah himself becomes the focus, the sign and the means of unity, the unity in which Jew and gentile will come together as in Galatians, the unity in which slave and free will find a new fellowship as in Philemon. As Messiah, Jesus is the one in whom God’s renewed people are incorporated. Many have seen this point who have never dreamed that it is actually contained, for Paul, within the meaning of Messiahship itself, which, following the fashion of the day, they have denied as a Pauline concept.183 ([Location 11859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11859))

- As Messiah, Jesus was the one in whom God’s faithfulness had come to climactic expression, and who therefore called out faithfulness from his followers. Here is a point of great symbolic significance before it can be explored as a central point of theology: loyalty to Jesus as Messiah, ‘the obedience of faith’ as Paul puts it,184 occupies the place within Paul’s new worldview-construct formerly occupied by the ‘loyalty to God’, or to Torah, or to the holy land, within just that zealous Judaism that we know to have been Paul’s own context. This loyalty, which in its former version would have been a key marker of the genuine, out-and-out committed Jew, was thereby transformed into the identity-anchor within Paul’s renewed worldview. This loyalty (for which the Greek word was pistis) was the thing that demonstrated where God’s true people were to be found within the new creation that had come to birth at Easter. Here, at a symbolic level, we see part of the meaning of ‘justification by pistis’: strange though it will seem to some,… ([Location 11867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11867))

- In particular, Jesus the Messiah was for Paul the eikōn tou theou, the ‘image of God’.185 It is not enough simply to explore this huge notion theologically, in terms of the ‘image’ in Genesis 1 and the reappropriation of that in Paul, or in terms of what this means for traditional ‘christology’, with its discussions of the coming together of ‘divine’ and ‘human’ in Jesus. No: at this point we are concerned with worldview-symbols, and here, as Kavin Rowe has pointed out, we have the beginnings of what we might even call a Christian iconography: the start, and the generative point, for a newly sacral world. The other icons – statues, temples, coins, mosaics – fall away, and for Paul one solitary icon stands in place of them all. Jesus reflects the one God: that is what eikōn tou theou indicates. The fact of Jesus himself, who he was and is, and not least his Messiahship,186 is for Paul the place where, and the means by which, the community of his followers gazes at the one God and, through worship and thanksgiving, is itself transformed into the… ([Location 11877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11877))
- It is hardly controversial to say this, but it needs to be said none the less. The cross itself worked its way into the symbolic imagination of Paul’s successors, and from quite early on there is evidence of its use as a visual symbol. But it could become this because it already possessed a symbolic power within the narrative itself, the symbolic power of being seen as the moment above all when the rescuing purposes of Israel’s God were finally enacted and fulfilled.189 This is its first level of symbolic meaning.

- This symbolic power possessed by the cross needs to be pondered further, into a second level. As Paul himself declared, it was ‘foolishness to Greeks and a scandal to Jews’. More particularly, it flew in the face of all hellenistic wisdom: part of the point of crucifixion was that it completely degraded the sufferer. It denied him any chance of a noble death, a considerable preoccupation among pagans.190 It also, in the normal run of things, denied him a proper burial as well, since the body would be eaten by birds, rats or other carrion and any final remains dumped in a common pit. The complete helplessness of crucifixion stood in sharp contrast to the Stoic, and indeed Socratic, ideal of the person who, perhaps through committing suicide, remained in control of their own fate. Any idea of personal dignity, virtue, worth or meaning was drained away by crucifixion, and designedly so; that is why, long before the Christians gave it a symbolic meaning, it already had one. It was designed to make a statement. It said, whether on the lips of an angry slave-master, a proud emperor or anyone in between, ‘We are in charge here; and this is what happens to people who stand in our way.’ The cross therefore offered a sharp symbolic paradox when the early followers of Jesus claimed that he was the world’s true lord. It was Paul himself who explained this in terms of the revelation both of the faithfulness of Israel’s God and of the new way of being human in which that faithfulness was to be reflected.191 But the second meaning of the cross, as a powerful counter-cultural and then counter-imperial symbol, should not be ignored.

- Third, the cross was indeed a ‘scandal to Jews’; or rather, the idea of a crucified Messiah was a scandal to them. Granted, crucifixion itself was a scandal, a pagan mode of execution that Jews themselves would not normally employ. Granted, too, there is that stray curse in Deuteronomy against one who is hanged on a tree.192 But many, many Jews were crucified, not least by the Romans, during the hundred years either side of the death of Jesus, and though this was no doubt in one sense a scandal, it was more a sorrow, a shame, a disaster. What turned this awfulness into a symbolic as well as theological skandalon was the idea that a crucified man might turn out to be the Messiah. Here we see, in a flash, at a trumpet crash, right into the heart of Paul’s symbolic world. It is as though a sudden bolt of lightning, right outside the window, shone a beacon into a previously dark room. Speaking of himself as a devout Jew, not a ‘gentile sinner’, but as one who has found his new, true identity in Messiah-faith, and speaking with the ‘I’, not… ([Location 11909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11909))

This is an even sharper ‘invasion’ into the first-century zealous Jewish worldview than has been imagined by the purveyors of a would-be ‘apocalyptic’ Paul. The cross, Paul believed, was not simply a strange, outlandish event, in which the one God did something completely new, utterly drastic, world-changing, world-shaking, world-remaking. The cross was actually the God-ordained, utterly shocking and paradoxical climax to the long story, the ‘covenant’ narrative which, as so many have pointed out, could not simply carry on like a broad river moving the divine… ([Location 11920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11920))
- If the cross was central to Paul’s newly generated symbolic world, so of course was the resurrection. He was quite clear (as not all his would-be followers have been) that the cross meant what it meant because Jesus was raised from the dead three days later, and for no other reason. ‘If the Messiah is not raised,’ he wrote to the muddled Corinthians, ‘your faith is futile, and you are still in your sins.’ In other words, without the resurrection, Jesus of Nazareth goes down simply as another disastrous would-be hero.… ([Location 11926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11926))

- With Jesus’ resurrection, however, Paul, like all other early Christians actually known to us, believed that all this had now happened.194 They all took the resurrection of Jesus to be a solid, concrete event, leaving an empty tomb behind it, with Jesus’ body being thoroughly transformed so as to leave behind for ever the possibility of corruption and death. This event, this reality, had an obvious symbolic, worldview-constituting value.195 It was, not least, a fresh marker of time: the new age has dawned, ‘now is the time of salvation.’196 It was, in other words, the sign of a freshly inaugurated eschatology: the end of Israel’s time of desolation, the start of the time of ‘return’, of a new kind of law-fulfilment in line with Deuteronomy 30, the time for the nations to be brought in. Resurrection was much more than an event, though for Paul certainly not less.

- For Paul, the impact of resurrection on behaviour is obvious: the Messiah is raised; if you are in him you are raised as well; so reckon that it’s true and behave accordingly! This point is not new when we meet it in Ephesians and Colossians, as many have tried to insist: it is there, loud and clear, in Romans 6 as well.197 Equally, the point can be put like this: the Messiah has been raised, you belong to him, therefore you will be raised in the future, therefore what you do with your body in the present time matters.198 But it is not just in these matters, things we unhelpfully label as ‘ethical’, that the resurrection functions as a worldview-marker. It is also in the larger issues of the ekklēsia and Israel: ‘what will their acceptance be if not life from the dead?’199 And, out beyond that again, a ‘world’ view indeed: what God did for Jesus at Easter is, mutatis mutandis, what he will do for the whole creation at the end, releasing it from its bondage to decay to enjoy the freedom that comes when God’s children are glorified.200 As I have argued elsewhere, this sharply delineated eschatology draws together and makes far more precise the expectation that some Jews already held. And that fresh, crisp delineation is the direct result of the resurrection of Jesus seen, not as a ‘theological’ statement, though it is that,… ([Location 11943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11943))
- The lordship of Jesus was itself, then, a further symbol, growing directly out of the belief that he was indeed Israel’s Messiah, raised from the dead. It is hard to get the point across to people who have never seen it like this, but we must try none the less: central to some of the key messianic texts in Israel’s scriptures was the affirmation that when Israel’s true King finally arrived, he would be the lord of the whole world, the one who would bring justice to the nations, the one whose kingdom would stretch from one sea to the other, from the River to the ends of the earth.201 The symbolic value of hailing Jesus as lord was much more, then, than the offering of allegiance, the taking on of a new way of life, the commitment to obedience. To the horror of many then and many now, it meant what it said: Jesus had already been installed as the true kosmokrator, world ruler.202 In a world where there was already a World Ruler (by whose subordinates, indeed, this new ‘world ruler’ had been crucified), the announcement of kyrios Christos was bound to have a powerful symbolic value, challenging all other ‘lordships’ of whatever sort, but challenging in particular, we must suppose as a preliminary working hypothesis, the ‘lordship’ of the one whose face leered up from the coins.203 ([Location 11962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=11962))

- Creational monotheists routinely, in the habit of the heart, give thanks to the one God for the creation and their part in it. The Mishnaic tractate Berakoth concludes with a wonderful section insisting that wherever one goes and whatever one witnesses one should find the right point about it for which to give thanks: if someone sees shooting stars, earthquakes, lightnings, thunders and storms, ‘he should say, “Blessed is he whose power and might fill the world” ’, and so on.206 The imperative to give thanks is organically linked to the Shema: because the latter declares ‘thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might’, this means that ‘Man is bound to bless God for the evil even as he blesses God for the good’, and to do so with both ‘inclinations’, with the soul even if it is taken away, with the ‘might’ in the sense of one’s wealth.207 The prayer of Jewish monotheism thus issues in an imperative to thanksgiving, not just where something striking has happened, but quite deliberately and as a habit of life for the whole created order and for one’s own place within it. Messianic (and still of course creational) monotheists might be expected to do the same, only with Jesus and his specific achievements built in. This is not just a matter of (as it were) voluntary personal piety, but a key worldview-marker, an indication in the realm of praxis of what we have just been examining, the theological grounding of the central pillar of the emerging early Christian worldview.

- No surprises, then: Paul fits into this pattern like a foot into a well-made shoe. Apart from Galatians (where he is in such a tearing hurry, and so appalled at what he has heard, that he either forgets to thank God for the Galatians or simply can’t think of anything to thank God for in relation to them just at this moment) his letters always begin with thanks. Thanks for the faith of the Roman ekklēsia, known throughout the world; for the great enrichment that has been poured out in Corinth, so that the ekklēsia there lacks nothing in terms of speech, knowledge and spiritual gifts (Paul might have been glad if they had a few less, to keep them humble, but that will come later); thanks, in the agonizing second letter, that God ‘consoles us in all our affliction’; thanks for the partnership of the Philippians, the faith, love and hope of the Colossians and the Thessalonians, the love and faith of Philemon.208 Once again, Ephesians outdoes them all with a majestic opening Berakah, a prayer of thanksgiving which tells the whole story of God’s plan from before the foundation of the world, through the great redeeming events of the gospel, and right up to the present time, with a sense, like a tourist map, of an arrow at the end which says, ‘You are here.’209 ([Location 12001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12001))

- And be thankful. The robust monotheism of this ought not to be missed. No doubt the Colossians had much to complain of (and would soon have more: an earthquake in the early 60s devastated much of the area, and it is assumed that Colosse suffered along with Laodicea and other local towns, resulting in the site’s abandonment; but, at least according to the Mishnah, one should be prepared to give thanks to God even for an earthquake).211 And, once again, Ephesians catches the messianically reshaped monotheistic thanksgiving exactly: ‘giving thanks to God the father at all times and for everything in the name of our lord Jesus the Messiah.’212 Both with monotheism and the unveiling of the Messiah they had everything to be thankful for, not through some vague escapist piety but through the robust belief in the creator God who had finally implemented his plan for the creation. Thanksgiving demonstrates Jewish-style monotheism, which again and again for Paul means messianic monotheism; and monotheism of just this sort is the ground on which the worldview-pillar stands. Thanksgiving isn’t just a way of being a bit less grumpy and a bit more cheerful. It is a habit of the heart which indicates the nature and particular shape of the worldview. It is closely associated with joy, which for Paul is one of the primary signs of the spirit’s work.213 ([Location 12019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12019))

- First, insofar as we can track Paul’s experience and language, we can see that it belongs fairly and squarely in the centre of the Jewish religious world of his day. For him to speak of ‘visions and revelations’, of a particular ‘revelation’ (apokalypsis!) which had determined the course of his life and work, and the central core of his ‘gospel’, and of a hidden wisdom on the one hand and hidden glory on the other, was to deal in the (fairly) common coin of ancient Jewish devotion and the quest for a fresh pathway into God’s future. It was one element of what the praxis of Jewish-style monotheism looked like at the time.220 ([Location 12062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12062))

- Third, therefore, we should expect, and do in fact find, that the two key areas of which the rabbis spoke when they described the classic streams of mysticism – penetration of the secrets of creation and cosmology on the one hand, and gazing on the vision of God enthroned on his chariot (as in Ezekiel 1) on the other – both find fresh and messianic expression in Paul. Colossians offers perhaps the best example, with its magnificent poem allotting Jesus the Messiah the place where we might have expected to find the Wisdom through whom the world was made, and also describing him as the one ‘in whom all the fullness of deity dwells bodily’. This is Jewish mysticism, practised as a central part of his worldview-praxis, but it has been redefined and reshaped around Jesus the Messiah.221 And that redefinition has not left the praxis of mystical prayer itself unaltered. The Jesus whom Paul saw on the road to Damascus, the Jesus who was now ‘unveiled’ in the gospel as the key to God’s faithfulness – this Jesus had, as it were, reversed the normal direction of ‘mystical’ travel. Instead of the mystic ‘ascending’ towards either the throne of God or the place where cosmic secrets might be revealed, Jesus had himself ‘descended’, had come down, come near, transforming the practice of mysticism itself into a life of prayer in the spirit in which all could partake.222 ([Location 12071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12071))

This does not mean that one imagines it as a kind of analogous cousin to the various ritual washings and bathing-pools of which we know, or even to the one-off baptism of proselytes we find in contemporary Jewish sources, though they may remain as echoes in the minds of some.239 Rather, I suggest that baptism, as part of the community-defining symbolic system of early Christianity in general and Pauline praxis in particular, is to be seen as rooted in the community-defining symbols of Judaism: which means, in particular, the exodus on the one hand and circumcision on the other – both of them, of course, seen by Paul as pointing forward to the dying and rising of the Messiah.

- His own example (1 Corinthians 9) has made that point dramatically: what matters is not one’s rights, but the gospel of Jesus the crucified and risen Messiah. Now and only now, having laid those very positive foundations, will he move into a more negative mode, warning against the real dangers which are ‘out there’ in the pagan world from which most of the converted Corinthians had come. And the way he does it is to go back to the founding events of the family: ‘our fathers’ experienced the exodus! The our is positively breathtaking, unless one had fully grasped already the extent to which Paul sees the Messiah’s people as the heirs of Abraham. Here is the family story, he says, into which you have been incorporated. It began, precisely, with baptism: the cloud and the sea, the divine presence leading them safely through the water while the pursuing Egyptians were drowned.

- The point Paul is making here is remarkable in itself, and is as we have seen indicative of the way Paul is arguing throughout the letter, and hence of the problems he believes himself to be facing.242 All the Israelites went through the water, with God’s cloud-shielded presence leading the way. But God was not pleased: their ‘baptism’ did not mean that they were then immune from entanglement in practices which denied their new status as God’s rescued people. Pagan idolatry, in the form of Moabite temptations, surrounded them; many succumbed.243 In other words, though baptism really does define the community of God’s people as the place of God’s presence, those who come in by that door must not risk the same fate as their ancestors. Baptism does not afford entry into a magically shielded space where one is automatically immune from danger. On the contrary. That is why, he says, though you are free to eat anything bought in the market, you really should not go into the idol temples themselves. That way danger lies: specifically, the danger of appearing to share fellowship (koinōnia) with ‘demons’, daimonia, at the same time as, in the eucharist, you are sharing koinōnia with the Messiah.244 That koinōnia is marked out by baptism. Those who enter it must continue to be marked by it. That is why, from the very beginning, baptism and eucharist are inseparable.

- Already we see something enormously important in terms of many subsequent debates, which have (in my view) gone off in the wrong direction by focusing at once on the relation between the rite of baptism and the individual who is baptized. Baptism is a community-marking symbol, which the individual then receives, not first and foremost as a statement about him- or herself, but as a statement which says, ‘This is who we are.’ This does not exactly defuse all the anxieties of troubled Protestants when contemplating a physical event with supposed spiritual consequences, but it may suggest that the normal way of looking at ‘the problem’ is, at least, seeing things through the wrong end of the telescope.… ([Location 12208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12208))

- This is how it works in Romans itself: Romans 4 tells the story of Abraham; after the wider perspective of Romans 5, where Paul surveys the entire sweep of God’s purposes from the highest possible point, we resume the story in Romans 6 by coming through the water, by which the slaves are freed, arriving at Sinai in Romans 7 and grappling with the question of Torah, constructing the tabernacle in 8.9–11 (the ‘indwelling’ spirit),246 continuing the journey through the wilderness in 8.12–16 and glimpsing the promised ‘inheritance’ in 8.17–30. This sequence, I suggest, cannot be accidental. It is part of the conscious and deliberate structuring which Paul has given to this, one of his most obviously carefully composed passages. The deep meaning of telling the story this way, within the letter as a whole, is to make the point as clearly as possible, the point which is stated in a nutshell at the end of chapter 4: the Messiah and his people are the people promised to Abraham, the true-exodus people on their way to inheriting the true ‘promised land’, i.e. the whole renewed creation. This, indeed, is what precipitates the outburst of grief at the start of chapter ([Location 12219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12219))
- the meaning of baptism in Romans 6.2–11 is this: you are the new-exodus people, the people defined by the death and resurrection of the Messiah. If you have been baptized, you belong to the people thus defined, and you must therefore draw the proper conclusions: you, too, have died and been raised. ‘You, too, must calculate yourselves as being dead to sin, and alive to God in the Messiah, Jesus’ (6.11). You must work out the fact that you have been brought out of slavery, and stand now as free people on the way to your inheritance. We note, once again, against the run of much scholarship which has played off Romans 6 against Colossians and Ephesians, that though of course the bodily resurrection remains in the future (8.10–11), the whole point of 6.11 is that ‘reckoning’ oneself to be dead to sin and alive to God is not a fresh act on the part of the baptized by which they become something which before they were not. ‘Reckoning’ simply means ‘calculating’, working out what is in fact the case. And what is the case is that they are not in some strange intermediate state. They have died and they are ‘alive to God’.247 Baptism marks out this community as the new-exodus people, the people who must therefore live in the appropriate way. As in 1 Corinthians 10, one might almost say that Paul appeals for a genuine, thought-out faith on the basis of baptism: now you are baptized, figure out what it means! The true statement that baptism makes is a statement about the baptized community in Christ, with the truth of the dying and rising of the particular individual who is baptized on this or that occasion being a function of that larger reality. The challenge to particular individuals is always then to make real for themselves that which their membership in this community would indicate.

- It is this sense of a sequence that dominates Galatians 3.23–9. There is a three-stage sequence, beginning with ‘before faith came, we were under the law’, continuing with ‘the arrival of faith’ and ending with ‘no longer under the law’. This new state is then explained in a typically Pauline exposition: (i) an initial statement (verse 26), (ii) a further explanation for this initial statement (verse 27), (iii) a conclusion to be drawn from that explanation (verse 28) and (iv) the final QED of the argument in verse 29: (i) For you are all children of God, through faith, in the Messiah, Jesus (26). (ii) You see, every one of you who has been baptized into the Messiah has put on the Messiah (27). (iii) There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no ‘male and female’; you are all one in the Messiah, Jesus (28).

- Here is how the sequence works. The initial statement, itself explaining the claim of verse 25 (no longer under the paidagōgos): ‘For you are all children of God, through faith, in the Messiah, Jesus.’ All children of God: that is the main thing, with Messiah-faithfulness the means by which this is accomplished and marked out. ‘Children of God’ echoes the exodus-promise: Israel is my son, my firstborn,250 so we ought not to be surprised at the reference to baptism which follows immediately, with the emphasis still falling on the implicit ‘all’: ‘You see, every one of you who has been baptised into the Messiah has put on the Messiah’ (27). This then leads to the two-stage conclusion, in 28–9: ‘There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no “male and female”; you are all one in the Messiah, Jesus.

The emphasis in this passage on circumcision and the law as having nothing more to say to them is what convinced me twenty-five years ago, and convinces me still, that the subtle polemic of chapter 2 is aimed, primarily at least, at the possibility that the young church might be lured away into the synagogue, whether by people like the Galatian ‘agitators’ or others not totally dissimilar… ([Location 12272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12272))

One natural Pauline response might be, ‘the “circumcision of the heart” spoken of in Deuteronomy 30 and again in Jeremiah.’252 That may be in Paul’s mind as well, but what he says here is In him, indeed, you were circumcised with a special, new type of circumcision. It isn’t something that human hands can do. It is the Messiah’s version of circumcision, and it happens when you put off the ‘body of flesh’; when you’re buried with… ([Location 12277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12277))

- baptism defines the community of the Messiah’s people in the way that circumcision defined the people of Israel according to the flesh. Identity ‘according to the flesh’ is set aside: you and your community are no longer defined by who your parents were. (That, perhaps, is why he has said ‘the body of flesh’ here, rather than ‘the body of sin’ in Romans 6.6, where the relationship of the baptized to ‘sin’ is precisely what is at issue.) The ‘Messiah’s version of circumcision’ is literally ‘the circumcision of the Messiah’, but this is not, of course, a reference to Jesus’ own circumcision.255 It is a way of saying, ‘This is the Messiah’s own new mode of circumcision.’ Once again, the primary point is about the definition of the community, only secondarily the effect on the individual.

- We return, finally, to 1 Corinthians. The flurry of references to baptism in the first chapter has the same overall thrust that we have seen elsewhere. Paul’s main concern is to offer a preliminary challenge to the factionalism that has emerged in Corinth, and he does so by appealing, again merely preliminarily, to baptism itself. The community to which you belong, he is saying, is defined by baptism, and baptism is defined as entry into the Messiah’s people. Being baptized ‘into the name of’ someone – not my name, he says twice, but by implication into the name of the Messiah – is to enter the community defined as the people who live in the presence of the one thus ‘named’.256 And the point of Paul’s final emphatic statement in verse 17 (‘the Messiah didn’t send me to baptize but to preach the gospel’) is not, despite the natural anti-sacramental reading in much Protestantism, a… ([Location 12294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12294))

- This reading of chapter 1, and our previous account of chapter 10, points naturally to the climactic statement at the start of the ‘Messiah’s body’ passage in chapter 12. The key passage, verses 12 and 13, is carefully positioned between the chapter’s opening statement (12.1–3) and its initial development (verses 4–11), on the one hand, and the full-dress picture of the ‘body’ in its functioning (verses 14–26) with the conclusion (verses 27–31), on the other. The chapter has something of an ABCBʹAʹ shape, with this statement in 12.12–13 as the central point around which everything else revolves:258 A12.1–312.27–31Aʹ   B12.4–1112.14–26Bʹ   12.12–13C  If ‘we’ were all ‘baptized into the name of the Messiah’, as by implication in chapter 1, we are likewise baptized into his ‘body’.

- The primary point of baptism, then, is not so much ‘that it does something to the individual’, though it does, but that it defines the community of the baptized as the Messiah’s people. Those who submit to baptism are thereby challenged to learn the family codes, the house rules, the way of life that this community is committed to precisely because it is the family of the Messiah, the crucified and risen one. Paul here echoes what has obviously become for him a regular ‘way of putting it’, seen already in Galatians 3.28 (the reference here in 1 Corinthians 12 to Jews and Greeks, slave and free, is not relevant to anything in the present passage, but merely reminds the Corinthians of the united nature of the family defined by baptism-into-Messiah).260 That is where the emphasis falls, taking us back to our primary point in this whole section: Paul’s world of… ([Location 12321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12321))

- We may simply note, in conclusion, that if we were attempting to sum up what we have said about baptism in relation to the wider united community, and its rootedness in the one God and the one lord, and the need which Paul articulates to make this unity a reality in the actual personal lives of the community’s members, we could do worse than quote again from Ephesians: 2Bear with one another in love; be humble, meek and patient in every way with one another. 3Make every effort to guard the unity that the spirit gives, with your lives bound together in peace. 4There is one body and one spirit; you were, after all, called to one hope which goes with your call. 5There is one lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and father of all, who is over all, through all and in all.263 ([Location 12334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12334))
- So, to sum up: baptism in the worldview of Paul’s communities, and within his own mindset, emerges not from pagan mystery religions but from the deep roots of Jewish covenantal story and covenantal symbolism. It is differentiated from the latter precisely because of the crucifixion and resurrection of Israel’s Messiah and the effect that that has had in generating the Messiah’s people as a worldwide family. The passage in Colossians appears to form something of a mid-point between Galatians and Romans. In Galatians, the emphasis is on the renewed multi-ethnic family; in Romans (as in 1 Corinthians 10, for that matter), it is on the fact that the family leaves behind the realm of sin; in Colossians, there is a bit of both, and in 1 Corinthians 1 and 12 a reaffirmation of unity when faced by a different kind of threat. But the point for our present purposes is that baptism is clearly a key ritual (in the sense noted above) which serves to mark out this people in this way as part of this single and united family, grounded in the messianic monotheism we have already described.

- The same, more briefly, can and must be said about Paul’s vision of the Lord’s Supper.264 Sadly, we do not possess two or three different angles of vision at this point, as we do with baptism. We have the point of view of Paul writing to the Corinthians, and that is all. But it is enough to be going on with. As with baptism, the partial parallels and slippery semi-analogies with pagan practices are interesting, but insufficient to explain the meal as Paul envisages it. With memories of 1 Corinthians 5.7 not far away (‘our Passover lamb – the Messiah, I mean – has already been sacrificed’), it is pointless to deny what is already clear from the opening of chapter 10, namely that Paul is thinking of the exodus narrative. When, therefore, we agree that the Lord’s Supper for Paul ‘reenacts and derives its significance from the story of Christ’s self-giving death and (implicitly) his resurrection’, and that ‘the central story of the Christian myth is encapsulated in this ritual practice,’265 we want to add, quite strongly, that we are talking about this central Christian story seen as the culmination, climax and paradoxical meaning of the ancient Jewish story for which Passover and exodus were the prototype. It is, of course, difficult to prove exact correlations between the traditions we find in 1 Corinthians 10.15–17 and 11.23–6 and those we find in the multiple and complex synoptic tradition.266 But there we run the risk, as often in the over-microscopic world of New Testament studies, of trying to track individual insects that inhabit the bark of this or that tree when we should be looking at the forest as a whole.

- Paul does say, after all, ‘consider Israel according to the flesh’ (1 Corinthians 10.18, translating kata sarka literally). Why does he put it like this? The most obvious reason (again, sometimes held at bay for understandable but essentially non-historical reasons) is that he is implicitly contrasting ‘Israel kata sarka’ with the community that now regards the exodus generation as ‘our fathers’ (10.1). He sees a reasonably straightfoward equation. ‘Israel according to the flesh’ reckons that partaking of a sacrifice in the Temple means sharing in the very life of Israel’s God (this, I take it, is what is meant by the apparent euphemism ‘partners in the altar’, koinōnoi tou thysiastēriou268). So, too, pagans reckon that when they share in a sacrifice they are sharing the life of the divinity in whose temple they are eating. In more or less the same way – no doubt there are many mutanda at this point, but Paul is not here concerned with them – those who share in the bread and the wine at the Lord’s Supper really are sharing in the body and blood of the Messiah. Once again the unity of the people is part of the point: ‘we, though many, are one body, because we all share in the one loaf’ (10.17). That is what will concern him more in the next chapter, facing as we saw the unpleasant and demeaning emergence of social divisions at the meal itself. But here the point is simply that this meal marks out its participants as Messiah-people (and hence as crucified-and-risen people); as (true-)exodus people; as the people he will describe in 10.32 as ‘God’s ekklēsia’, contrasted both with Jews and with Greeks. And the more the story of the exodus resonates in the background, the more we are inclined to see, as well as in the implicit parallel with pagan meals, the great Pauline truth that sharing in this meal means participating in the very life of the one… ([Location 12370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12370))

- First, it is practical. When he tells the Thessalonians that they must love one another even more than they are already doing, this has nothing much to do with the stirring up of emotions. It is about what used to be called ‘charity’: the putting of one’s assets at the disposal of those, particularly within the Christian family, who at present need them more than one does oneself. ‘Love’ is thus very nearly the same thing as what Paul means by ‘grace’ in that tense and tightly argued little fund-raising section we call 2 Corinthians 8—9. ‘Love’ is what, according to Acts, the early Jerusalem church practised; it meant a sharing of goods such as one might expect within a family. And this was for the obvious reason that they were now a ‘family’ in quite a new way. Hence, too, the need to look after the vulnerable, particularly widows. Thus, if agapē approximates to some meanings of ‘grace’, it also comes close to, and partially overlaps with, that other great Pauline word koinōnia, ‘partnership’. Love, for… ([Location 12390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12390))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Second, for Paul ‘love’ is about unity. Indeed, it is both the motive for that unity and the thing that will make it work. It is the sign of life in a community; when Epaphras returns to Paul with news of a new community of believers in Colossae, the key thing he announces to the imprisoned apostle is ‘their love in the spirit’.271 We have already noted Paul’s breathtaking exhortation in Philippians 2.1–4, urging the little community to be in full accord and of one mind. This is costly and difficult, which is one reason why he follows the command with the equally breathtaking narrative of the Messiah’s own self-abnegation, suffering and death – and vindication. The same point is made at more length in Ephesians 4.1–16, where ‘love’ is noted as part of the quality of mind required in verse 2 and then again as the central characteristic of the whole united church in verse 16; ‘love’ is (surely not accidentally) the final word of the paragraph. This is the place to note, as well, not only the matchless beauty of the poem we know as 1 Corinthians 13, but also its rhetorical placing between chapters 12 and 14. The multi-faceted charismatic church, learning to live as a single body, forms the main topic of chapter 12; its… ([Location 12399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12399))

But, as any gardener will know, just because the tree is alive and blossoming, it doesn’t mean there is no work to do. The fact that the list of ‘fruit of the spirit’ ends with ‘self-control’ gives the game away: this is no romantic dream of a ‘spontaneous’ goodness. Love, joy, peace and the rest are all things which, though indeed growing from the work of the spirit within, require careful tending, protecting,… ([Location 12411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12411))
- The fourth and in some ways most obvious feature of Paul’s vision of agapē is that it is rooted in, and sustained by, Jesus himself. ‘The son of God loved me and gave himself for me’: this is not an extraneous and merely pious remark, but goes to the heart of what, in much later theological parlance, would be called both the extra nos of salvation (what God does outside us and apart from us) and also the intra nos (what God does within the believer). About these we shall speak more in due course. ‘The Messiah’s love makes us press on,’ Paul declares, writing of the trials and testings of the apostolic vocation, and spelling out that ‘love’ in terms both of the Messiah’s self-giving to death and of the apostolic praxis, the ‘ministry of reconciliation’.275 The Messiah is both the model and the means of love.276 It is at this point that we may glimpse what Paul means when he speaks of agapē as the… ([Location 12418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12418))

- By the time he has reached chapter 11, however, the tone has changed again (whether because this is from a different letter or because his spirits have revived, as he says in 7.6–16, we need not here enquire). Now we see that the Corinthians’ request that he supply ‘letters of recommendation’ (3.1) or, in today’s term, an updated curriculum vitae listing all his achievements, has given him an opportunity to tease them mercilessly while still making the utterly serious point that ‘weakness’, suffering, shame and ultimately death itself are badges precisely of the newly redefined, messianic/monotheistic family. He offers an inverted cursus honorum, the mirror-image of the kind of ‘boasting’ which we associate with the Roman world, not least an achievement-list such as Augustus’s Res Gestae: 23Are they servants of the Messiah? – I’m talking like a raving madman – I’m a better one. I’ve worked harder, been in prison more often, been beaten more times than I can count, and I’ve often been close to death. 24Five times I’ve had the Jewish beating, forty lashes less one. 25Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; I was adrift in the sea for a night and a day. 26I’ve been constantly travelling, facing dangers from rivers, dangers from brigands, dangers from my own people, dangers from foreigners, dangers in the town, dangers in the countryside, dangers at sea, dangers from false believers. 27I’ve toiled and laboured, I’ve burnt the candle at both ends, I’ve been hungry and thirsty, I’ve often gone without food altogether, I’ve been cold and naked. 28Quite apart from all that, I have this daily pressure on me, my care for all the churches. 29Who is weak and I’m not weak? Who is offended without me burning with shame? 30If I must boast, I will boast of my weaknesses. 31The God and father of the lord Jesus, who is blessed for ever, knows that I’m not lying: 32in Damascus, King Aretas, the local ruler, was guarding the city of Damascus so that he could capture me, 33but I was let down in a basket through a window and over the wall, and I escaped his clutches.284 And then, one last time: … so that I wouldn’t become too exalted, a thorn was given to me in my flesh, a messenger from the satan, to keep stabbing away at me. I prayed to the lord three times about this, asking that it would be taken away from me, 9and this is what he said to me: ‘My grace is enough for you; my power comes to perfection in weakness.’ So I will be all the more pleased to boast of my weaknesses, so that the Messiah’s power may rest upon me. 10So I’m delighted when I’m weak, insulted, in difficulties, persecuted and facing disasters, for the Messiah’s sake.

- And the underlying point, with this double-effect rhetoric rubbing it in, is this: in contrast to the Corinthians’ apparent expectations that he present himself as a fine, upstanding, noble, heroic figure, Paul insists as a matter of symbolic praxis that that is entirely the wrong way round. Exactly in line with the redefinition of power and authority in Mark 10.25–45, Paul believes that apostolic life consists not only in telling people about the dying and rising of the Messiah, but also in going through the process oneself.

- When we try to locate this strong Pauline theme within its historical, cultural or theological contexts, we find that what Paul has just done to the Corinthians spells the death of any attempt to make him a Stoic just like the Stoics, or indeed any kind of ancient philosopher of any pretension. (Even Socrates, willingly drinking the hemlock, didn’t go on about it in the way Paul does, or interpret it in the same way. Paul was aware of the strong emotions of friendship and loss, and would not, I think, have told his friends to stop grieving in the way that Socrates did.286) As various writers have observed, the popular philosophers aimed at a kind of self-sufficiency, either through getting rid of everything… ([Location 12498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12498))

- There was a battle on, and loyalty to God and Torah would probably mean suffering, at least for some and at least for some of the time. Evil powers were at work, after all, operating through pagans outside Israel and renegades inside, and loyalty would inevitably mean being caught in between. So the horrible sufferings of the Maccabean martyrs and many others were seen as symbols, symbols of the life of a people called to be God’s people in the midst of a wicked world, living with a set of stories, contained within one long Story, all of which said that God’s people would indeed pass through slavery, torment, subjugation, humiliation and much besides, but that they would be vindicated at the end. And, as we have seen elsewhere, some Jewish writers from quite early on, but more as we come towards the first century, told this story in terms of a crescendo of evil, an increase in hostility towards God’s people, a climax of suffering, which would be like the labour pains from which a child would be born. Some have given this notion of a historical sequence, reaching such a high point of suffering, the label ‘the messianic woes’. I argued in a previous volume, following Albert Schweitzer, that Jesus himself was aware of this tradition and made it part of his own vocational understanding as he announced God’s kingdom and discerned his own strange, dark role within it.288 And the point we need to make… ([Location 12507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12507))

- He could even speak of his own suffering in terms that imply, somehow, that he would take the heavy end of the load so that the young churches could escape with the light end. There is more than a hint of that in 2 Corinthians 4.12, quoted above. But it comes out especially strongly in a dense and surprising sentence in Colossians: Right now I’m having a celebration – a celebration of my sufferings, which are for your benefit! And I’m steadily completing, in my own flesh, what remains of the Messiah’s afflictions on behalf of his body, which is the church.289 The Messiah’s afflictions: perhaps here we have just that notion of the ‘messianic woes’, a fixed amount of suffering to be undergone before the terror would be over. Certainly Paul has no thought here (as anxious interpreters have sometimes worried) that he was in some sense adding to the atoning significance of the Messiah’s death.

- There may be quite a literal meaning to this. As long as the officials are concentrating on keeping Paul in prison and making life hard for him, they may not worry too much about a little group of his followers.290 Paul is taking the heat so that they will not need to. And somehow this suffering, too, is part of the Messiah’s sufferings. Not at all that Jesus himself continues, in that sense, to suffer: the Messiah, being raised from the dead, will never die again, and death has no dominion over him.291 But here we find, as so often, ‘the Messiah’ as ‘the one who sums up his people in himself’, the one ‘in whom’ his people find their identity. And here we find too, just as in 2 Corinthians 4, the notion that suffering is, for Paul, a major worldview-marker, precisely because the community thus demarcated is the community that belongs to this Messiah, the crucified one. Their sufferings are his sufferings. That is part of the way they are to be known.

- But one remark by way of conclusion. As we saw in looking at the central worldview-symbol, the ekklēsia itself, one of the ways in which Paul describes it is as the Temple. And this may indicate quite a different mode of ‘mission’. Paul seems to have believed that the individual churches, little groups of baptized believers coming together in communities of worship and love, dotted here and there around the north-east Mediterranean world, were each a living Temple in which the creator God, the God who had dwelt in the Temple in Jerusalem, was now dwelling. They were, in other words, the advance signs of that time when the whole world would be filled with the divine glory. Each lamp that was lit, in Colosse or Philippi or wherever, was a point of light, of divine presence, as a sign of the dawn that would come when the whole world would be so illuminated. That, I think, is part of what he means in Colossians 1.27: the Messiah in you, the hope of glory.301 The indwelling Messiah, living in his Temple in Colosse, was the sign that ‘the hope of glory’ was starting to come true – the hope, that is, that YHWH would return in glory to his Temple, and that he would thereby fill the whole earth with his knowledge and glory, with his justice, peace and joy. Paul sees each ekklēsia as a sign of that future reality. To that extent, and in that sense, we can already say that ‘mission’ was indeed part of the symbolic reality (together with unity and holiness) by which Paul understood his communities to be defined.302 The word ‘mission’ is used in many different ways today; we must be sure to understand it in the full sense which Paul would have understood. This will be part of the task of chapter 16 below. ([Location 12575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12575))

- Like some of his other key technical terms (‘son of God’, for instance), the actual word ‘image’ does not occur frequently in Paul’s writings, but when it does it carries a lot of freight. One use in particular draws to our attention a passage from which alone we should deduce that Paul did indeed think of the Messiah’s people as called to be, either now or eventually, the real article, the genuine humanity planned all along by the creator: That’s what it’s like with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown decaying, and raised undecaying. 43It is sown in shame, and raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, and raised in power. 44It is sown as the embodiment of ordinary nature, and raised as the embodiment of the spirit. If ordinary nature has its embodiment, then the spirit too has its embodiment. 45That’s what it means when the Bible says, ‘The first man, Adam, became a living natural being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46But you don’t get the spirit-animated body first; you get the nature-animated one, and you get the spirit-animated one later. 47The first man is from the ground, and is made of earth; the second man is from heaven. 48Earthly people are like the man of earth; heavenly people are like the man from heaven. 49We have borne the image of the man made of earth; we shall also bear the image of the man from heaven.305 ([Location 12597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12597))

- I quote the whole passage, because the key verse for our present purposes, verse 49, is the climax of that sustained build-up, the ultimate point of the entire argument. With that verse, Paul has finished the main thrust of the greatest chapter in this, arguably his second greatest letter (certainly his second longest). It is as though he has kept the word ‘image’ in reserve all the way through, but, as close study of the entire chapter indicates, Genesis 1, 2 and 3 have been in his mind all along, and part of the whole point has been the restoration of the original imagebearing vocation of Genesis 1.26–8. Now at last it comes, almost as a QED, referring right back to the original Adam/Messiah contrast in verses 21–2 (‘since it was through a human that death arrived, it is through a human that the resurrection from the dead has arrived; all die in Adam, you see, and all will be made alive in the Messiah’) and forming a carefully planned ‘circle’ with that opening.306 ([Location 12609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12609))
- The point for our purposes is this: all humankind is marked with the ‘image’ of Adam, as in Genesis 5.3, where Adam becomes the father of Seth, ‘in his likeness, according to his image’, a deliberate echo of Genesis 1.28 but now impressing on the reader the fact that Adam is passing on his ‘likeness and image’.307 We have been Adam-image people; now we are to be Messiah-image people, reflecting the image of the one who is himself the reflection of the invisible God, as in 2 Corinthians 4.4.308 Though this obviously refers here to the final state of the resurrected body, part of the point of 1 Corinthians as a whole is to insist that followers of the Messiah should live already in the present in the light of what they will turn out to be in the future. That (for instance) is how the inaugurated eschatology of chapter 13 functions: faith, hope and particularly love will last into God’s future, so we must work on them here and now. That, too, is how the clear and sharp ethic of chapter 6 functions.

- The same point emerges in the large, and even more carefully constructed, argument of Romans 5—8. Once again there is a long, slow circle involved, from the dense opening statements of the theme in chapter 5 through to the final triumphant statements towards the end of chapter 8. All we need for our present purpose is to note the links and the theological resonances they set up. In 5.2 Paul’s opening statement of where his argument has now reached concludes by saying that ‘we rejoice in the hope of God’s glory’, and the reader recalls that this ‘glory’ is what was lost, according to 3.23, through sin. A reference to Adam in 3.23 is now more or less universally assumed by commentators, many referring back also to the echoes of Genesis 3 in 1.18–25.310 All this implicit material about the glory of humankind being lost and now being restored prepares us for the dense and cryptic, but central and vital, statement of the Adam/Messiah theme in 5.12–21, which turns out to be the ground plan (however quickly and allusively sketched) for the narrative, and its various themes, which Paul then offers in 6.1—8.30. It is often noticed that towards the end of chapter 8 Paul returns to the themes he stated at the start of chapter 5, and among those themes we should note particularly… ([Location 12627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12627))

- The idea of the Messiah-people as God’s ‘image’ thus appears as a future hope which is to be anticipated, by the spirit, in the present. ‘Being conformed to the image of the son’, as in Romans 8.29, summarizes importantly both the present vocation of suffering, as in 8.17, and the promise of ‘glory’, the theme which binds together 8.17 with 8.18, 8.21 and 8.30. As we have seen in both 1 Corinthians and Romans, part of the whole point of Paul’s message (and part of the reason for its complexity) is the urgent imperative to anticipate in the present, through the presence, power and personality of the Spirit, that which we are promised in the future. And this, in 2 Corinthians, includes also the vocation to be renewed and restored imagebearers: All of us, without any veil on our faces, gaze at the glory of the lord as in a mirror, and so are being changed into the same image, from glory to glory, just as you would expect from the lord, the spirit … We don’t proclaim ourselves, you see, but Jesus the Messiah as lord, and ourselves as your servants because of Jesus; because the God who said ‘let light shine out of darkness’ has shone in our hearts, to produce the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus the Messiah.313 ([Location 12649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12649))

- Jesus the Messiah is himself the true ‘image’, and the glory of God is reflected through him ‘in our hearts’. But what is thus true in the heart is true, by the spirit, on the unveiled face of believers: that is the extraordinary point Paul is emphasizing at the end of chapter 3. It may not look like it to the naked eye. That is why Paul goes on at once in 4.7 to speak of ‘having the treasure in earthen vessels’. But this is part of the challenge of the gospel, that Messiah-people should learn to see the glory of the lord in one another.314 ([Location 12659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12659))

But more particularly here he speaks of being ‘clothed’ with the new humanity, in other words, with the Messiah himself, just as in the baptismal passage in Galatians 3.27 and elsewhere.315 This clothing, this being ‘renewed in the image of the creator’, is not something for which one must simply wait until the resurrection.

- Bearing the image of God, through the agency of the Messiah, thus emerges as one of the foundation themes of Paul’s vision for what we may call ‘new humanity’. And this is what he tries to inculcate at the heart of the praxis of his communities. It is not just a neat trick of speech, a clever rhetorical way of working round to some ‘rules’ he wants to impose for other reasons. It is part of the worldview. We should not miss the powerful theological significance of this, which is also part of the worldview-symbolism: in a worldview where pagan images no longer have any meaning, Paul is not leaving the cosmos without images to mediate the presence of the one true God. On the contrary. The world, the cosmos, is already presented with the one true Image, the Messiah himself; and the symbolic praxis of the Messiah’s people is thus grounded, by the spirit, in the vocation to be imagebearers, to be the means of participating in and reflecting the true divine life into a world whose iconography had been giving off either a radically distorted vision or a downright lying one.316 To put it in shorthand: in a world whose icons had been reflecting non-gods, the renewed iconography which informs and sustains the material symbolic universe of the Messiah-people begins with renewed human behaviour.317 And this dovetails exactly with the ‘new Temple’ vision we have already explored. The spirit’s indwelling enables the Messiah’s people to be a dispersed Temple-people, the living presence of the one God launching the project of bringing the true divine life into the whole cosmos.

- This sets the context for the main body of material in which Paul sees the symbolic praxis of the Messiah-people in terms of their actual behaviour – looking at this not in terms of ‘ethics’ seen through the lens of either deontology or indeed teleology, but rather in terms of worldview-praxis. These behaviour-patterns are to become the ‘practical consciousness’, the ‘social autopilot’, of the communities that belong to the one family of the one God.318 As Clifford Geertz pointed out rather tartly a generation ago, (what he called) ‘world view’ and (what he called) ‘ethos’ – ontology and cosmology on the one hand, aesthetics and morality on the other, or even ‘fact and value’ – may be separable in thought but they never are in reality. And what he calls ‘sacred symbols’ are the means by which they are related. ‘The number of such synthesizing symbols,’ he goes on, is limited in any culture, and though in theory we might think that a people could construct a wholly autonomous value system independent of any metaphysical referent, an ethics without ontology, we do not in fact seem to have found such a people. The tendency to synthesize world view and ethos at some level, if not logically necessary, is at least empirically coercive; if it is not philosophically justified, it is at least pragmatically universal.319 ([Location 12691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12691))

He assumes that he can and should address his communities as hagioi, ‘saints’ – even the muddled and misguided Corinthians.320 This, as Horrell rightly stresses, is a basically Jewish identity, marking a distinction between Messiah-people and the wider world.321 That holds true at point after point elsewhere as well.

- the idea of Paul’s communities as Jewish-style hagioi does create an assumption about where to place Paul’s vision of the community within the wider history-of-religions (or indeed history-of-philosophies) paradigm. As Horrell observes, work on Paul’s worldview in relation to behaviour has tended to focus either on Jewish or on hellenistic parallels and possible source materials, despite the fact that all scholars now give lip service at least to the belief that all ‘Judaism’ in the period was in any case a form of ‘hellenistic Judaism’.322 (We might comment that there are still two different ‘things’, the Jewish way of life and the Greek way of life, and that most first-century Jews not only knew this but lived with the tension; and that the scholarly problem has been precisely the failure to differentiate, in the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule itself, between religion (and between different sorts of religion), philosophy, culture, worldview and not least theology. Of course they are part of the same world, we should say; and of course they are in certain important respects radically different; and now can we please have the proper, differentiated and hermeneutically sensitive conversation?) As we shall see later on, Paul’s own view would be that it is because the followers of the Messiah are basically a strange new type of renewed Judaism that they are also, and for that very reason, renewed human beings… ([Location 12710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12710))

- One only has to think, as before, of the Maccabaean literature for the point to emerge clearly. If Antiochus’s torturers can persuade Eleazar to eat just a little pork, or even to pretend to, the game will be over; but he won’t, and so he goes to his horrible death.323 For Paul, though it may seem shocking to some and unbelievable to others, the one God made pigs and clams as well as cows, sheep and chickens, and pork and shellfish will be quite clean enough if you thank God for it.324 So too, as we have seen, with circumcision and the sabbath; so too, interestingly, with endogamous marriage. Someone who wishes to marry may do so ‘in the lord’; within prescribed boundaries, but not within prescribed ethnic boundaries.325 There is a clear restriction to ‘marrying within the family’, but the ‘family’ in question has nothing to do with parentage, tribe or ethnos. The reason is not far to seek: these symbols – food, circumcision, sabbath, family – had marked out the Jewish people as the special people of the one God, and Paul’s entire messianic worldview is based on the belief that that was a God-given status which… ([Location 12727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12727))

Because, as we shall see, he argues in great detail that there has been a change, a new moment, a fulfilment of promise which makes the initial preparatory stages redundant, it has been all too easy for generations of readers for whom a Kantian view of ‘ethics’ is part of the assumed, unexamined worldview to guess that he is saying about the Old Testament what such readers wanted to say about the whole Bible: that it no doubt contains some important material but that it must be sifted in the light of the new saeculum that has dawned upon the world with the Enlightenment.327 It is this… ([Location 12742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12742))
- Once we get past that problem, new clarity emerges. Paul not only redefined the Jewish praxis, leaving behind elements that were now irrelevant in his Messiah-based inaugurated eschatology and unified ecclesiology; he also intensified it. What have often been called the ‘moral standards’ or ‘ethical imperatives’ in his key texts show no sign of a slackening of demand, and in fact indicate on the contrary a standard of perfection at which one might well blanch. Violent, angry behaviour on the one hand and sexual misbehaviour on the other feature regularly on the list. The impulses towards such things must not just be tamed, as in some softer versions of popular philosophy (and, interestingly enough, in 4 Maccabees): they must be killed off. ‘Those who belong to the Messiah crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.’329 This is an all-out, no-holds-barred praxis, which Paul insists on not simply in terms of ‘see if you can, perhaps, eventually … manage to get somewhere reasonably near this’, but in terms of the wholesale adoption of a worldview with its concomitant praxis. The aim is a personal mindset, nested within a community worldview, in which certain styles of behaviour will not even be named, not (of… ([Location 12749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12749))

- Thus, for instance, divorce between Messiah-people is not allowed, and if it does happen the wife who has initiated the divorce must stay single thereafter or be reconciled to the original husband. Paul actually specifies that possibility (the wife divorcing the husband); it is not clear whether this is as an example of the larger category which would include the husband divorcing the wife, or whether he intends this permission to apply only in one direction. In other words, within the one family (i.e. of the ekklēsia), divorce and remarriage will count as adultery.331 However, when the issue between spouses is that one partner is a ‘believer’ and the other is not, the believer is ‘not bound’ if the unbeliever wishes to separate. That, I take it, means that the abandoned believing spouse is free to remarry – ‘only in the lord’, as when one is widowed.332 This is a remarkably careful distinction of cases. The underlying principle which makes sense of it is that the new community, the single family which is the central symbol of Paul’s worldview, is the primary thing that matters. The behaviour of ‘individuals’ (which is, of course, the centre of everything for Kantian ‘ethics’ and indeed for the ancient Stoic ethics that some want to use as a Procrustean bed onto which to force Paul) is to be aligned with the vocation of that community.… ([Location 12762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12762))

- This is why, more broadly, Paul’s sexual ethic (to call it that for the moment) is not simply the application to such matters of a ‘property’ code as opposed to a ‘purity’ code.334 ‘Paul’s explicit concern … is not with what we might call “individual ethics”, but rather with the effect of such a misplaced person on the identity and purity of the group.’335 It is the community that matters first and foremost, and just as that community is greatly strengthened by the presence within it of persons who are giving themselves to the life of redefined and intensified holiness, so that community is endangered by the presence within it of persons whose whole personality, worldview and all, is heading in the other direction – not least when they are claiming a kind of Christian ‘liberty’ as their justification. As Horrell points out, in the list of unacceptable behaviours in 1 Corinthians 5.11 what Paul actually lists are not ‘vices’ but persons.336 Thus, in an opposite movement to that which has become taken for granted within contemporary post-Enlightenment western culture, Paul insists not only on seeing persons in the light of the whole community but on seeing actions in the light of the whole person. The act, in other words, cannot be split off from the whole person who is doing it, and who is thereby characterized; and the person… ([Location 12776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12776))

The community is supposed to live in reality how all humanity is supposed to live in theory. Perhaps the entire division between the two viewpoints in our own day (and Horrell’s theme of ‘solidarity and difference’ is nothing if not a contemporary perspective, and very interesting at that) is a symptom of a late-western cultural failure to grasp this essentially and shockingly Jewish perspective, complete with its inbuilt scandal of particularity.

- If Paul’s ‘ethic’ is thus both a redefined and intensified version of the Jewish way of life, we must also insist that, as with everything about his worldview, it is rooted specifically in the cross and resurrection of the Messiah. It is not, therefore, purely a matter of his getting some bits of his moral code from Judaism and some from non-Jewish sources.338 Nor is Paul’s a worldview-praxis which then allows the newly formed people simply to behave as everyone out on the street would expect good people to behave. It is precisely a way of drawing a distinction: you are lights, he says, shining in a dark world! You are in a battle, and must put on the armour! You can see ‘the works of the flesh’ exhibited all around you, and you must be different.339 ([Location 12803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12803))

- Paul thus arrives at the repeated statement of a worldview-praxis which is both what he wants the Messiah-people to have as their second nature, as a worldview-level assumption they do not even need to think about, and, however paradoxical this may be in terms of our own categories, something which will both overlap broadly with other human discourse on morality and send a signal to other communities that this particular family, though strange in some respects, is not behaving in the outlandish way they might suppose. We see here, in fact, the beginnings of that line of thought which emerges in its full paradoxical glory in the Apologists of the second century: on the one hand they insist that they are good, law-abiding and indeed often exemplary citizens, and on the other hand they insist that they will not conform to some of the otherwise expected norms of the ruling pagan worldview, such as taking part in emperor-worship, the ultimate test of civic loyalty.340 This double-edged stance is not, in fact, an anomaly or an attempt to have one’s moral cake and eat it, but flows once more straight from the underlying worldview and theology: the one community, rooted in the one God, is to be the true humanity. Unless Paul had held a very Manichaean theology of human evil, according to which there could be nothing whatever right about anyone who was not a member of the household of faith, he must have held, and did in fact hold, that there was a large degree of overlap in moral perception. All people know in their bones, he says in Romans 1, how they ought to behave; it’s just that they choose (in one way or another) to go… ([Location 12810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12810))
- But, however much there is an obvious cross-over between the Christian vision of genuine humanness and that which is glimpsed in the pagan world, there is also, in the same passage, a clear statement on the need to follow a specific model of life, namely that of Paul himself: ‘these are the things you should do,’ he writes: ‘what you learned, received, heard and saw in and through me.’343 Here is the strange double effect which results directly from the community’s founding monotheism, corresponding more or less exactly to the well-known distinction between (a) the Jewish monotheism which worshipped one God quite strictly and (b) the pagan varieties of monotheism in which many different divinities and religious systems could all be lumped together into a cheerful synthetic whole.344 The people of the one Jewish God, now made known (as far as Paul was concerned) in and through Jesus and the spirit, were to celebrate good examples of humanity wherever they saw them. They were to live in such a way that would commend itself to their pagan neighbours. But they were also to follow a strict way of life which would mark them out.… ([Location 12829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12829))

- Enough for our present purposes to note the central point: the praxis of the single, united family cannot simply be analyzed in terms of an individual ‘ethic’ which stands at a subordinate place in the worldview or mindset of Paul. As Geertz stresses (in his terms of ‘world view’ and ‘ethos’), the praxis, symbol, questions and stories of a worldview all belong tightly together. In this case, Paul insisted on the praxis which was to become, not just a miscellaneous or from-time-to-time lifestyle choice, but part of the assumed mental furniture of the ekklēsia: the praxis of being ‘new humanity’, reflecting to the world, through its unity and holiness, the image of the one God which had been reflected fully and for ever ‘in the face of Jesus the Messiah’.

- Paul’s account of himself is that he is ‘in the Messiah’. That frequent self-description goes back to the deeply personal, but also typical, account in Galatians 2.19–20: he died to the law so as to live to God, by being crucified with the Messiah and now being alive again but with the Messiah’s life rather than his own. He does not often say this so personally and obviously, but like a good worldview element we are aware of it, just below the surface, throughout the rest of his writing. And, being a Messiah-person, he effortlessly and naturally understands himself to be living in the suddenly erupting new act of a much longer drama, the story of the one God, his people and the world. He assumes this scriptural narrative, its climax in Jesus as Messiah and his death and resurrection, and his own role in implementing what Jesus had achieved. If anything is worldview-stuff for Paul, this is it. It is the air he breathes. It works itself out in the elements we studied before: prayer, scripture, sacraments.

- When we place the idea of ‘belonging to the (crucified and risen) Messiah’ alongside the specific apostolic call to preach (and live by) the gospel, three other things stand out. First, Paul is involved in a cosmic struggle. He mentions the satan often enough for us to understand that he sees all kinds of events, large and small, in terms of an implicit ongoing battle in which he is involved like a middle-ranking officer on a foggy day: remembering the orders he has received, able to see and hear some of what’s going on, but often finding himself caught up, along with the people for whom he is responsible, in larger struggles whose overall shape he partially intuits without usually knowing the whole thing, or indeed any of it for sure. He knows that the battle is already won, but on his bit of the field it usually doesn’t feel like that. (We note that some of his most glorious imagery about victory already accomplished, such as the passage about the powers and authorities being led in bedraggled captivity behind Jesus in his triumph, are found in letters written from prison.) If that is what we were to mean by ‘apocalyptic’, Paul would be, in this sense, an irreducibly ‘apocalyptic’ figure; though the full sweep of Jewish thought from early times through to the middle ages at least suggests that this sense of spiritual warfare is by no means confined to so-called ‘apocalyptists’ and their writings.

- Paul, in any case, believes in the reality of unseen powers that sometimes show themselves in real-time political events and sometimes in less obvious ways. He believes that these powers have been defeated by the Messiah in his death, and that the ongoing battle is the outworking of that victory. And he believes that the ‘revelation’ which took place in the Messiah himself, and which now takes place when Jesus is announced as lord, provides the revelatory clue, the ultimate apokalypsis, which makes sense, as a good ‘apocalypse’ should, of the two key areas which an ancient seer might want to investigate: (a) creation, cosmology and new creation and (b) past, present and future. What is more, the ‘revelation’ to which Paul referred not only made sense of these and drew them together. It also made clear, as we see from his own account in Galatians 1, his own role in both, subordinate to the central and defining role of the Messiah himself.

- Second, and consequently, he suffered in all kinds of ways. We have already looked at this in terms of characteristic ‘praxis’. For Paul, this was basic and non-negotiable. It was part of ‘being in the Messiah’. There is none of the eager martyr about him in the way that there is with Ignatius of Antioch, but there is certainly nothing of the Stoic either, rising loftily above personal feelings and regarding bodily pain as irrelevant to happiness. ([Location 12893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12893))
- Third, Paul was a pastor. He tells the Thessalonians that he had been like a nurse with them; the Galatians, that he is like a mother going into labour once more. We can safely deduce from these, as we can from 1 Corinthians 13, that Paul really was that sort of person; and, as back-up evidence, we can see his personal concern writ large in the paragraphs about Timothy and Epaphroditus in Philippians, and above all in the letter to Philemon. He was a pastor, and a pastor’s pastor. It shines through: an armchair theologian would have told the Corinthians that it was better to be strong than to be weak, and that the weak should get over it, or get used to it. They should come into line. Paul, the ‘strong’, held all the cards, all the theological high ground. But the pastor’s insight, shaped and informed by the message of the cross, insists that human beings do not change their deep worldview-praxis (such as not eating certain foods) overnight. Conscience matters, and Paul will not squelch it. He might of course have learned that ‘principle’ from a book (which one?). Far more likely that he knew it in his bones, from years on the road, in the market-place, in the little room behind the tentmaker’s shop, agonizing with this person and that about what it meant, in real, practical terms, to follow Jesus the Messiah, to be part of the new monotheistic community, to live within a newly redefined worldview after the disappearance of most of the previous symbols, which would have helped one get one’s bearings.

- When you write like Paul seems to have done, at one level you think very hard about what you are doing, but at another level it just happens. Large-scale planning may be going on in your head or on scraps of parchment, but at that point there is an easy commerce of the old and the new, of conscious and subconscious. Finally, you glimpse it, you feel it, it emerges from somewhere, you write it (or dictate it), and it’s done. By the time Paul wrote Romans, writing was part of the praxis of his mindset, a symphonist at the top of his game. The letters were part pastoral, part a substitute for his own presence; as theoreticians were already pointing out in his day, that’s what a letter was and did.354 But they were also writing: quality writing to match the new thing which Paul must be credited with inventing, that specific, odd, craggy yet harmonious thing we call Christian theology, which demands new genres in which rhetoric, poetry, explanation, persuasion, scriptural exposition, warning and devotion rub shoulders and declare themselves members together of a new family. Whether we agree with him or not, his letters deserve their place (to put it with cheerful anachronism) not only in the Church Times or the Christian Century but also in the Times Literary Supplement and the New York Review of Books. They break the several different moulds, from which they emerge, just as did Paul’s theology itself. Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning. If Seneca didn’t read Romans, which he almost certainly didn’t, it is a pity: he would have been puzzled by much of the content, but he would have recognized that this man had something to say and knew how to say it. With style. ([Location 12924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=12924))
- Finally, there is the Collection. We may imagine that when Paul set off for the first time on his travels, he had little idea what would happen, how things would work out, or how, if things went well, the folk back in Jerusalem would react to the news of all those pagans coming in to join Abraham’s family. But at a certain point the idea had formed in his mind and his prayerful heart, and it soaked down so that it came to dominate his plans and hopes. Building on the little line about remembering the poor, from that early visit to Jerusalem,355 we find him mounting a large-scale strategy, with the disaster in Ephesus (whatever it was) intervening in the middle, and the rebellion in Corinth (whoever caused it) threatening to jeopardize the whole thing. He sticks at it, as we see him doing in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, because it has become part of his mental furniture, the will to plant a symbol not only in his own churches but also in Jerusalem itself, a symbol which would say what his whole worldview said, that Abraham has one family, not two, and that that family consists of all those who share Messiah-faith, and who live together by the rule of agapē. The Collection was thus umbilically linked to the most central elements in his worldview (and it collected other elements on the way, such as the masterful christological and then theological underpinning of the exhortation to generosity356). It was a fundamental expression of his central aims as an apostle, a direct outworking of the gospel he preached and lived.

- It is a truth insufficiently acknowledged that a sensible worldview equipped with appropriate symbolic praxis must be in want of a story. This is not simply a plea entered, against the grain of the subject, from the quirky standpoint of a ‘narrative theologian’, translating everything into ‘story’ to conform to some contemporary fad.1 It is the hard-won observation of the study of worldviews in general, and of the early Christian worldview in particular. Indeed, until the narrative element has been recognized it is open to doubt whether one has yet fully understood what ‘worldview’ (in the sense I and others use the term) is all about.2 Symbols and actions mean what they mean within a worldview, and until that worldview has been expressed in terms of its underlying story it will not be clear what that meaning is.

- To ‘demythologize’, as Bultmann insisted we must do, is not merely to make a mistake about ‘what we can and can’t believe in the modern world’. It is to insist on screening out one of the fundamental strands of meaning in a worldview. In any worldview. One can understand why someone whose national story had gone so badly wrong as Bultmann’s had (fancy living in Germany through the first half of the twentieth century!) might want to sweep all stories aside. But that is to lock up all the daughters because one has brought shame on the family. ([Location 13642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13642))

- The main problem with Bultmann’s proposal, in addition to the muddling of different senses of ‘myth’, is that when he insisted that we should strip the early Christian world of its ‘mythology’ he meant not only that we should express the existential challenge of the gospel without its pre-Enlightenment scientific assumptions, but also that we should re-conceptualize the gospel in a non-narratival form, reducing it to the pure existential challenge of every moment, in which one is called to hear God’s word now rather than think in terms of the waste, sad time stretching before and after.8 ([Location 13646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13646))

- What is more, Bultmann’s analysis corresponded easily, and unsurprisingly given his history-of-religions move in the early 1930s, to the implicit narrative of various types of gnosticism: (1) a human, unaware that a spark of divine life is hidden within this clod of earth; (2) the arrival of revelation, perhaps even of a Revealer, whose word draws attention to this inner spark; (3) the human, now living in tune with this inner spark, abandoning the concerns of the clod of earth. The shape of the narrative proposed by Bultmann for the New Testament is thus the same as that of gnosticism.10 ([Location 13659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13659))

- Hardly anyone today would offer such a ‘gnostic’ or even ‘proto-gnostic’ context, or even narrative, as the best and most appropriate context for understanding Paul. But that does not mean that Bultmann’s influence has been shrugged off. His treatment was just one aspect of the essentially deJudaizing programme, supposedly in the service of a proper ‘Pauline’ theology, that characterized a good deal of scholarship between the wars. Such a thing, it was assumed, meant a proper protestant theology, in which one would highlight ‘justification by faith apart from works of the law’ in some sense or other; Bultmann’s followers continue to squabble over what sense precisely will work within this paradigm. After all (so ran the implicit imperative throughout such work), we know that Paul rejected ‘Judaism’ and the ‘works of the law’ which stood at its heart; we know he was the ‘apostle to the gentiles’; very well then, he must have left behind not only the specifics of self-righteous Jewish theology but also the thought-forms of Judaism as a whole. He must, therefore, have recast the message into non-Jewish forms, and we should try to discern what those forms were.12 Since ‘justification by faith apart from law’ appears to imply a strong critique of Jewish theology and/or religion (that and/or represents a fateful move within the discipline, from which we are still trying to recover), the best means of advancing such an analysis, it was thought, would be a history-of-religions account in which Judaism as a source of Paul’s ideas or beliefs was pushed aside, and anything – Stoicism, hellenistic rhetoric, mystery religions, gnosticism, whatever, so long as it was not Jewish – would then be brought in to fill the gap. And, though one may indeed find brief three-stage narratives about personal faith, self-discovery or ethical advancement within such a framework, one will not find larger narratives.13 That is part of the point. Larger narratives are what scholarship was getting away from. They reminded people too much of the large, powerful story told by the Jews. And, like the story told by the Jews, they might begin to compete with the large, implicit stories which were buried but powerful – all the more powerful, in fact, for being buried – within western modernism.

- Not all non-narratival proposals, of course, are Bultmannian, just as not all narratival proposals are clearly anti-Bultmannian in their aims, methods and results. But, with due awareness of the dangers of oversimplification, we may comment that a great many of today’s debates about the first two centuries of Christian history boil down to this question: were the early Christians aware, or were they not aware, of living within a narrative that was larger than that of their own sin, salvation and spirituality?

- This, I suggest, is the deep, underlying point at which we can discern what the so-called ‘new perspective on Paul’ might really have been all about. It is not so much a matter of whether ‘Jews believed in grace too’, whether Paul was interested in ‘staying in’ rather than ‘getting in’, or whether the ‘solution’ preceded the ‘plight’ or vice versa, important though all those questions are. Rather, it was and is a matter of discerning whether the underlying narrative which we have seen to be so powerful for so many (not all) Jews in Paul’s day was taken over, modified or simply abandoned.14 For the ‘old perspective’, Paul had to ditch everything about his previous worldview, theology and culture – the old symbols, the ancient stories, the praxis, the view of God himself. For the ‘new perspective’, in its manifold and frequently contradictory manifestations, the skirmishing about what precisely Paul meant by ‘works of the law’ and so on has masked a much deeper question: did Paul actually reaffirm something basic about the underlying Jewish narrative, or did he reject it?

- Even the current revival of enthusiasm for something which, however confusingly, has appropriated the word ‘apocalyptic’ follows all too closely the thought of its paternal grandfather (the blood-lines seem to run, with variations, from Bultmann through Käsemann on the one side and from Schweitzer through Sanders on the other).15 ‘Apocalyptic’ as the breaker of ‘narrative’, the saving divine power ‘invading’ the world vertically from the outside without connection to anything that has gone before, can move in the direction of the same anti-narratival, or at least anti-Jewish-narratival, worldview. It has its own narrative, of course, but that corresponds, at a cosmic level, to Bultmann’s: first, the world (including the Jewish world with its ‘religion’) in chaos and darkness; second, the apocalypse, in this case the revelation of Jesus Christ and his world-overthrowing death; third, the new world thus opened up, complete with its freshly worked epistemology and… ([Location 13704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13704))

How it does not work is by elevating ‘apocalyptic’ as an overarching principle and insisting a priori that it rules out all continuity, all sense of a larger narrative within which the story of Jesus the Messiah, the story of Paul himself and the story of the communities he founded, make the sense they do.17 That is to deJudaize the… ([Location 13714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13714))
- Into this complex and often confusing set of debates, I propose, and shall now argue, that Paul’s worldview had a strongly implicit and frequently explicit narrative. Or rather, like most mature narratives, Paul’s worldview had a set of underlying stories whose tendency to interlock and overlap is not a weakness, but rather a sign that, as with a good novel or play, the sub-plots and secondary narratives not only illustrate but also materially effect key moments and key transitions in the main plot. Thus the story of Elizabeth and Darcy is balanced, within Pride and Prejudice, by the happy sub-plot of Jane and Bingley on the one hand and by the decidedly less happy sub-plot of Lydia and Wickham on the other. Both help the main story along. Darcy is after all Bingley’s friend; that is the only reason for his being welcomed into the Bennet household in the first place. But it is the darker sub-plot that provides the key to the main story. When Elizabeth learns of Darcy’s remarkable generosity to her undeserving brother-in-law, she glimpses a whole new side of his character, which opens the… ([Location 13720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13720))

- The whole quest for implicit story, whether in Paul or anyone else, is the hunt (as with Geertz, Berger and Luckman and others) for the signs of a worldview, and a worldview is precisely that which, like a pair of spectacles, you normally look through, not at. It is presupposed, and only comes to attention when challenged. To point out Paul’s lack of actual stories (there are surely more exceptions, as well: Romans 7.1—8.11 comes to mind, as does 9.6—10.21, but we shall let these pass for the moment) looks, at least to begin with, like a sort of category mistake: as though one were to declare that the singer could not be singing a song because she was not singing the words ‘a song’. To object that, because worldview-narratives do not lie on the surface of a text, one must assume that they do not exist, is like objecting that, because I have not up to this point written the words ‘I am sitting at a desk writing a book,’ I cannot therefore be sitting at a desk writing a book. Indeed, normally, if I were to write those words, it would mean that I was not writing a book, but something else – a letter, perhaps. Thus it is no objection to observe that Paul never says ‘Once upon a time’, and hardly ever lays out his material in an explicit narrative sequence with a beginning, a middle and an end. To observe this fact ought not to lead to the conclusion that Paul did not have a narratable gospel. ([Location 13753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13753))

- Even when a writer is writing a story, whether a novel, a short story or a play, the implicit worldview, and the narrative within which that worldview might come to expression, are highly unlikely to coincide with the narrative on the page. Whatever Jane Austen’s worldview may have been, and in whatever underlying narratives we might wish to express that (implicit, out-of-sight) worldview, it is highly unlikely to coincide with the actual order of events in Pride and Prejudice. That is the point of Norman Petersen’s well-known distinction between the poetic sequence (the order in which material appears in the text itself) and the referential sequence (the order in which, if we try to reconstruct the world which the text both presupposes and addresses, this same material, and more besides, will appear).23 Behind that referential sequence again there lies a deeper and more powerful implicit narrative, that which expresses the worldview within which the writer approaches the whole matter, and indeed the whole of life. As Petersen points out, using Philemon as a good example, the ‘poetic sequence’ in which Paul makes his case in the actual letter is not at all the same as the ‘referential sequence’ which must be reconstructed by any reader wishing to understand what the letter is about (an implicit narrative, whose details can of course be debated, about Onesimus running away or otherwise leaving Philemon, finding or being found by Paul, receiving the life-transforming message of the gospel, becoming a useful colleague, but now having to be sent back). As I showed in chapter 1, these two ‘sequences’ depend, for their fuller understanding, on the strongly implicit worldview, with its attendant theology, which comes to particular expression in this ‘poetic sequence’ as it addresses this ‘referential sequence’: a worldview about a good God, active in strange providence and in the story of Israel, but particularly in the gospel of the Messiah and the life and work of the apostle, challenging other worldviews with the implicit narrative of the exodus in its fully redemptive, Messiah-shaped form.

- The ‘story’ element in a worldview is not a matter of ‘whether this writer (or this community) sometimes articulates this or that in narrative form’: he or she may, or it may well emerge in some ritualized or symbolic fashion, but that is not the point. As with Geertz, Berger and Luckman, Petersen and the thousand writers who have made this and similar points (and with whom the real quarrel should take place if the dissenters want to pick one), I insist that it is possible in principle, and not actually difficult in practice, to discover within the larger worldview and mindset, to which we have remarkably good access, what implicit story Paul is telling, behind, above, underneath, in and through (whatever spatial metaphor you like) the particular things he says in this or that letter. Discerning this is not arcane, not dependent on some fancy French philosophy, not particularly difficult.26 ([Location 13838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=13838))
- As C. S. Lewis pointed out about words, when we read old books we go to the dictionaries to look up the hard words, the ones we don’t know at all. The apparently easy words, the ones we use every day, pass by us without our realizing the very different meaning they may have carried five centuries ago.28 So it is with texts in general. If we do not make the effort to check out the underlying worldview, we will all too easily assume that the writer shared, on this or that point, a worldview (including an implicit narrative) we ourselves know well. The writer must really have been talking ‘about’ what we assume he was talking about, and we ignore the hints within the text of a different worldview, a different underlying narrative. Paul ‘must really’ have been talking about ‘how I can find a gracious God’, and the turns and twists of his argument must then be explained as his use of this pre-Pauline tradition, that hellenistic topos, these themes his opponents introduced into the argument – anything rather than a narrative about the larger purposes of the God of Israel.

- Quite so: the ‘hard-handed’ players, whose performance Shakespeare has taken care shall be seen as comical in several directions at once, nevertheless contains the dark truth hidden underneath the rest of the drama, behind all the frustrations, anger and threats: lovers do sometimes get it horribly wrong, and in any case death awaits us all. Moonshine, having played a wide variety of parts, mythical and actual, throughout the drama, is there at the end, with Lion, ‘to bury the dead’.49 With that, the king can call the lovers to their nuptials, and to a two-week party, while Oberon can bestow his blessing on their future issue. The larger framing drama (Theseus and Hippolyta) has held the whole thing together, while the subordinate criss-crossing sub-plots, climaxing with the play within the play, have dealt with the underlying, otherwise unspoken, tensions and threats. And this whole drama, of course, takes its place on Shakespeare’s stage as itself a play ‘within the play’ of the ordinary lives and loves, fears and fantasies, of the audience and their society. A room full of mirrors; a plot full of plots; a comedy full of tragedy; a world full of stories. A lot like real life, in fact, complete with the Moon as, it seems, the symbol and herald of most if not all of the key moments, the key themes, the key revelations.

- Revelations! Aye, there’s the rub. The meaning of a ‘revelation’, we might suppose, is the job it does within the larger narrative: changing it, breaking in with fresh news, transforming it. But maybe (so someone will say) when Paul speaks of a ‘revelation’, an ‘apocalypse’, he has in mind not the kind of ‘revelation’ that comes about when new elements of a character are unveiled, but the sort of ‘revelation’ that would happen if the theatre manager came on stage in the middle of the performance, declared that the house was on fire, stopped all the plots and sub-plots in their tracks and sent the audience home. That, it seems, is what ‘apocalyptic’ is now taken to mean in some quarters. Thus, because Paul can be shown to express some elements at least of something that can be called ‘apocalyptic’, it is concluded, or at least proposed, that he cannot be living in, or encouraging others to live within, an ongoing narrative, with or without complexity of plot. Is that really the case? ([Location 14009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=14009))

- My proposal is that, having reminded ourselves of how narratives can interlock, with an overall quite simple narrative generating more complicated sub-plots which can interrelate, and with something happening near the heart which then turns the key in all the other locks, we might, by way of analogy, be able to bring some order to the chaos of speculation about the various ‘stories’ to be found within, underneath or around the edges of Paul’s writings. Just as we are focusing on one theme in his writings, something else is going on, as we might say, in another… ([Location 14018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=14018))
- I shall now suggest that these various stories do actually have a coherent interlocking shape, nesting within one another like the sub-plots in a play (I said like, not in exactly the same way). And, if anything more important, I shall begin to show (the rest of the book will continue this demonstration) that looking at Paul’s worldview with the aid of this narrative analysis sheds a positive flood of light – direct light, not surreptitious moonbeams – on passage after passage of tricky exegesis, and problem after problem in the theological coherence of the letters. That last comment, responding to those who have doubted whether all this talk of ‘story’ will have any ‘exegetical results’ or ‘payoff’, is more than just a rebuff to such scepticism. It is an indication of how the implicit hermeneutical spiral of my own method is supposed to work: having begun (a long time ago) with exegesis, I have been driven to worldview models to try to understand what early Christianity was all about. At every point, the aim is to be able to return to exegesis, not saying, ‘Well, that was an interesting diversion; now let’s get on with the real thing’, but ‘Now at last we can make sense of what before was incomprehensible.’52 ([Location 14033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=14033))

- Where, then, to start? The obvious answer is to begin with what seems the largest, framing story of all, which also happens to be the one element of narrative which is allowed even by the contemporary proponents of ‘apocalyptic’: the story of God and the world.

- The story of creator and cosmos is in fact everywhere presupposed. Paul assumes that the God of whom he speaks is the creator, the maker of heaven and earth. This God has made a world in which the signs of his power, glory and even his very deity ought to be picked up by humans.53 He has made all things, and humans can and should thank him for them all. ‘The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof’: Paul can quote obvious biblical statements of the worldview-shaping premise.54 There is one God from whom all things come, to whom we owe our allegiance, our very selves. ‘From him and through him and to him are all things.’55 ([Location 14049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=14049))

- By itself this is a statement, not a narrative. The creator God makes a world; the world belongs to him: that isn’t a story, any more than ‘The cat sat on the mat’ is a story. For a story, a narrative, something has to challenge the equilibrium of the original statement: ‘The mat caught fire,’ or ‘Up came a mouse and tweaked its tail.’ The reason there is a story about this God and his world is twofold. First, the creator God made a world with a purpose, and entrusted that purpose to humans: ah, now we have the beginning of a story – a quest, a task to be undertaken. Then, second, the humans to whom the task was entrusted abused that trust and rebelled. Now there is a problem to solve as well as a task to complete. It is not simply that the relationship between the creator and his world has become problematic. The purpose of that relationship appears to be thwarted. We are pitched into the plot at a point when everybody knows something has gone horribly wrong and everybody is wondering what can be done about it, how the original purpose can be put back on track.

The fact that creation itself had been subjected to decay did not mean that the creator had given up on the vision of a good creation in need of renewal. For Paul, the gospel rendered people more human, not less, renewing the vocation of bearing the divine image, reflecting the divine wisdom into the rest of the world and reflecting the praises of creation back to its maker. This vision carried, from the start, strong and sometimes subversive meaning for real, public life.15 ([Location 16915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=16915))

This promise, rooted in the events of the exodus, and applied to the need for holiness, is reiterated in Exodus, Leviticus and elsewhere.290 The same promise is linked directly, in Ezekiel 37 (the chapter, of course, which predicts the ‘resurrection’ of exiled Israel), to the regular covenantal promise ‘I will be their God and they shall be my people.’291 ([Location 19225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=19225))

- Take, first, Ezekiel 36. The prophet has already denounced God’s people up and down. Now he turns, not for Israel’s sake but for the sake of God’s own name, to the vision of how YHWH will reveal his salvation and thereby gain glory from the nations. This prophecy stands exactly in the tradition we have described in this chapter so far: But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that it was said of them, ‘These are the people of YHWH, and yet they had to go out of his land.’ But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came. Therefore say to the house of Israel … I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am YHWH, says the Sovereign YHWH, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes. I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes (en tois dikaiōmasin mou poreuēsthe) and be careful to observe my ordinances (kai ta krimata mou phylaxēsthe kai poiēsesthe).

- The point is repeated in Galatians, after the list of the ‘works of the flesh’: ‘people who do such things’, Paul declares, ‘will not inherit God’s kingdom’.296 And it is expanded in Ephesians 5: You should know this, you see: no fornicator, nobody who practises uncleanness, no greedy person (in other words, an idolator), has any inheritance in the Messiah’s kingdom, or in God’s. Don’t let anyone fool you with empty words. It’s because of these things, you see, that God’s wrath is coming on people who are disobedient.  So don’t share in their practices. After all, at one time you were darkness, but now, in the lord, you are light! So behave as children of light. Light has its fruit, doesn’t it, in everything that’s good, and just, and true. Think through what’s going to be pleasing to the lord. Work it out.297 We should probably take the double ‘kingdom’, of the Messiah and of God himself, in the same sense as we find in 1 Corinthians 15.20–8. There the Messiah is already ruling, and will hand over the kingdom to his father once he has overcome all his enemies, death itself being the last. Thus here in Ephesians 5 ‘the Messiah’s kingdom’ presumably indicates the present ‘rule of the Messiah’ in and through the present church (as I suggested above), and ‘God’s kingdom’ presumably looks ahead, as with 1 Corinthians 6 and Galatians 5, to the time when the one God will be ‘all in all’.298 Once again the warning comes in connection with habits and lifestyles, especially in the area of sexual behaviour, which destroy genuine humanness, and from which faith, baptism and entry into the community of the Messiah’s people ought to deliver people.299 ([Location 30735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=30735))

The two biblical positions belong in fact within the same narrative: (i) at the moment, God has given the pagan rulers sovereignty, and Israel must navigate its way to a seeking of the welfare of the city which does not compromise its ultimate loyalty, but (ii) the time will come when God will overthrow the wicked pagans, not only rescuing Israel but setting it up as the new, alternative world kingdom.

- for Paul the gospel of Jesus the Messiah created and sustained a particular community. For Paul, those who were en Christō constituted a ‘people’, a family of ‘brothers and sisters’, with mutual ties and obligations indicated by the word koinōnia. Their allegiance to Jesus as Christos and kyrios, and to one another within this ‘fellowship’, was their primary identity. This community, astonishingly in the ancient world as in the modern, was by its very nature composed of people of all sorts on an even footing: Jews and non-Jews, rich and poor, slave and free, male and female. This remarkable unity across otherwise universal dividing-lines was balanced by an equally remarkable insistence on firm boundaries to do with belief and behaviour. There were plenty of questions as to where precisely those boundaries were to be located (much of 1 Corinthians deals with questions of that sort), but nobody doubted that such boundaries existed. Paul assumed, then, as a matter of worldview, sustained by his detailed theology, that those en Christō were a distinct family, and were to live as such.

- The central symbol of Paul’s worldview, therefore (the united and holy community), already constituted a challenge both to the implicit assumptions of communities in the ancient world and, more specifically, to the empire of Rome. While Paul’s churches remained small – we have frustratingly little information about actual numbers, but in most cases we can safely assume communities of a few dozen at most in towns and cities which numbered in the tens or hundreds of thousands – the impact will have been marginal, and the consequent threat small.23 But by the end of Paul’s life, which we assume to have been in the 60s under Nero, the Christians in Rome at least were sufficient in number to be used as scapegoats for civic disaster. Though other reasons may have been given as well (non-worship of traditional gods being the obvious one), the fact that they were known as a group with its own strong and non-traditional identity will have meant that from the very beginning the Christians, simply by being what Paul believed they were, will have raised eyebrows, then hackles, then suspicions. Before we even mention state cults, emperor-worship and the like, we should reckon that what Paul assumed as a matter of worldview about the followers of Jesus, and what he taught about the redefinition of the Jewish doctrine of election, set him and his communities on a collision course not only with the empire but with many deep-rooted assumptions in the normal civic life of the ancient world.

- ‘The resurrection of the dead’ had already happened – in the person of the Messiah. For Paul this could only mean that Jesus himself was already enthroned as the world’s true lord. The tension of ‘now’ and ‘not yet’ which has regularly been seen as characteristic of his vision of Christian living is if anything even more important in terms of his vision of Jesus as world ruler. Obviously there was still a ‘not yet’, and Paul was aware of it with every beating he endured, every minute he spent in prison, every time he looked out on a world still full of idolatry, tyranny, wickedness and death. But, equally obviously from his writings, there was a ‘now’ that had not been there before. ‘The Messiah has to go on ruling, you see,’ he wrote to the Corinthians, ‘until “he has put all his enemies under his feet”.’ Jesus was, in other words, already ruling the world, as the Psalmist had promised, even though that rule still awaited its final triumph.24 As with everything else to do with the future Jewish hope, Paul believed both that it had already arrived and that it was yet to arrive. If this was true for his view, say, of resurrection itself, it was every bit as true for his vision of the divine purpose for the pagan empires of the world. As a Pharisaic Jew, he had believed both that the nations were already under the strange providential rule of the one God (so that one should live peacefully under pagan rule for the time being), and that the one God would sooner or later bring about the great cosmic change through which his people would be ruling the world instead. The tension between the two halves of this belief constituted, broadly, the dividing-line between what can loosely be called the school of Hillel and the school of Shammai, with the Hillelites content to live at peace under the ([Location 36018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=36018))

- For Paul, inaugurated eschatology precipitated a new mode of the Pharisaic/Jewish political challenge. And if the ‘not yet’ indicated that there was still a sense of ‘living peacefully under the world’s rulers’, the ‘now’ indicated that something new had none the less happened. The Messiah ‘rises up to rule the nations’; it had already happened, and Paul was there to announce it and to make it a reality.26 This cannot be other than politically subversive, even though the nature of that subversion will not map on to the models we have assumed. But of one thing we can be sure. Daniel 7 had spoken of a sequence of four monsters. Everyone in the 160s BC would have identified the fourth monster as Syria. Everyone in the first century AD would have identified it as Rome. For someone steeped in the Jewish apocalyptic tradition, as Paul was, it would have been impossible to imagine that Rome was ‘insignificant’.

Their use of Israel’s scriptures was of quite a different order from the way their pagan neighbours ‘used’, or at least presupposed, Homer and the poets. They did not order their lives around the harmony of the local polis, or take any responsibility for it. They had no priestly hierarchy.

This primary obligation was the principal thing that had to be done over and over again, just as animal sacrifice was done in both the pagan and the Jewish worlds as the means by which the gods and humans could live together in harmony, solidarity and in community, and in particular the means by which the normal agricultural basis for human life would be blessed and assured of continuity and fruitfulness. The word ‘present’, paristēmi/parastanō, used in the passage just quoted from Romans 6 when Paul is speaking of ‘presenting’ one’s body to God for his purposes, has a wide range of meaning. But it can also be used much more specifically as a technical term for the ‘presenting’ of a sacrifice.50 ([Location 37631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=37631))

- When we ask, as we must in this chapter, how the Paul we have come to know might have responded to the philosophical world of his day, we might be forgiven for thinking that he would sweep it all away with a single wave of the hand: The word of the cross, you see, is madness to people who are being destroyed. But to us – those who are being saved – it is God’s power. This is what the Bible says, after all:  I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;  the shrewdness of the clever I’ll abolish. Where is the wise person? Where is the educated person? Where is the debater of this present age? Don’t you see that God has turned the world’s wisdom into folly? This is how it’s happened: in God’s wisdom, the world didn’t know God through wisdom, so it gave God pleasure, through the folly of our proclamation, to save those who believe.

- Another fine rhetorical flourish announcing the folly of all human rhetoric! Perhaps, though, this is more than a simple dismissal; as usual, Paul writes at more than one level. God’s folly, he goes on to say, creates its own new genres of ‘wisdom’: We do, however, speak wisdom among the mature. But this isn’t a wisdom of this present world, or of the rulers of this present world – those same rulers who are being done away with. No: we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery. This is the wisdom God prepared ahead of time, before the world began, for our glory.4 ([Location 38152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38152))

- That, in a measure, is the story of the two letters to Corinth: a firm denial that Paul’s gospel owes anything to human wisdom, coupled with a careful construction of an alternative ‘wisdom’ which, hidden for long ages, has now been revealed. We see the same thing in one of his central discussions, when he dismisses ‘knowledge’ of the merely human sort. It puffs you up, he says, but love builds you up. Thus: If anybody thinks they ‘know’ something, they don’t yet ‘know’ in the way they ought to know. But if anybody loves God, they are ‘known’ – by him.5 This trumping of human knowledge by divine knowledge, and by the ‘love’ that is the proper name for the latter, recurs as a theme in the exquisite poem of chapter 13: ([Location 38158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38158))

- There is, then, an epistemological revolution at the heart of Paul’s worldview and theology. It isn’t just that he now knows things he did not before; it is, rather, that the act of knowing has itself been transformed. This has been an important sub-theme in some recent writing on Paul, but it has not always, in my judgment, been explored to the full, or necessarily helpfully.7 Ordinary human wisdom, ordinary human knowledge, is not just cancelled. It is taken up into something at one level similar and at another level radically different.

Much scholarship is now well aware that ignoring these problems produces gross and distorting historical oversimplification. The deeper problem is that those two labels, with their apparent but pseudo-historical validation, have been used to designate two competing ideologies, setting up a Procrustean bed on which different thinkers can be placed and to whose shape they can be fitted by a process of philosophical, cultural and not least historical torture.

We cannot pretend that the Roman–Jewish war of 66–70, or the great revolt of 132–5, were simply outbreaks of ordinary anti-imperial revolution, though of course they were that as well. As we have seen, most Jews in the first century thought of themselves as significantly different from their non-Jewish neighbours; most non-Jews recognized this significant difference, which showed up in a variety of ways; and many Jewish thinkers and writers of the time brought this to articulation in a range of writings, in a variety of different genres and styles, expressing and urging what they saw as a specifically Jewish worldview.

- It is too easy to assume that, as a zealous Pharisaic Jew, he would simply sweep them all away as so much skybala, trash. Certainly that is not what he seems to be saying in some of the key passages: whatever is true, holy and so on is what one should think about, wherever it may be found. Paul of course believed that he had been given insight into all things, all wisdom, through the divine pneuma, the spirit of the Messiah.17 This kind of wisdom already made the ‘wisdom of the world’ look like foolishness to him.18 But precisely because this spirit was the spirit of the one God who had made the whole world Paul expected that there might be points of overlap, of congruence.19 He would indeed regard it as his right and calling to ‘take every thought prisoner and make it obey the Messiah’, but there were plenty of thoughts out there which, he might have judged, would be ready servants if only they were bought up and employed within the right household.

- The philosophers, as we saw, divided their investigations into three: physics, ethics and logic. ‘Theology’, already named as a topic by the time of Plato, was subsumed under ‘physics’; it was part of ‘what there was’, what the ‘nature’ of the whole world might be. The three topics were closely related: the question of how to behave, individually and socially (‘ethics’), was directly related to the analysis of the world, which included an analysis of what it meant to be human (‘physics’). ‘Logic’ was a matter of understanding and employing an epistemology that was coherent with the results of both ‘physics’ and ‘ethics’. These three topics formed the playing-fields on which the different schools did battle over particular issues.

- If we are to give Paul free rein to address the philosophers, everything we know about him suggests that before getting into details, either on the three main topics or the proposals of the different schools, he would want to challenge the basic tripartite scheme itself. He himself does indeed have a view about ‘what there is’ and how it has come to be, and about the nature and role of humans within that. But for him the crucial question of ‘theology’ is not one sub-topic of investigation within that, but forms the much larger world within which ‘physics’ itself (not that he calls it that) ought to be located. Paul, in other words, remains a traditional Jew, believing that the one God of Abraham is not an item within the cosmos to be investigated like everything else, but the one ‘from whom, through whom, and to whom are all things’.22 He would, in other words, want to take the idea of ‘god’ out of the category of ‘physics’ in which pagan philosophy had placed it, seeing such placing as itself a failure to realize who the one God actually was. This single move already implies a radical change not only in ‘physics’, where ‘the gods’ had been located, but in ‘ethics’ and ‘logic’ as well, which were closely integrated with that basic analysis. Unless Paul was to break with his Jewish tradition entirely, ‘ethics’ would never be, for him, simply a matter of discerning the ‘nature’ either of the world, or of humans, and trying to live in accordance with it, though it would always involve that as well. It would always involve a direct address, a command, from the one God who is not part of the cosmos, nor yet detached from it, but remains in sovereign and dynamic relation with it.

But Paul was aware, partly because of Israel’s scriptures and their vision of the one God, and partly because of what he believed about the Messiah, both that the darkness was deeper than had been thought and that a new day had already dawned which enabled one to see things that were previously invisible – including, remarkably, the one God himself, revealed in his ‘image’.27 Both of these – the deeper darkness and the new dawn – are important if we are to understand his epistemology and the way it related to, and in some respects challenged, the views of his contemporaries.

- Paul is not simply stating that unbelievers have ‘darkened’ or blinded minds. He is providing a kind of historical aetiology for that condition, dependent for its full force on echoes of Genesis 3. Nor is he saying that the first humans knew God by observation of the created world but that since the Fall this has not been the case. He seems to be saying both that people still do have a basic knowledge of God and that everybody covers this up and learns distorted patterns of thought which result in, and are then in turn intensified by, distorted patterns of behaviour. It is no part of our purpose here to unravel all the mysteries of this paragraph in Romans 1. We have looked at those elsewhere.32 What matters is Paul’s overall point, throughout these various passages: the problem of true knowledge is not merely that appearances deceive, or that people make wrong inferences, but rather that human rebellion against the one God has resulted in a distortion and a darkening of the knowledge that humans have, or still ought to have. Paul would want to say to the philosophers that wisdom is not simply a matter of learning to see, like the owls, in ordinary darkness. It is a matter of the one God piercing the darkness and bringing new light, the light of new creation, and at the same time opening the eyes that have been blinded by ‘the god of this world’ so that they can see that light.

- The claim in 1 Corinthians 2 might appear to create a kind of private epistemological world. Paul might be taken to be referring to an inner sanctum of spirit-given ‘knowledge’, which would cut off the possessor from all ordinary human knowledge, and also cut off the non-possessor from any access to the gospel. Paul, however, clearly does not believe this. In fact, he sees it the other way round: as far as he is concerned, the closed, private world is the dark and dangerous ‘natural world’ where most people live. To this extent, and to this extent only, his epistemology could be seen on the analogy with Plato’s famous picture of the Cave.36 The people in the cave are restricted in their knowledge because all they can see is a distorted set of shadows and reflections. The ones who turn to the light and come out of the cave can then see everything clearly, including the things that were producing the flickering images they could see before. Paul believed that when his powerful gospel was proclaimed it opened people’s eyes to the reality not only of the one God and his Messiah but also to the realities of the rest of the world, including those areas where they would have obligations and duties. Precisely because the God in whom Paul believed was the one God of creation, as we shall see in more detail in a moment, he believed that knowledge of this God – or rather, as he himself puts it, being known by this God – opened a person’s eyes to see the whole world as it truly was.

- No doubt Paul would recognize that the people he calls ‘unspiritual’ or ‘merely human’ would think that it was they who were seeing the world truly. Paul would expect them to repay his compliment and suggest that it was actually Paul and others like him who were living in a world of private fantasy. That might, as well, be Paul’s own verdict on (for instance) the adherents of the mystery religions. But what Paul believed about what the philosophers called ‘physics’ – namely, that there was one God who had made the whole world through his second self, the one whom Paul knew as Jesus the Messiah – meant that knowledge of this one God and one lord, in a mind renewed by the one true spirit, provided an unrivalled knowledge of the world as it really was. Just as the philosophers linked logic to physics, and both to ethics, so Paul’s epistemology reflected exactly his vision of divinely created reality.

- His regular use of the tools of argument shows that, for him, the understanding and wisdom he wishes his hearers to possess must mesh with their understanding of everything else. He is not inviting them to share a small, private world. He is helping them to think through public truth. Paul would therefore wish to say to the philosophers of his day that, though their aim of thinking everything through and proceeding by logical steps from the known to the unknown was right and proper, they were always in danger of being trapped in the darkness from which they claimed to be able to free others. Above all, his eschatological vision meant that as far as he was concerned the night was already nearly over, and those who belonged to the Messiah were able to see clearly things which were still puzzling to everybody else. The owls of Athens might claim to see in the dark, but once the new day was dawning a new kind of seeing would be available.

- The second category of ancient philosophical investigation is the large and many-sided topic of ‘physics’: what there is in physis, nature. As we saw in the introductory remarks to this chapter, for Paul this did not include ‘god’ or ‘the gods’, because the one God was the creator of the world, not part of it. Though he never discusses head on the question of how the world came to be, every time he gets near the question, in pursuit of a different theme, it is clear what his answer would be. He assumes the ancient Jewish view that the world is the creation of the one God, and that therefore it is not to be identified with that God (as in pantheism) nor to be seen as the disastrous handiwork either of blind chance (the Epicurean view) or of a malevolent subsidiary deity (as in some gnostic systems). But Paul has gone a step further than this Jewish view. He has taken the ancient scriptural theme of ‘wisdom’ as the divine assistant in creation, and has construed this dramatically in terms of Jesus himself – or rather, we should say, in terms of the mysterious one, the second self of the one God, who became human in and as Jesus of Nazareth.

- It is this robust version of the Jewish monotheistic doctrine of creation that underlies Paul’s equally robust affirmation that the present world of space, time and matter is itself good. That is why marital union is good in itself (1 Corinthians 7), why all meat is good in itself, even if offered to an idol (1 Corinthians 8, 10), why all time, all days, are basically the same in the sight of the one God (Romans 14.5). Here we see the creational element of Paul’s inaugurated eschatology. One might have imagined that, if the new creation had already been launched, everything about the old one would become not only irrelevant but somehow shabby, tarnished, shown up as in some sense actually evil, so that Paul would be advocating escape. Not at all. For Paul the old creation has, of course, been relativized. It no longer assumes cultural, or even cultic, significance. But it remains good, and can be enjoyed if received with thanksgiving.43 The new world, already launched with Jesus’ resurrection, reaffirms the essential goodness of the old one even as it relativizes its ultimate significance. As with the biblical texts on which he drew, Paul understood the entire created order not as a static entity to be observed but as part of a narrative, a narrative which had now, he believed, entered its long-awaited new phase.

- The God in whom Paul believed was present to and within the world, and especially to and within human beings, but was not contained within the world or humans. Rather, he was present alongside, and in a sense over against, the world and humans, guiding, calling to account, challenging and enabling. He was present, supremely and shockingly, in Jesus himself, a human of recent memory; and he was present in a special way, different on the one hand from his presence in Jesus but different on the other hand from his presence everywhere else, in those who were now indwelt by ‘the spirit of Jesus’. Such people were pneumatikoi, ‘spirit-animated’ people, as opposed to the merely psychikoi, humans whose inner principle was the psychē, the ordinary human life rather than the Jesus-shaped divine life.47 ([Location 38508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38508))

- The questions English-language exegetes sometimes ask, as to whether ‘spirit’ should have a capital letter or not, indicating the divine spirit rather than the human one, shows well enough that there is fluidity of thought at this point. And this fluidity is found not only at the interrelation, in specifically Christian terms, between the divine spirit (or the spirit of Jesus) and the human spirit. It is found at the interrelation between this very specific and restricted use of pneuma and the one that was popular in the world of Paul’s Stoic contemporaries, for whom the fiery divine ‘breath’ indwelt everything and everyone, irrespective of their beliefs or style of life.50 If we ask why Paul would choose such a well-known word and give it a significantly different meaning, we may suspect that the answer would lie in the scriptural explanations that had been given, from the earliest days of the Christian movement, for the strange phenomenon of people finding themselves given new energy, a new sense of direction and above all a strong sense of the personal presence of Jesus, experienced in the way one might expect to experience the presence of the one God himself. Paul seems to have chosen to go on using this potentially confusing word because of these roots, believing that what he and the other followers of Jesus were experiencing was the inauguration of the promised new covenant.51 ([Location 38518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38518))

- Paul’s implicit engagement with the philosophers on the question of ‘physics’ was therefore, unsurprisingly, a variation on the position that might have been taken by some of his Jewish contemporaries. It is, in this respect, not unlike that of the Wisdom of Solomon. There, too, the rulers of the world were to be held to account before the one God. There, too, the ancient story of God’s rescue of his people from Egypt was retold both as foundation myth and as paradigm. Paul had thought through, and was both arguing and living, a specifically Christian variation on this: in Jesus, the rulers had already been judged; the new exodus had already taken place; and a family had been brought into being indwelt by the divine ‘wisdom’ that had been active in creation and in the story of Israel, and that had now come to dwell fully in Jesus and in his spirit-led people. This is how he puts it in Colossians: We are instructing everybody and teaching everybody in every kind of wisdom, so that we can present everybody grown up, complete, in the king … I want their hearts to be encouraged as they’re brought together in love. I want them to experience all the wealth of definite understanding, and to come to the knowledge of God’s mystery – the Messiah, the king! He is the place where you’ll find all the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge.53 ([Location 38537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38537))

- His vision of the cosmos, therefore – his answer to the philosophical debates about ‘physics’ – was characterized through and through by agapē: the outflowing love which led the creator God to make a world in the first place, the radical love which led the Messiah to die and now the uniting love which bound together all those who had embraced the Messiah in faith and hope. This vision of reality led naturally, as did the ‘physics’ of his contemporaries, to the third question: how then should humans behave?

- The difference between Paul’s ethics and those of his philosophical contemporaries can be summed up easily. They believed that once one had discovered and understood (‘logic’) what the world was, how it worked and what human beings actually were (‘physics’), it was the task of humans to live in accordance with that, rather than against its grain (‘ethics’). Paul believed that the world had been renewed in the Messiah; that those who were themselves ‘in the Messiah’ had also been renewed as image-bearing human beings; and that the task of such people was to live in accordance with the new world, rather than against its grain. Since for Paul, as we saw, this renewal did not mean the abolition of the good creation but rather its transformation and fulfilment (that, of course, is part of the meaning of the resurrection), and since the renewal had been inaugurated within the ongoing flow of history rather than arriving complete all at once, there is a natural and considerable overlap between what Paul saw as living in accordance with the new creation and what his contemporaries saw as living in accordance with the world as they knew it. For Paul, the renewal of the existing creation was just as important as the renewal of the existing creation. Without the second, one would be trapped in a world of inevitable entropy. Without the first, the idea of new creation would collapse into some kind of gnosticism.… ([Location 38552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38552))

- This is only the small tip of a large iceberg. Passage after passage in Paul gives evidence of the same frame of reference: the creator God has renewed the world through Jesus, and is renewing you by his spirit, so your bodies in the present must be brought into line with their future resurrected identity – not as an effort after the impossible, but as the making real of the new identity already given in baptism.62 The people who have experienced the new exodus must learn, as the people of the first exodus did not entirely learn, what it means to be both free from Egypt and the dwelling-place of the living God.63 That combination of rescue from slavery and new-temple theology characterizes Paul’s thinking at point after point, providing the strong narrative framework which underlies and gives direction to the general standards on which he insists and the particular commands he addresses to the young churches. Paul has a rich, complex but coherent vision of what has happened in the Messiah, both cosmically (generating a whole new world which now sits uncomfortably alongside the continuing old one) and personally for those who belong to him. That, for instance, is why suffering is so important for Paul: it is the sign that one is indeed living at that dangerous fault-line. At point after point what he says about personal life (‘ethics’) reflects exactly what he says or implies about the cosmos (‘physics’). He knows about both, and so do the young churches, because their understanding has been enlightened by the spirit so that they can see what remains opaque to the rest of the world, and can think clearly and appropriately about it all (‘logic’).

- But the implicit difference between him and his philosophical contemporaries is not that he has a particular lawcode to follow, given by the God of Israel, and they do not. Nor is the difference to be found in any suggestion that Paul believed in a more or less instantaneous conversion while those in the philosophical tradition looked for a steady process of moral transformation. That, actually, represents a point of similarity, as we shall see in a moment. The implicit difference is both in his framing perspective, which as we saw is that of a new-creation eschatology that has been fulfilled in Jesus the Messiah and is now being energized by the divine pneuma, and more specifically in the character which has been glimpsed in Jesus, both in himself and particularly in his dying and rising.65 As I have argued elsewhere, Paul does indeed teach what we may call a virtue ethic. He believes in moral progress, and in the hard work required to make it happen. He has, as it were, taken the classical tradition of ‘virtue’, all the way from Plato and Aristotle to Cicero and beyond, and has reworked it into a Christian key.66 But at the head of his list of virtues he regularly places agapē, the ‘love’ which he has seen revealed in the Messiah. Like other early Christian moralists he adds three other virtues which, like agapē itself, were more or less unknown in the world of paganism: patience, chastity and humility. About these things we do not need here to speak in any detail, except to draw attention to these as striking differences of content, corresponding to the radical differences of framing, between Paul and his pagan philosophical contemporaries.67 ([Location 38621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38621))

- 2. Second, then, the similarities. As we have noted, because for Paul the new creation is the renewal of the existing world, not its abandonment and replacement, there is a good deal of overlap between the behaviour he expects of Jesus’ followers and the behaviour that many pagan moralists would have urged. We noted at the start of the chapter Paul’s positive and encouraging exhortation to think about anything that is true, holy, upright, pure, attractive, of good reputation, virtuous or praiseworthy. True, he balances this with the command to copy him (as opposed to copying the world around) in matters of specific behaviour. But the open invitation to contemplate all that is good or worthwhile in the wider non-Christian environment is a clear hint that we should expect overlap; and this is what we find. He can appeal to general and widely known beliefs of what is ‘good’ or ‘evil’. Christian standards are by no means purely discontinuous with those of everyone else.68 ([Location 38634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38634))

- This, I suggest, is the context within which we should understand the ‘household codes’, lists of guidelines for husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and slaves.74 These are emphatically for a community which is living out an eschatology inaugurated but not yet consummated. Paul treads a fine line (some would say he loses his balance here, and/or that the passages in question thereby demonstrate a non-Pauline authorship) between challenging followers of Jesus to live counter-culturally, being radically different from those around, and merely accommodating to the prevailing cultural mores.75 Paul is well aware of likely charges that might be brought against followers of Jesus: people might well say that they were socially, culturally or politically subversive in ways which were not in fact a reflection of the gospel. He is determined that his communities will order their common lives, not least their family lives, in such a way that the only things people will find to say against them will be to do with their basic allegiance to Jesus.

- Many writers today seem to expect that all morality will be reduced to the liberal ideals of western society in the early years of the twenty-first century, and then to complain that the early Christians ought to have said this more clearly than they seem to have done. This has made it harder for us to understand, let alone to appreciate, Paul’s agenda. ([Location 38659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38659))
- The point seems to be, above all, that he believes in the rehumanizing power of the gospel of Jesus. The gospel is not meant to make people odd or less than fully human; it is meant to renew them in their genuine, image-bearing humanness. We should expect, then, to find that standards emphasized in the finest contemporary philosophers would be echoed by Paul. We can find plenty of shrewd and wise words about drunkenness, sexual misbehaviour, anger and violence, lying and deceit, honesty and hard work in Cicero, Seneca or Epictetus, as well as in Paul. The many parallels here would only be surprising to someone who supposed that Paul derived everything from Torah on the one hand and the teaching of Jesus on the other, ([Location 38667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38667))

- The point is that Paul thinks he has found a way to the genuine humanness which the philosophers have glimpsed but cannot actually attain. One might highlight, for example, his insistence towards the end of Philippians that he has learned how to be autarkēs, ‘content’ in the sense of being self-sufficient. The state of autarkeia was a favourite virtue with Cynics and Stoics as well as (perhaps more obviously) Epicureans. The latter sought that state through retiring from the world and learning to be content, like the gods as they imagined them, in a quiet and happy detachment.78 The Cynics and Stoics sought this same state through training themselves not to need the usual pleasures of life and to make do with whatever circumstances came their way.79 Paul is at this point closer to the Stoics, but again the claim to have arrived at this particular goal is framed in a specifically Christian way: I’m not talking about lacking anything. I’ve learnt to be content [autarkēs] with what I have. I know how to do without, and I know how to cope with plenty. In every possible situation I’ve learned the hidden secret of being full and hungry, of having plenty and going without, and it’s this: I have strength for everything in the one who gives me power.80 Paul is affirming the goal; but he is also claiming that the best way to arrive at it is through following Jesus, hard though that road will be.

- He does not, however, affirm either the Epicurean goal of ataraxia, an untroubled life, or the Stoic/Cynic goal of apatheia, the state in which one no longer feels suffering. Paul has plenty of troubles, and plenty of suffering, and accepts them not only as the natural and necessary concomitant of his calling, and indeed of following the crucified Jesus, but also as the lens through which true knowledge is glimpsed. The philosophers suppose one may come to true knowledge by avoiding suffering; Paul, by embracing it.

- Simply to offer that analysis of the passage would be almost (though not quite) as inadequate as identifying it as part of Paul’s spiritual autobiography and leaving it at that. I do think that there is a sense in which the passage as I have outlined it functions as a kind of autobiography, but not because ‘that’s how it felt at the time’. Philippians 3.4–6, as has often been pointed out, makes it clear that it was not at all how it felt for Paul the ‘zealous’ Jew. Rather, this is a retrospective theological autobiography: this is how Paul, as a man ‘in the Messiah’, now analyzes what in fact was going on, even though at the time he neither felt it like this nor saw it like this.

    - **Tags:** #blue
- The crucial point for the present chapter is that Paul has carefully and deliberately set out his retrospective theological analysis of the plight of the devout Jew under Torah in terms of the well-known dilemma of the pagan moralists. This is, if you like, the negative corollary of the positive point made a moment ago, that when Paul saw what life in the Messiah was really like in terms of renewed humanity it was bound to overlap with what non-Christian moralists had glimpsed as the way to behave. This was entailed by Paul’s belief in creational (and now eschatological) monotheism: if humanity was really being restored in and through Messiah and spirit, one would not expect the result to be out of step at every point with the best that the rest of the human race had seen. So now, as the negative side of the same point, Paul is making it clear, as he does at many points in Romans, that the Jew is also in Adam; that when Torah arrives in Israel, Israel recapitulates the sin which is common to all humankind (5.20; 7.7–12); and that, as a result, the state of Israel under Torah is simply the Jewish version (heightened, made more ironic, sharpened up to the point of great lament) of the plight of an Aristotle complaining of akrasia (and analyzing it microscopically), or an Ovid observing wryly that video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor.86 This is itself, to be sure, part of Paul’s argument about the state of Israel under Torah, but it indicates well enough that Paul is fully aware of the pagan tradition in question, and that his overall argument is designed to deal with that problem as well.

- Second, however, he is indicating by sidelong reference that this new covenant fulfilment of the law by gentiles will be the true fulfilment of the proper aspirations of the pagan moralist. The way Paul has described this strange ‘lawkeeping’ is such as to send echoes out into the world of philosophical moralism, especially that of the Stoics, which spoke of a doing of law ‘by nature’, and of people being ‘a law to themselves’.96 Paul is saying, in effect, Very well: you, the pagan moralist whom I have been addressing since 2.1, may well believe that it is possible for someone like yourself to keep the law ‘by nature’, and to ‘be a law to yourself’. I agree – but the way in which you will accomplish that will be, as I will explain later, through your coming to have the divine law written on your heart. That is the only way you will really be ‘a law to yourself’. ([Location 38777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38777))

- Paul, as well as being a clever writer (Romans reminds us of that on every page), is well aware of the theories, aspirations and expressions of the moral world of first-century paganism. He will not declare this world bankrupt; only impotent. As in chapter 7, with which chapter 2 has some interesting links, he picks up the highest aspirations of the moralist, the ‘unknown gods’ of their ethical worlds, and proposes to announce to them the thing after which they had been ignorantly aspiring. The clear echoes of Stoicism in the present passage, then, are not a sign that Paul has simply scooped up some Stoic language and incorporated it without much reflection into an argument about something else. They are certainly not an indication that he supposes (against the grain of 1.18—3.20 as a whole) that there are actually some pagan moralists out there who, without faith in Jesus or new-covenant membership, really do ‘keep the law’ in such a way as to be ‘justified’.97 The echoes of Stoicism are there because Paul is addressing the pagan moralist in his own terms, almost teasingly. Your ideal of being a law to yourself, he says, is, as it stands, a mirage; but it can become a reality. Follow the Ariadne’s thread of this letter and you’ll find the way out into the light.

- if we imagine Paul posing questions, and alternative interpretations, to the three main categories of pagan philosophy, logic, physics and ethics, he would do so not in a head-on fashion, declaring it all to be worthless, but in the oblique fashion of someone seeing a genuine striving after accuracy and clarity of thought, truth of description of the world, and uprightness of life. With these, Paul has no quarrel. His quarrel is with the fact that the aspiration always fails to meet its goal – and that he believes that the one God, the creator, who has made himself known through Jesus the Messiah, has opened eyes and minds, has unveiled his complex but coherent truth in a way never before imagined and has given a quite new pneuma into the hearts of his people so that, in fulfilling his ancient promises of covenant renewal, he would also fulfil the deepest and highest aspirations of all human hearts. Paul has expressed this belief in a variety of ways, but particularly in those lists of virtues (and they really are ‘virtues’, in the sense that they must be intentionally chosen, practised and perfected in the power of the spirit; they will not ‘happen automatically’,… ([Location 38794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38794))

- Paul’s Jesus-shaped rethinking of the exodus-narrative enables him to radicalize the message of Wisdom, transforming its confrontation into an invitation, its portrait of ‘wisdom’ personified into an actual person and its engagement with the philosophies of its day into a new synthesis. The one God is the creator of heaven and earth, not simply a divine element within everything. Stoic pantheism will not do. But the one God is not far from any one of us, and ‘we are also his offspring’: no room for Epicureanism, then, and meanwhile the highest ‘religious’ aspirations of the Stoic may find a new home.99 One may indeed suppose, with the Academic or the Sceptic, that there isn’t enough evidence to go on; but the one God has called the world to account, as the Psalms and prophets always said he would, through his appointed agent, the Messiah; and of this he has given assurance to all, by raising him from the dead.

- This was Paul’s answer to the philosophies of his day. You could not fit the Jewish worldview into the non-Jewish, let alone the Jewish-but-scandalous message of Jesus into the pagan systems. The danger with announcing that one is going to transcend the Judaism/Hellenism divide is that it sounds like a typical Enlightenment attempt to gain a god’s-eye view from which all differences cease to be noticeable, whereas for Paul the scriptures of Israel, and the God of Israel, could not thus be flattened out. But do it the other way – allow the gospel to state the terms, and let everything else find a home within it – and there will be not only wisdom but also power: Jews look for signs, you see, and Greeks search for wisdom; but we announce the crucified Messiah, a scandal to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks alike, the Messiah – God’s power and God’s wisdom. God’s folly is wiser than humans, you see, and God’s weakness is stronger than humans.101 ([Location 38832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38832))

There might also be serious Sceptics, denying that any certainty was possible about such matters, or others who simply shrugged their shoulders and didn’t bother with hard questions.

- We can nevertheless be reasonably confident that a popular-level Stoicism was widespread in the worlds which Paul visited and to which he wrote. As we saw when looking at characters like Epictetus, the ‘official’ pantheism of the school left plenty of room for people to continue worshipping the gods and praying to them as though they were in some sense ‘other’ than themselves, not simply the ultimate form of the fiery pneuma which pervaded all things and all people. At the popular level, Stoicism provided a conveniently flexible way of viewing the world, giving plenty of good advice on how to behave in a wide variety of situations (first-century Stoics were nothing if not practical) and offering encouragement and fortitude to face the problems and troubles of ordinary life. Seneca himself, Paul’s great contemporary, was among other things a popularizer determined to make the guidance of philosophy available to ordinary people.102 It was in any case harder to be an Epicurean: to do it properly, you had to have the means to escape to your peaceful haven and to live a quiet life without having to work too hard. Stoicism, by contrast, seemed to have something for everybody (though it tended to be the upper classes who studied and tried to practise it). It is fair to assume, therefore, that when Paul was writing to a city like Corinth or Ephesus, and quite possibly the smaller towns as well, he would expect his hearers to be familiar with some of the basic concepts of Stoicism, and to ‘hear’ things that he said within that context – much as today, with western culture still basically Epicurean or at least Deist, people ‘hear’ the word ‘god’ as referring to a distant, detached being, and ‘ethics’ or ‘morality’ as ‘a set of rules designed to stop us having fun’.

- Paul’s ethics, obviously, are a natural place to look.103 His language about the divine pneuma is another obvious place. We may in the end conclude that the main sources for what he says about the spirit are (a) the scriptures and (b) the actual experience of the first Christians, but he must have known that for many of his hearers the word pneuma denoted the ultimately divine identity at the heart of all things, the hot breath that would eventually consume all things.104 When he speaks of the church as the body of the Messiah, he was almost certainly aware that this was an image used by some Stoics to talk about the universal family of humankind, as well as by others to refer to what we still sometimes call the ‘body politic’ of a particular civic community.105 Some have suggested that Paul’s vision of the eschaton, particularly the great scene in Romans 8.18–25, might have been heard on analogy with the Stoic vision of the coming great conflagration, after which all things would start up once more.106 Whether Paul himself would have intended such echoes, granted the… ([Location 38863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38863))
- Some of Paul’s own main themes, of course, cut right across the founding principles of all the main philosophies, Stoicism included. His vision of joy is radically different from the Epicurean vision of pleasure, and his embrace of suffering constitutes a major difference between him and both Epicureanism and Stoicism. His belief in the God of Israel as both radically other than the world and yet intimately involved with it cannot be caught in the categories either of the Porch or of the Garden. And his vision of the ultimate goal of human life is also radically different from theirs, both in its actual content and in the fact that it is not a vision of self-discovery or self-improvement at all. It is, rather, a matter of displacing the ‘self’ from the centre of the picture and placing the Messiah, and his death and resurrection, there instead: … so that my profit may be the Messiah, and that I may be discovered in him, not having my own covenant status defined by Torah, but the status which comes through the Messiah’s faithfulness: the covenant status from God which is given to faith. This means knowing him, knowing the power of his resurrection, and knowing the partnership of his sufferings. It means sharing the form and pattern of his death, so that somehow I may arrive at the final resurrection from the dead.107 ([Location 38875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GP5FO1Y&location=38875))

- Likewise, Paul’s vision of the living presence of the one God, one lord, resulting in him seeing the church and the individual Christian to be ‘temples’ on the shocking analogy with the Jerusalem Temple itself, might be thought to have some analogies with the Stoic doctrine of the indwelling of the pneuma or the logos. But for Paul there are radical differences in both source (the biblical view of God’s tabernacling presence), content (the pneuma as a divine gift, not an automatic human possession) and goal (holiness and unity in the present, resurrection in the future). And the ultimate scandal remained the cross itself. Any self-respecting Greek or Roman with even a smattering of the noble philosophical traditions would be horrified at the idea that the ultimate revelation of the one true God might be the ugly judicial lynching of a young Jew. Any attempt to bring Paul together with his philosophical contemporaries must factor in these stumbling-blocks from the start. Paul was not a first-century moralizing philosopher who happened to hold, on the side as it were, a few strange views about Jesus, and about the meaning and effect of his death and resurrection. These were, for him, the very centre. If we are to compare different schemes of thought with one another we must compare centres with centres, not one person’s centre with another person’s periphery.
