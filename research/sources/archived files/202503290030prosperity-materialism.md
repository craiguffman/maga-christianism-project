# Theological Mutation 6: Prosperity Materialism

## Diagnostic Analysis

### Definition
Prosperity Materialism redefines divine blessing primarily in terms of material wealth, financial success, and social status, transforming Christianity from a faith centered on self-giving love into a spiritual technology for achieving worldly success. It merges Christian symbols with market logic, creating a theological framework that sanctifies wealth acquisition and economic self-interest.

### Key Characteristics
- **Transactional Spirituality**: Portrays relationship with God as exchange of spiritual activities for material rewards
- **Sanctified Self-Interest**: Reframes self-interest as spiritual virtue rather than potential idol
- **Material Hermeneutic**: Interprets biblical promises primarily through material and financial lens
- **Theodicy of Success**: Explains wealth disparities as reflecting spiritual merit rather than systemic factors
- **Sacralized Capitalism**: Identifies market mechanisms with divine will rather than contingent human systems
- **Privatized Ethics**: Focuses on individual financial choices while ignoring structural economic questions
- **Commodified Faith**: Transforms spiritual practices into techniques for worldly advancement

### Manifestations in MAGA Christianism
- Celebrating wealthy leaders as evidence of divine blessing
- Interpreting national prosperity as sign of divine favor
- Promoting "blessed nation" theology that measures divine approval through GDP
- Using spiritual language to justify economic policies benefiting wealthy
- Portraying poverty as primarily spiritual failure rather than systemic issue
- Applying prosperity thinking to national identity and international relations
- Reducing "blessing" language primarily to economic and military metrics

### Theological and Social Consequences
