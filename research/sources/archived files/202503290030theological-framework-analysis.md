# Theological Framework: Comprehensive Analysis of MAGA Christianism's Three Mutations

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive theological analysis of the three mutations identified in MAGA Christianism (primitive biblicism, practical atheism, and binary apocalypticism) and how our theological framework addresses each.

## Core Theological Resources

Our analysis draws primarily from:
- Philip Pettit's concept of freedom as non-domination
- Douglas Campbell's participatory theology and critique of justification theory
- Stanley Hauerwas's critique of Niebuhrian pragmatism
- The historical analysis of Ramist realism

## I. Primitive Biblicism: A Theological Response

Primitive biblicism claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning, bypassing interpretive traditions.

### Non-Domination vs. Hermeneutical Authoritarianism

Pettit's freedom as non-domination provides a hermeneutical principle that challenges primitive biblicism's authoritarian approach to interpretation. When biblicists claim direct access to biblical meaning, they are essentially asserting a form of interpretive domination—positioning themselves as having privileged, unmediated access to divine truth that cannot be questioned.

This creates what could be called "hermeneutical domination," where one interpreter or interpretive community claims absolute authority, allowing them to "arbitrarily interfere" (using Pettit's language) with other interpretations without accountability. A non-domination approach would instead recognize that:

1. All interpretation occurs within communities and traditions
2. No single interpreter has uncontested access to biblical meaning
3. Interpretive authority should be distributed rather than concentrated
4. Accountability and justification are necessary in biblical interpretation

The primitive biblicist's claim to direct access functions precisely as a form of domination that short-circuits meaningful theological dialogue and creates an unaccountable interpretive authority.

### Participatory Hermeneutics vs. Subject-Object Dualism

Campbell's participatory theology directly challenges the subject-object dualism inherent in primitive biblicism. Biblicists approach scripture as an object to be analyzed by an autonomous subject (the interpreter), assuming a neutral vantage point outside the text. Campbell's framework suggests instead that:

1. We interpret scripture as participants within its narrative, not detached observers
2. Understanding comes through engagement in the practices and communities shaped by scripture
3. Interpretation is contextual and relational rather than abstract and universal
4. The goal is transformation through participation rather than extraction of principles

This participatory approach fundamentally undermines the biblicist claim to direct, unmediated access to meaning. The very act of reading scripture is already mediated through language, tradition, and community.

### Ramist Realism as Genealogical Predecessor

Our analysis of Ramist realism provides a crucial genealogical argument, showing how primitive biblicism emerges from a specific intellectual tradition rather than being a "natural" or "pure" reading of scripture. By identifying the defining characteristics of Ramist realism (direct access to biblical meaning, definition and division as primary method, extraction of universal axioms, reduction to binary distinctions), we demonstrate that what presents itself as "just reading the Bible" is actually a sophisticated philosophical approach with specific historical roots.

This genealogical argument is powerful because it:

1. Historicizes what claims to be timeless
2. Reveals the contingent nature of interpretive methods that claim universality 
3. Shows that primitive biblicism itself emerges from a tradition despite its anti-traditional claims
4. Exposes the philosophical assumptions underlying seemingly "straightforward" readings

## II. Practical Atheism: A Theological Response

Practical atheism, drawing from Niebuhr's approach, removes Jesus as exemplar and replaces him with pragmatic politics disconnected from Christ's example.

### Freedom as Non-Domination vs. Political Pragmatism

Pettit's concept of freedom as non-domination provides a standard for evaluating political pragmatism. When MAGA Christianism adopts a pragmatic approach to politics that prioritizes effectiveness over faithfulness to Christ's example, it essentially embraces a form of practical atheism where:

1. Political success becomes the measure of truth rather than conformity to Christ
2. Pragmatic effectiveness justifies means that may contradict Christian ethics
3. Power becomes the organizing principle rather than love or justice
4. The church functions as a political constituency rather than an alternative community

Our application of Pettit's framework allows us to argue that true Christian freedom isn't mere pragmatic effectiveness but freedom from domination—both the freedom Christ offers from sin and death, and the freedom Christians should seek for all people from systems of oppression.

**Trinitarian Enrichment**: The question "Does it reduce domination?" ultimately and more creatively amounts to "Does it edify our fellowship with God, the created order, and especially my near and distant neighbors, given the Trinity's revelation that such fellowship constitutes authentic humanity?" This connects our project to Christian humanism and grounds freedom as non-domination in the very nature of God revealed in the Trinity—where divine persons exist in perfect fellowship without domination or subordination.

This trinitarian framing:
1. Grounds freedom as non-domination in the nature of God
2. Expands the scope beyond political relationships
3. Defines authentic humanity in terms of fellowship rather than autonomous choice
4. Transforms Pettit's somewhat negative formulation into a positive vision

### Christ as Supreme Exemplar vs. Religious Window-Dressing

Campbell's emphasis on Christ as exemplar directly challenges the practical atheism of MAGA Christianism. Following Hauerwas's critique of Niebuhr, we can demonstrate how MAGA Christianism functionally removes Jesus as the pattern for Christian life:

1. Jesus becomes a symbol of national identity rather than the pattern for discipleship
2. Christian rhetoric provides window-dressing for policies that may contradict Christ's teaching
3. The cross is transformed from a pattern of self-giving love to a cultural symbol of power
4. Salvation is privatized and individualized, disconnected from ethical transformation

Campbell's participatory framework insists that Christ is not merely a savior who justifies but an exemplar who transforms. This directly contradicts the practical atheism that functionally removes Jesus as the pattern for Christian political engagement.

### Theological Integrity vs. Accommodated Christianity

Hauerwas's critique of Niebuhr as a form of accommodated Christianity provides a powerful framework for analyzing MAGA Christianism's practical atheism. Just as Niebuhr "sought to make Christian belief intelligible within the naturalistic presumptions that he thought were a prerequisite of modern science," MAGA Christianism makes Christian belief "intelligible and even useful within the presuppositions of" right-wing politics.

This leads to theological distortions where:

1. Christian convictions become unintelligible when divorced from the practices and communities that sustain them
2. Success is judged by secular metrics of political influence rather than faithfulness to Christ
3. Christian language becomes a tool for political mobilization rather than formation in Christ
4. The church becomes a subset of political community rather than an alternative political reality

## III. Binary Apocalypticism: A Theological Response

Binary apocalypticism divides the world into good and evil, friends and enemies, saved and damned.

### Freedom as Non-Domination vs. Friend/Enemy Distinction

Pettit's concept of freedom as non-domination directly challenges the Schmittian friend/enemy distinction that underlies binary apocalypticism. Carl Schmitt's political theology, which defines the political through the friend/enemy distinction, creates a framework where:

1. Politics is fundamentally about identifying and opposing enemies
2. Victory over enemies rather than building common good becomes the goal
3. Compromise represents weakness rather than virtue
4. The political becomes a secularized version of apocalyptic struggle

Our application of Pettit's framework allows us to argue that Christian political engagement should be oriented toward reducing domination for all rather than securing dominance for one's friends against enemies. This provides a theological alternative to binary thinking that:

1. Seeks freedom as non-domination for all, including political opponents
2. Prioritizes building common institutions that check arbitrary power
3. Recognizes that systems that secure dominance for some necessarily create domination for others
4. Refuses the reduction of politics to apocalyptic struggle

### Participatory Salvation vs. Contractual Justification

Campbell's critique of contractual justification theory provides a powerful theological response to binary apocalypticism. The contractual model of salvation, which emphasizes God's justice satisfied through Christ's punishment, easily maps onto political frameworks that:

1. Divide the world into the saved and the damned
2. Emphasize judgment and punishment over reconciliation
3. Focus on individual salvation rather than communal reconciliation
4. See salvation as a transaction rather than transformation

Campbell's participatory alternative emphasizes that:

1. Salvation comes through participation in Christ, not mere contractual exchange
2. The problem is not merely guilt requiring punishment but death and alienation requiring new life
3. Resurrection rather than mere atonement is the center of Christian hope
4. The goal is reconciliation of all things, not separation of saved from damned

This participatory framework fundamentally challenges the binary thinking of apocalypticism by emphasizing God's universal reconciling work in Christ rather than division and judgment.

### Eschatological Hope vs. Political Fear

Binary apocalypticism operates through a politics of fear rather than hope. Drawing on theological resources from von Balthasar and others, we can contrast this fear-based politics with authentic Christian eschatology:

1. Christian hope is grounded in God's universal reconciling purpose, not fear of enemies
2. The church witnesses to this hope through practices of reconciliation, not political victory
3. Christian eschatology looks toward universal restoration, not eternal division
4. Love casts out fear rather than weaponizing it for political mobilization

This eschatological perspective provides a powerful theological alternative to the binary thinking of apocalypticism, offering a vision of reconciliation that transcends political divisions.

## IV. Integration: A Unified Theological Response

While these three mutations appear distinct, our theological framework reveals their interconnection:

1. **Primitive biblicism** provides the interpretive method that enables cherry-picking texts to support binary thinking and pragmatic politics
2. **Practical atheism** disconnects Christian practice from Christ's example, enabling political pragmatism to override Christian ethics
3. **Binary apocalypticism** creates the framework of fear and emergency that justifies pragmatic compromises

Our framework allows us to address not just the symptoms but the underlying theological distortions:

1. **Freedom as non-domination** provides an alternative political theology grounded in Christ's liberating work
2. **Participatory salvation** offers a theological vision centered on reconciliation rather than division
3. **Christ as exemplar** reconnects Christian ethics to the pattern of Christ's life

By addressing these core theological issues, we provide not merely a political critique but a comprehensive theological alternative—one that maintains the prophetic edge of Christianity without falling into the distortions of MAGA Christianism.

## V. Connection to Christian Humanism

The trinitarian enrichment of freedom as non-domination creates a profound connection to Christian humanism that strengthens our theological critique. This connection is especially potent because it:

1. Recovers a rich theological tradition that predates current political divisions
2. Offers a vision of human flourishing rooted in relationship rather than domination
3. Provides resources for addressing contemporary challenges without being captive to either progressive or conservative political frameworks
4. Demonstrates how theological anthropology shapes political engagement

By connecting our critique to this robust tradition of Christian humanism, we show that our response to MAGA Christianism isn't merely reactive but emerges from the deep wellsprings of Christian theological reflection on what constitutes authentic human flourishing in light of the Trinity.
