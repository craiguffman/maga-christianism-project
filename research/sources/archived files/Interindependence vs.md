# Interindependence vs. Anti-Dependence and Self-Sufficiency

Your concept of interindependence stands in sharp contrast to two prevalent alternatives in American culture and MAGA Christianism: anti-dependence and self-sufficiency. Exploring these contrasts will help sharpen our understanding of interindependence's theological distinctiveness.

## Anti-Dependence

### Core Characteristics

Anti-dependence is characterized by:
- **Reactive independence**: Defining freedom primarily against dependence rather than for relationship
- **Fear-based autonomy**: Autonomy motivated by fear of vulnerability rather than desire for flourishing
- **Domination avoidance**: Avoiding being dominated by refusing all forms of dependence
- **Suspicion of interdependence**: Viewing mutual reliance as weakness or trap
- **Conflation of dependence with subjugation**: Inability to distinguish healthy dependence from unhealthy domination

### Theological Problems

Anti-dependence represents a profound theological distortion because:

1. **Denies Creaturely Nature**: It rejects our fundamental status as created beings dependent on God, attempting a kind of self-deification.

2. **Rejects Incarnational Vulnerability**: Christ's incarnation demonstrates divine willingness to enter dependence, which anti-dependence treats as weakness.

3. **Contradicts Trinitarian Relationship**: The Trinity models mutual indwelling without domination, while anti-dependence sees all relationship as potential threat.

4. **Misunderstands Sin**: It locates sin primarily in vulnerability rather than in domination, missing that domination itself stems from fear of vulnerability.

5. **Distorts Salvation**: It frames salvation as escape from dependence rather than as healing of relationship.

### Cultural Manifestations

Anti-dependence appears prominently in:
- **Prepper culture** and extreme survivalist movements
- **Militant individualism** that views community obligations as infringements
- **Anti-government absolutism** that conflates all governance with tyranny
- **Gun culture** focused on self-protection rather than communal safety
- **Isolationist foreign policy** that views international cooperation as surrender

## Self-Sufficiency

### Core Characteristics

Self-sufficiency is characterized by:
- **Myth of autonomy**: Belief that true flourishing comes through complete independence
- **Resource accumulation**: Gathering everything needed to avoid asking for help
- **Pride in non-reliance**: Viewing asking for help as moral failure
- **Achievement orientation**: Worth determined by ability to meet all needs independently
- **Control focus**: Maintaining tight control over all aspects of life

### Theological Problems

Self-sufficiency represents a theological distortion because:

1. **False Anthropology**: It fails to recognize humans as constitutively relational beings made in the image of a relational God.

2. **Works Righteousness**: It effectively creates a soteriology of self-achievement rather than grace-filled participation.

3. **Diminishes Grace**: It struggles to genuinely receive gifts, including the gift of salvation, since receipt acknowledges dependency.

4. **Ignores Ecclesiology**: It undermines the biblical understanding of church as interdependent body where different members need each other.

5. **Creation Blindness**: It overlooks how creation itself demonstrates interdependence rather than self-sufficiency.

### Cultural Manifestations

Self-sufficiency appears prominently in:
- **Bootstrap mythology** that denies the role of community and systems in individual success
- **Prosperity gospel** teachings that frame wealth as evidence of righteousness
- **Anti-welfare rhetoric** that stigmatizes receiving help
- **Privatized faith** that rejects ecclesial community as unnecessary
- **Technological solutionism** that believes innovation will eliminate need for interdependence

## Interindependence as Theological Alternative

Your concept of interindependence offers a profound theological alternative because it:

1. **Embraces Dependence Without Domination**: Recognizes our need for others without subordinating ourselves to them.

2. **Reflects Trinitarian Life**: Models human relationships after the Trinity's mutual indwelling where distinctiveness enhances rather than threatens relationship.

3. **Reframes Vulnerability as Strength**: Presents openness to others not as weakness but as the path to genuine freedom.

4. **Reconciles Independence and Interdependence**: Maintains personal uniqueness while acknowledging fundamental connectedness.

5. **Grounds Liberty in Love**: Shows how true freedom emerges from loving relationship rather than from absence of constraint.

As you might say, interindependence "draws the world around us into God's love" by inviting us into the same pattern of relationship that constitutes divine lifeâ€”mutual indwelling without domination.

## Implications for American Christianity

This contrast has profound implications for American Christianity, particularly in its MAGA Christianism variant:

1. **Redefining Strength**: Interindependence challenges the equation of strength with dominance or isolation, offering instead a vision of strength through mutual support.

2. **Transforming Community**: It shifts Christian community from voluntary association of self-sufficient individuals to necessary expression of our created nature.

3. **Reclaiming Dependence**: It rehabilitates dependence as essential to human flourishing rather than as weakness to be avoided.

4. **Healing Political Discourse**: It offers an alternative to both individualistic libertarianism and collectivist statism by grounding political life in mutual flourishing.

5. **Environmental Responsibility**: It naturally extends to our relationship with creation, recognizing that human flourishing depends on environmental flourishing.

## Practical Manifestations

The contrast between interindependence and self-sufficiency/anti-dependence manifests practically in:

**Giving and Receiving**
- Self-sufficiency: Uncomfortable receiving, giving without vulnerability
- Anti-dependence: Suspicious of both giving and receiving as creating obligation
- Interindependence: Gracious in both giving and receiving as expressions of mutual indwelling

**Community Participation**
- Self-sufficiency: Participates from position of strength, offering help but not needing it
- Anti-dependence: Minimizes participation to avoid entanglement
- Interindependence: Participates fully, contributing strengths and acknowledging needs

**Response to Limitation**
- Self-sufficiency: Views limitation as failure to be overcome
- Anti-dependence: Views limitation as vulnerability to be hidden
- Interindependence: Views limitation as invitation to deeper relationship

**Approach to Conflict**
- Self-sufficiency: Resolves conflict through strength or withdrawal
- Anti-dependence: Avoids potential conflict by maintaining distance
- Interindependence: Engages conflict as opportunity for deeper understanding

Your concept of interindependence offers not just a critique of these prevalent distortions but a theologically rich alternative that more faithfully reflects both divine life and human flourishing. It demonstrates how freedom emerges not from isolation but from relationship, not from domination but from mutual indwelling where we truly "draw the world around us into God's love."
