# Synthesis Notes: Christian Political Witness in a MAGA Era

## Core Insights from Bretherton for "From First Principles: A Theological Critique of MAGA Christianism"

Luke Bretherton's work on Christianity and contemporary politics provides several crucial frameworks for critiquing MAGA Christianism while developing a constructive theological politics. His insights on hospitality, political judgment, and the proper relationship between church and state are particularly relevant to our project.

### The Church in "Babylon": An Augustinian Framework

Bretherton's Augustinian framework helps us understand the church's mission in a post-Christendom context. When he references Jeremiah 29, we find a model for faithful witness within Babylon:

> "When the prophet Jeremiah foretold the captivity which was to befall the ancient People of God, he bade them, by divine command, to go obediently into Babylon, thereby serving God even by their patient endurance, and he himself admonished them to pray for Babylon, saying 'in the peace thereof shall ye have peace': the temporal peace which is for the time being shared by the good and the wicked alike."

This directly addresses our project's concern with how Christians should navigate the tension between religious particularity and civic responsibility in a pluralistic democracy. Rather than the triumphalism of MAGA Christianism, Bretherton suggests an approach where Christians:

1. Remain engaged in civic life as *resident aliens*
2. Seek the welfare of the broader society
3. Maintain faithful particularity and obedience to God
4. Reject both escapism and assimilation

This resonates with our book's Introduction, where we position our critique of MAGA Christianism between withdrawal and accommodation.

### Three Mutations: Co-option, Competition, and Commodification

Bretherton identifies three problematic responses of churches to contemporary politics that align remarkably well with our project's theological analysis of MAGA Christianism:

1. **Co-option**: "Some respond by letting the church be construed by the modern bureaucratic state as either one more interest group seeking a share of public money or just another constituency within civil society which can foster social cohesion and make up the deficiencies of the welfare state."

2. **Competition**: "Another response is for Christians to construe themselves as part of an identity politics. This entails reframing Christian political witness in terms of either multiculturalism – the church becoming just another minority identity group demanding recognition for its way of life as equally valid in relation to all others – or the rhetoric of rights the church decomposing itself into a collective of rights – bearing individuals pursuing freedom of religious expression."

3. **Commodification**: "A third response is to let Christianity be construed by the market as a product to be consumed or commodity to be bought and sold so that in the religious marketplace Christianity is simply another privatized lifestyle choice, interchangeable with or equivalent to any other."

MAGA Christianism exemplifies all three mutations. It has allowed Christianity to be co-opted by partisan interests, has reduced faith to a means of preserving white Christian cultural power, and has commodified religious symbols into political merchandise. Our theological critique needs to address all three dynamics.

### Hospitality as an Alternative to MAGA's Binary Politics

One of Bretherton's most valuable contributions is his concept of hospitality as a political practice, which contrasts sharply with MAGA Christianism's friend/enemy distinction:

> "Hospitality refuses the political fantasy of neutral ground on which all may meet as equals."

Instead of either liberal neutrality or nationalist exclusion, Bretherton proposes Christian hospitality as creating "tent-like places" where difference is neither erased nor treated as an impenetrable barrier:

> "The practice of hospitality, as conceptualized here, recognizes tent-like places to subsist off the prior life and work of temples. At the same time, the practice of hospitality ensures a relationship between temples and tent-like places so that the temples themselves do not congeal and ossify into domains of oppression, closed off from God and neighbor."

This offers a constructive alternative to MAGA Christianism's tribalism and binary thinking, directly addressing our book's third section on "Binary Apocalypticism."

### Christian Cosmopolitanism vs. Nationalist Christianity

Bretherton's "Christian cosmopolitanism" provides an alternative to both MAGA nationalism and abstract liberal universalism:

> "Within a Christian cosmopolitan framework, the telos of humanity is neither a return to an original state of blessing nor a movement beyond the materiality of creation. Rather, it is a movement, via differentiation and development through history, to an eschatological fulfillment of creation."

This vision offers a more theologically rich understanding of national identity than MAGA Christianism's conflation of American identity with Christian identity. It suggests that:

> "A properly theological cosmopolitanism must incorporate the fulfillment of humanity via differentiation into particular sodalities of persons that involve differences of language, kinship, and territoriality and a myriad of other aspects of creation. For without discrete identities that take up and play with creation in particular ways through history there can be no interplay of persons in communion."

This directly counters MAGA Christianism's idolatrous nationalism while still affirming the legitimate value of particular identities, traditions, and communities.

### Politics and the Common Good

Bretherton's understanding of politics as "the ongoing process through which to maintain commonality and recognize and conciliate conflict (including the use of coercive force) in pursuit of shared, temporal goods" offers a stark contrast to MAGA Christianism's pursuit of cultural dominance.

His concept of "goods in common" is particularly valuable: 

> "By goods in common I do not mean the aggregation of different vested interests, but substantive goods in which the flourishing of all is invested. Such substantive goods, for example, health or education, are goods in which the good of each is conditional upon the good of all."

This aligns with our book's emphasis on the "primitive biblicism" of MAGA Christianism, which reduces complex moral and political questions to simplistic readings of scripture that ignore the role of prudential judgment in determining how to pursue common goods in particular contexts.

### The Postsecular Context and Multiple Modernities

Bretherton's characterization of our era is profoundly insightful:

> "The contemporary context may be described as a postsecularist space as far as the state and certain elite groups are concerned, but it is better understood overall as a period in which, for the first time, multiple modernities, each with their respective relationship to religious belief and practice, are overlapping and interacting within the same shared, predominantly urban spaces. Within such interactions, existing binary oppositions, such as secular and religious, tolerant and intolerant, public and private, conservative and radical, and left and right, that tend to frame political relationships break down. Yet incommensurable otherness remains to be negotiated within a shared territory in pursuit of goods in common."

This analysis helps clarify why MAGA Christianism's nostalgic vision of a homogeneous Christian America is both historically inaccurate and ethically problematic. It also explains why traditional political categories often fail to capture the new cultural-religious realignments we're witnessing.

### Hallowing Bare Life: A Response to Dehumanization

Bretherton's concept of "hallowing bare life" provides a powerful theological response to the dehumanizing rhetoric of MAGA Christianism toward immigrants, refugees, and other marginalized groups:

> "To hallow the name of God involves us in standing against that which desecrates God's holy name. The rendering of creatures as bare life constitutes just such a desecration."

> "To hallow something means recognizing the irreducible worth of what is before one."

This concept of hallowing bare life could be instrumental in our chapter on "Fear of the Other vs. Love of Neighbor," demonstrating how Christian witness should counter rather than reinforce the politics of dehumanization.

## Constructive Elements for Our Project

Drawing from Bretherton, I suggest the following constructive elements for our theological critique of MAGA Christianism:

1. **Recovering Augustinian Realism**: Augustine's understanding of the saeculum as "ambiguous, undetermined time" provides a framework for faithful political witness that avoids both the triumphalism and the despair that characterize much of MAGA Christianism.

2. **Practicing Theological Listening**: Bretherton's emphasis on listening as the "constitutive political act" of the church offers a direct counter to MAGA Christianism's culture war approach.

3. **Developing Post-Liberal Politics within Liberal Constitutional Order**: This nuanced approach allows us to affirm the legitimate criticisms MAGA Christianism makes of liberal excesses while rejecting its authoritarian alternatives.

4. **Reimagining Cosmopolitan Patriotism**: Christian cosmopolitanism allows us to value particular identities and traditions while placing them within an eschatological horizon that prevents idolatry.

5. **Cultivating Practices of Hospitality**: These practices allow us to uphold human dignity across lines of difference without either erasing particularity or treating difference as an absolute barrier.

These elements provide theological resources for a form of Christian political witness that is neither accommodationist nor separatist, but rather seeks the welfare of Babylon while maintaining faithful witness to God's coming kingdom.
