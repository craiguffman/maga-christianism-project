### Highlights

- The Jews were the most modern, the most artistic, the most literate, and the most political group in Germany, and everything they did crossed a line for conservative Protestants. Germany had had little experience of democracy, and the Jews had been one of the most democratic groups in Germany, whereas conservative groups in Germany would have preferred a return to the old empire with the “Kaiser” and the Catholic Württembergers and the Bavarians pined for their princely houses.

- The Jews had finally obtained equal rights in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933). Jews were among the leading figures in the Social Democrats and Communist parties. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=131))
- The properly asked question is more important than any explanation or other display of wisdom. This is what makes astute people. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=134))

- Then news came that all students who would be found in my father’s presence would be sent off to the concentration camps, and the Confessing Church Council decided to put a stop to the work. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=143))
- a primary longing for ideal community, populated with ideal persons. That is what white supremacy ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=216))
- set in place by concepts of human difference meant to legitimize buying and selling African people; Jews were racialized, and race as a biological ideology of human difference is dependent upon key modern developments that include the Triangle Trade.

- That Atlantic space is discursive: it is not only the physical location where people of African descent were fractured into a myriad of cultures around the world, all subject to whites-only power; it is also the catalytic moment of discussion about their bodies. It is a place of death, physically and epistemologically. It also serves as a place of reimagining. It is as religious as it is anything else, which is why this book is nearly as much about the Black Church as it is about Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He entered Harlem, and thus, a new awareness about faith and social life, together, through that discursive Black Atlantic way. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=220))
- a tradition of Jesus that connected the dissonant strands of grief and hope in the experience of black people who trusted in God to make a way out of no way. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=243))
- “I am a Christian,” she protested, “and since Jesus is white, I don’t have to answer to anyone who is not white.” ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=251))
- connection between interpretations of Jesus and social expectations within communities of worship, and my interest in the way our understanding of Jesus shapes the moral lives of Christians grew. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=255))

- That understanding and relationship developed from his year of study in New York City when he encountered the black Christ who suffered with African Americans in a white supremacist world. He took that identity of the black Christ with him when he returned to Nazi Germany. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=306))

- First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

- The Christianity of the Harlem Renaissance was a theological manifestation, post–Civil War, pre–civil rights movement, that identified Jesus with the oppressed rather than with the oppressors, in a critical interrogation of the notions of God and humanity embedded within the modern imperialist union of race and religion.

- Bonhoeffer identified lethal problems within their Christianity. Like American prosegregation Christians, the pro-Nazi German Christians demonstrated in a negative way that the mere claim to be a Christian is not an indication of faithful discipleship; what matters is one’s interpretation of Christlikeness, how one interprets the way of Jesus.

- uncouple the false connection between white imperialist identity and Jesus and its tragic imprint for Christianity. That struggle would last Bonhoeffer the rest of his life. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=338))
- Bonhoeffer’s experience in Harlem demonstrates that a Christian interpretation of the way of Jesus must be connected to justice for a Christian to see beyond primary loyalties to self and kind, to recognize the needs for justice in another’s context, and to “love neighbor as self.” ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=343))
- give priority to the intrinsically vulnerable, fluid, and relational character of the gospel over and against the analytical, evaluative, and domineering Christianity of empire and colony. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=345))
- Abusive empathy is prone to projection, in which the dominant, self-determining, autonomous persons within the social hierarchy bounce their image off the fungible body of fixed, commodified human subjects, only to see their own reflection returned to them. Empathy can be distorted to make it another way of keeping the subject in subjection, requiring an imagined white body overlaying a black one to humanize it.4 Abusive empathy is that of a perceived superior, autonomous social identity imagining itself again by projecting itself against an inferior, dependent subject.

- Christ is the vicarious representative before God, the empathic representative who becomes a model of Christian discipleship by demonstrating the interaction that Christians are to have with one another. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=367))
- He became aware of the way that Western Christianity is calibrated to a harmful ideal by a false connection between imperialism and Christianity. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=375))
- Harlem gave Bonhoeffer a healthier encounter with Jesus by way of a connection between Jesus and suffering within an ethic of resistance that identifies Jesus with the oppressed, rather than the oppressors. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=376))
- His commitment to embrace Christ left him with no other choice in a society where indifference replaced concern for the cries for help from the margins. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=385))
- the Bonhoeffers were not a church-going family. They knew the Christianity of the German cultured upper class, with its music, poetry, literature and hymnody, and Bible. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=422))
- Seeberg helped Bonhoeffer to see Jesus as the initiator of a new humanity that identified Christ with the community of the church in the world, as the location where the Holy Spirit becomes flesh. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=444))
- Bonhoeffer harmonized Barth’s insistence on the otherness of God with his Berlin professor’s historically concrete, modern German theology to develop a theology of sociality that emphasized the revelation of God in the world, in the person of Jesus. For Bonhoeffer, Christ is present in the world as the church, in the communion of saints, in the community of believers. Christ existing as the church is empathic, vicarious representative action, or Jesus as Stellvertretung, who became Kollektivperson, or humanity combined in one, by standing in for all of humanity in the sin and shame that makes us hide and isolate ourselves from God and one another. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=452))
- Bonhoeffer remained sympathetic toward the German nationalism that was popular within the general mind-set of post–World War I Germany. His nationalist sympathies produced contradictions in his innovative theology at the early stages of its development. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=459))
- In daily life, the two-kingdom split meant that Christian piety was a matter for one’s private life, but in public the laws of the state guided Christians. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=462))
- overt contradictions in his developing theology, beginning with the dissonance between nationalism and ecumenism. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=469))
- Walzer describes what he calls a moral minimalism, the “reiterated features of our thick maximal moralities.” A thick maximal morality is what we learn in our formative community, where we know the language of injustice and well-being in a particular way. Moral minimalism is the thin language of our public discourse that provides a minimal account of our particular, complex, fully developed maximal morality. Minimalism, unlike impartial reason, is not a claim to abstract or absolute universals; it is a cross-cultural language that remains intimately bound to the history and formation of its particular community. ([Location 3121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=3121))
- more realistic ethical discourse about universals provides us with the means of reflecting on empathic experiences, moves from the particular to the universal, and corrects the misleading—universal to particular—approach of impartial reasoning. ([Location 3126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=3126))
- reiterates features of morality formed within the shared life of a community in a way that other communities can understand. ([Location 3128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09FCCJ9Y7&location=3128))
