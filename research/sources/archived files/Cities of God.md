### Highlights

- The term sect is a concept. It refers exclusively to religious organizations in a high state of tension with their surrounding society. As a proper scientific concept it is abstract; it exists only in our minds. We can’t observe the concept of sect. What we can observe are concrete instances of this concept: actual groups of people who fit the definition. It is essential to keep in mind that, because sect is an abstract concept, it is only a name. To correctly identify some group as a sect does not explain anything about it. It doesn’t tell us, for example, why this sect provokes hostility among outsiders. To say it does so because it is a sect is circular nonsense—true by definition.
