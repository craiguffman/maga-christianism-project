2. **Theological Epistemology**
   - Participatory knowing vs. Contractual understanding

## Methodological Commitments
1. Christ-centered interpretation
2. Rejection of individualistic theological frameworks
3. Emphasis on transformative encounter over doctrinal compliance
4. Recognition of theological methods as cultural technologies

## Research Trajectory
- Expose how theological methods produce cultural formations
- Demonstrate the genealogy of religious imagination
