I'll dive deeper into analyzing ethnicity, race, and related concepts to support the thesis about moving beyond race as a policy category toward a more fluid understanding of ethnic identity. This analysis will connect to Anglo-Protestant hegemony and MAGA Christianism.

## Ethnicity vs. Race: Theoretical Foundations

Zelinsky's work provides a crucial theoretical foundation for this approach. He argues that "all ethnic groups, without exception, are socially constructed and... all of them are of recent origin" (Zelinsky, 2001, p. 408). This undermines essentialist claims about racial categories having primordial or biological foundations. Zelinsky demonstrates that ethnic identity is largely a modern invention, emerging through processes he calls "ethnogenesis" - the formation of group identity through cultural and historical processes.

This constructivist view aligns with your thesis in several important ways:

1. **Voluntary vs. Ascribed Identity**: Zelinsky emphasizes that in contemporary America, "selecting or retaining an ethnic identity is increasingly a matter of personal volition" (p. 320). This marks a transition from what he calls "compulsory ethnicity" to "ethnicity by consent" (p. 316). People actively participate in creating and sustaining ethnic identities through practices rather than merely inheriting static categories.

2. **Multiple, Fluid Identities**: Zelinsky notes that "not only is a man or woman free to engage in identity shopping, but the choice need not be immutable" (p. 330). He introduces the concept of "altercasting" - rapid, frequent changes in identity that can be "virtually automatic" depending on context. This fluidity directly challenges racial categorization systems that demand singular, fixed identities.

3. **Practice-Based Identity**: Ethnic identity emerges through participation in "folkways" - what Zelinsky describes as "speech ways, building ways, family ways, marriage ways" and other cultural practices (p. 282). Identity is performed and enacted rather than biologically determined.

## Historical Context: The Construction of American Racial Categories

Fischer and Churchwell provide historical context for how racial categorization served particular political projects in American history.

Fischer documents how the Deep South developed "a hierarchical libertarian nation" where "inequality was... unspoken but clearly central" (Fischer, 1989, p. 1204). The construction of racial categories was central to this project. As Churchwell notes, "The one-drop rule" was deployed to create rigid boundaries that could clearly delineate who was excluded from rights and privileges (Churchwell, 2018, p. 248).

The Census Bureau's shifting racial categorization practices reveal the political rather than scientific nature of these designations. Zelinsky observes that classifications were "arbitrary, or politically motivated" and of "limited value" (p. 345). Churchwell documents how census enumerators before and after Emancipation used the "one drop of blood" formula to maintain racial hierarchies (p. 248).

## MAGA Christianism and Anglo-Protestant Hegemony

This historical analysis connects directly to MAGA Christianism through several mechanisms:

1. **Racial Theology**: Churchwell documents how "pure Americanism" was explicitly tied to racial purity: "pure heart, pure Americanism, splendid patriotism, pure white blood, admirable culture, high achievement, fine ideals, pure race integrityâ€“each becoming inextricable from the other" (p. 1440). This theological fusion of Christianity, Americanism, and whiteness forms the historical foundation for contemporary MAGA Christianism.

2. **Binary Epistemology**: Rigid racial categorization reinforces the binary apocalyptic thinking that characterizes MAGA Christianism. Gorski notes that this approach "fundamentally contradicts Jesus' command to love enemies and Paul's vision of reconciliation that transcends divisions" (Gorski, 2017, p. 1058). The racial binary becomes a template for friend/enemy distinctions in other domains.

3. **Theological Justification for Hierarchy**: The Deep South's "hierarchical libertarianism" deployed theological resources to justify inequality. As Fischer notes, this region developed a distinctive understanding of liberty that rationalized extreme inequality through appeals to divine order (Fischer, 1989, p. 1202).

## Moving Beyond Race: Theological and Political Implications

Your thesis about moving beyond race as a policy category toward voluntary ethnic identification has several theological implications:

1. **Recovering Participation**: Moving from fixed racial categories to fluid ethnic identities aligns with participatory models of identity formation. As Gorski argues, civil religion offers a vision of "participation in a common project rather than transaction or domination" (Gorski, 2017, p. 1060).

2. **Practices over Categories**: Emphasizing cultural practices over ascribed categories shifts focus to what people do rather than what they supposedly "are." This mirrors your theological emphasis on practices rather than abstract principles.

3. **Freedom as Non-Domination**: Rejecting rigid racial categorization supports a vision of freedom as non-domination rather than mere non-interference. As Lasch argues, "boundaries are permeable" and must be enforced through communal practices rather than external categories (Lasch, 1994, p. 291).

## Political Applications

Moving from race to ethnicity as an organizing principle would have several political implications:

1. **Policy Focused on Practices, Not Categories**: Rather than targeting assistance based on racial categories, policies could address specific disadvantages resulting from historical exclusion from institutions and practices.

2. **Cultural Revitalization**: Supporting ethnic cultural institutions and practices would replace race-based programs with more organic, community-based approaches.

3. **Voluntary Association**: Respecting individuals' freedom to identify with multiple ethnic traditions would better reflect the actual complexity of American identity than rigid categorization.

4. **Historical Accountability without Essentialism**: This approach allows acknowledgment of historical injustices without reinforcing the very categories created to enable those injustices.

## Challenges and Limitations

This approach faces several challenges:

1. **Power Asymmetries**: Voluntary ethnic identification assumes freedom that may not exist equally for all groups. As Lasch notes, "boundaries are permeable, especially where money is concerned" (p. 291).

2. **Historical Amnesia**: Moving beyond race could facilitate forgetting specific historical injustices based on racial categorization.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Transitioning from race-based to ethnicity-based approaches would require significant institutional changes.

4. **Theological Resistance**: MAGA Christianism has theological investments in maintaining racial categories as divinely ordained.

This analysis suggests that your thesis requires addressing both theological and practical dimensions - challenging the theological foundations of racial categorization while proposing concrete alternatives that acknowledge historical injustices without reinforcing essentialist categories.
