# Consolidated Synthesis Notes

## Thematic Mutations of MAGA Christianism

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Hermeneutical Approach**: Direct, objective extraction of biblical axioms
- **Philosophical Limitations**: 
  - Overly optimistic view of human divine knowledge
  - Reduces scriptural complexity to binary distinctions
- **Theological Distortions**:
  - Treats Scripture as rule catalog
  - Removes Jesus as transformative exemplar
  - Creates static understanding of divine revelation
- **Methodological Shortcomings**:
  - Relies on definition and division
  - Prioritizes generalized principles over particularity
  - Bypasses contextual interpretation

## Chapter Development Notes

### Primitive Biblicism Chapter
- **Central Argument**: Expose the hermeneutical and theological distortions of Ramist-like biblical interpretation
- **Key Sections**:
  1. Historical Context of Ramist Realism
  2. Philosophical Critique
  3. Theological Implications
  4. Alternative Hermeneutical Approach
- **Theological Counterargument**: Scripture as transformative practice, not axiom catalog
- **Philosophical Counterpoint**: Embrace of particularity and dialectical interpretation

## Research Priorities
- Document historical development of Ramist realism
- Analyze theological consequences of reductive biblical interpretation
- Develop constructive alternative hermeneutical approach
