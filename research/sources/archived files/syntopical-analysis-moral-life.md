# Syntopical Analysis: The Moral Life and MAGA Christianism
#syntopical_analysis

## Key Theoretical Frameworks

### Contingency in Aquinas's Ethics (Bowlin)

- **Contingent Moral Judgment**: Aquinas understood the challenge of moral life not as determining abstract principles but applying them in contingent circumstances
- **Functional Virtue**: Virtues are significant because they help us navigate contingencies that hinder achieving good
- **Contingent Goodness**: The goodness of will's objects can change unexpectedly, requiring virtuous discernment
- **Natural Law and Voluntarism**: Moral criticism requires voluntary origins for actions to be blameworthy
- **Application to MAGA Critique**: Challenges primitive biblicism by showing Scripture doesn't provide unmediated moral truth; moral judgment requires contingent discernment

### Divine Motivation Theory (Zagzebski)

- **Motivational Foundation**: Morality derives from divine motives rather than divine commands or abstract principles
- **Affective Moral Perception**: Three levels of moral judgment (emotion-laden perception, thinned judgment, foundational emotion-based judgments)
- **Mimetic Formation**: "Good motives for us are forms of imitating the divine motives... We imitate God by loving what God loves"
- **Thick Affective Properties**: "The thick properties that the world has are those perceived by God... The lovability of the world comes into existence with God's loving it"
- **Incarnational Necessity**: "The imitatio Dei is made possible by the imitatio Christi" - divine nature requires incarnate exemplar
- **Application to MAGA Critique**: Challenges practical atheism by showing Jesus isn't just exemplar of principles but the means of moral formation through participation

### Cultural-Historical Ethics (Bretherton)

- **Against Abstract Natural Law**: Ethics requires cultural-historical empathy rather than abstract principles detached from context
- **Church-World Relationship**: "If the world cannot know itself as the world without the church, the church cannot know itself as the church without the world"
- **Faithful Secularity**: Political and theological practices are "coemergent, standing simultaneously in a mutually reparative and critical relation"
- **Against Nostalgic Christianity**: Rejects a "dangerous nostalgia that sacralizes the past and falsely demonizes the present"
- **Community Through Conflict**: Community formation involves both conflict and conciliation, not pre-modern harmony disrupted by modern conflict
- **Vulnerability vs. Control**: "Strategies of invulnerability and keeping control are antimissiological"
- **Disidentification**: Christians must "disidentify with, and cease to invest in, the idolatrous structures" of contemporary culture
- **Application to MAGA Critique**: Challenges binary apocalypticism by rejecting both nostalgic orientation toward imagined Christian past and simplistic division between church and world

### Theological Foundations of Modern Ethics (Schneewind)

- **Voluntarism Challenge**: Modern ethical frameworks developed as responses to theological voluntarism
- **Character and Political Objections**: Voluntarism "causes servility" and was charged with slandering human nature "to excuse political despotism"
- **New Moral Demands**: Anti-voluntarists required moral principles to cover all actions, be necessarily true, and provide motivation
- **Agency Question**: Whether human action follows deterministic laws or humans are "originators of their actions"
- **Morality and Epistemology**: "Substantive moral beliefs imposed conditions on theories of knowledge" - morality shaped epistemology
- **Application to MAGA Critique**: Shows how theological positions directly impact political possibilities, explaining how MAGA Christianism's theological errors enable problematic politics

## Synthesized Framework for MAGA Christianism Critique

### Against Primitive Biblicism

1. **Contingent Moral Judgment**: Moral discernment requires attention to contingent realities, not just abstract principles (Bowlin)
2. **Affective Participation**: Biblical interpretation requires participation in divine motivation, not just cognitive understanding (Zagzebski)
3. **Cultural-Historical Hermeneutics**: Scripture must be read within cultural-historical contexts, not as abstract timeless principles (Bretherton)
4. **Theological Foundations**: Biblical interpretation is always shaped by theological frameworks that have political implications (Schneewind)

### Against Practical Atheism

1. **Virtue for Contingency**: Christian virtues are functional capacities for navigating contingent moral situations (Bowlin)
2. **Christ as Exemplar**: Jesus is not just example of principles but the means of moral formation through participation (Zagzebski)
3. **Church-World Relationship**: Christian witness requires engagement with, not withdrawal from, contingent realities (Bretherton)
4. **Theological-Political Connection**: Political positions reflect theological commitments, not just pragmatic calculations (Schneewind)

### Against Binary Apocalypticism

1. **Contingent Goodness**: The goodness of particular choices changes with circumstances, resisting rigid categorization (Bowlin)
2. **Thick Affective Properties**: Moral perception through divine motivation reveals complexity beyond binary divisions (Zagzebski)
3. **Field of Wheat and Tares**: Every era contains both good and evil requiring discernment, not absolute judgment (Bretherton)
4. **Human Agency**: Political developments reflect contingent human choices, not deterministic necessity (Schneewind)

## Political Applications

### Contingency vs. Deterministic Political Narratives

- MAGA Christianism's deterministic narratives (America's decline, inevitable restoration) contradict Christian acknowledgment of contingency
- Political claims framing policies or leaders as divinely mandated represent theological departure from tradition
- Christian political witness embraces contingency rather than seeking false certainty

### Divine Motivation vs. Divine Command

- Political leaders should be judged by how their motivations reflect divine goodness, not claims to divine appointment
- Shifts political discourse from "Is this leader appointed by God?" to "Does this leader reflect Christ's example?"
- Challenges political voluntarism that places leaders beyond moral critique

### Mimetic Formation vs. Abstract Principles

- Christian politics centers on character formation and virtue, not just policy positions
- Pragmatic support for leaders regardless of character represents failure of mimetic formation
- Political engagement should reflect Christ-like motivations, not just alignment with abstract principles

### Cultural-Historical Engagement vs. Nostalgic Essentialism

- Political appeals to "restore Christian America" often sacralize particular cultural formations
- Every era contains both wheat and tares requiring discernment, challenging narratives of decline
- Challenges essentialist view of America as fundamentally "Christian" in some ontological sense

### Vulnerability vs. Control

- Christian mission requires vulnerability rather than political strategies of control and dominance
- MAGA Christianism's focus on political dominance departs from Christ's kenotic example
- Faithful witness may sometimes require losing political battles rather than winning at all costs

### Theological Roots of Political Positions

- MAGA Christianism's theological mutations enable authoritarian political tendencies
- Historical precedents show connection between theological error and political harm
- Critique identifies established patterns rather than imposing contemporary concerns on theology

### The Priority of Morality to Epistemology

- "Alternative facts" reflect moral commitments that shape how evidence is evaluated
- Epistemological problems stem from deeper moral and theological distortions
- Critique must address moral framework that distorts capacity to evaluate information

### Agency and Responsibility

- MAGA Christianism inconsistently applies determinism and responsibility across contexts
- Selective application of theological concepts serves political ends rather than coherent theology
- Christian account of political agency balances human responsibility with divine sovereignty

## Methodological Approach

1. **Historical Contextualization**: Show how MAGA Christianism revives theological positions previously critiqued within tradition
2. **Virtue-Centered Politics**: Develop political ethic centered on Christ-formed virtue rather than abstract principles
3. **Embracing Contingency**: Articulate Christian political witness that embraces rather than denies contingency
4. **Faithful Vulnerability**: Describe political engagement that embraces vulnerability rather than control
5. **Epistemological Reformation**: Address how theological commitments shape political epistemology

## Key Sources for Further Integration

- **Hauerwas**: Will likely emphasize community formation and narrative-shaped virtue
- **Yoder**: Will likely emphasize counter-cultural witness and critique of Constantinian accommodation
- **Augustine**: Already implicitly present in discussions of contingency, love, and the earthly city

## Next Steps for Research

1. Examine how MAGA Christianism's theological mutations manifest in specific political contexts
2. Analyze convergence and divergence between the four theoretical frameworks
3. Identify additional theological resources for constructive alternative to MAGA Christianism
4. Develop concrete case studies demonstrating political implications of theological distortions
