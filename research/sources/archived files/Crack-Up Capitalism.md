- “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” he wrote. “The great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=48))

- we make a mistake if we see the world only in this jigsaw of nations. In fact, as scholars remind us, the modern world is pockmarked, perforated, tattered and jagged, ripped up and pinpricked. Inside the containers of nations are unusual legal spaces, anomalous territories, and peculiar jurisdictions. There are city-states, havens, enclaves, free ports, high-tech parks, duty-free districts, and innovation hubs. The world of nations is riddled with zones—and they define the politics of the present in ways we are only starting to understand.

- The flight of corporate profits to these low- or zero-tax jurisdictions costs the United States alone $70 billion a year in tax revenue, while offshore tax shelters hold an estimated $8.7 trillion of the world’s wealth.

- In his first run for office, candidate Barack Obama singled out Ugland House in the Cayman Islands, which contained twelve thousand corporations. “That’s either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record,” he said.

- There are over 5,400 zones in the world, far more regimes than in Thiel’s fantasy of a future world of a thousand countries. One thousand new zones have appeared in the last decade alone. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=81))
- Some are no bigger than a factory or a warehouse, a switch-point in the logistical circuitry of the global market, or a site for storing, assembling, or refining a product to avoid tariffs.13 Others are urban megaprojects—such as New Songdo City (Songdo International Business District), in South Korea; Neom, in Saudi Arabia; or the city of Fujisawa, in Japan—which run under their own rules like private city-states.

- I use the metaphor of perforation to describe how capitalism works by punching holes in the territory of the nation-state, creating zones of exception with different laws and often no democratic oversight. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=95))

- Most of the world’s zones are in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. China alone has almost half of them. Europe and North America combine for less than 10 percent.18 Yet as we will see, zones have some of their most ardent supporters in the West, who hail them as experiments in what I call micro-ordering, or the creation of alternative political arrangements at a small scale. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=101))
- Champions of the zone suggest that free-market utopia might be reached through acts of secession and fragmentation, carving out liberated territory within and beyond nations, with both disciplining and demonstration effects for other states. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=105))
- Promoters of perforation cast themselves melodramatically as guerrillas of the Right, reclaiming—and decomposing—the nation-state, zone by zone. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=108))

- The dominant visualizations are of connection: blue lines of lasers linking the world’s far-flung locations, a skein of exchange and mobility. The trend was toward interconnection: the World Trade Organization, the European Union, and the North American Free Trade Agreement were created within a few years of one another. But there was also an alternative timeline if you looked closely, one that was marked as much by fragmentation as unity. The two Germanys unified in 1990, but the Soviet Union splintered the following year. Yugoslavia dissolved ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=146))

- Goods and money were free to flow, but not people. Walls were built the world over. By one estimate, more than ten thousand miles of borders worldwide have been hardened with barriers. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=151))
- Zones help us rethink globalization as a fracturing of the map into what scholars call the “archipelago economy of offshore,” with territories engaged in perpetual competition for roving clients, savers, and investors. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=171))
- We must appreciate how, for market radicals, the zone was not merely the means to an economic end but an inspiration for the reorganization of global politics as a whole. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=177))

- democracy as it has grown up in Western societies may be inimical to the growth and maintenance of markets.” ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=185))
- Stephen Moore, a longtime fellow of the Heritage Foundation and mainstream right-wing intellectual, stated frankly: “Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy. I’m not even a big believer in democracy.” ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=189))
- they proposed something surprising: maybe capitalism had secretly lost. Maybe social democratic superstates were picking up where communist ones left off, as state spending was only continuing to grow. Maybe for the true victory of capitalism, it was necessary to go further. What if the end of history was not the checkerboard of two-hundred-plus nation-states existing under conditions of liberal democracy, but tens of thousands of jurisdictions of various political systems in constant competition?

- “Seasteads” would escape the taxing and regulating state, declare independence, and spark what he dubbed a “Cambrian Explosion in government.”4 In the jargon of Silicon Valley, these would be start-up nations.

- The two shared a basic lack of commitment to democracy. “Democracy is not the answer,” Patri wrote, it is merely “the current industry standard.”5 His ideal communities would be modeled on corporations. “You just get more effective products from corporations competing with each other for customers than you get from democratic systems,” he said.

- Blessed with a deep and wide harbor protected from typhoons by a mountain left over from a Mesozoic supervolcanic explosion, its city was named Victoria after the monarch and turned into an entrepôt free of customs duties with the economy driven by the drug trade—the through traffic of opium grown and processed in India and shipped on to Chinese consumers.

- In 1898, the Japanese defeated China and took Taiwan as their booty. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=282))
- The broader Chinese economy was also forced open by law. While its sovereignty was left formally intact, treaties bound the government to a low tariff policy. The “most-favored-nation” principle meant that the privileges granted one power, say the United States, were immediately granted to the Russians, the Germans, the French, and so on. These laws were remembered as the “unequal treaties”—the core of China’s “century of humiliation.” A leading Chinese diplomat referred to them in 1912 as secured “with the aid of the sword.”15 Less often observed is how the combination of violence, territory, and law helped set the template for the economic globalization in the century that would follow. Zones created patchworks of semi-sovereignty: container ports and military bases were ceded on long-term leases; trade organizations like the WTO worked on the most-favored-nation principle; and treaties allowed foreign investors to be governed by their own courts.

- Funded by conservative donors, including the Getty Oil company and the Sarah Scaife Foundation, he was there to film the first episode of what would be his wildly popular PBS series Free to Choose.24 In his midsixties, Friedman was nearing the end of his academic career and reaching the height of his fame. His regular Newsweek column was already read in the homes of millions of Americans, and his star rose further when he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1976. The series would broadcast into homes all over the United States and eventually in Britain, accompanied by a book version, which spent an astounding fifty-one weeks on the New York Times bestseller list as the top-selling nonfiction book of 1980. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=317))
- In what one journalist called “Milton Friedman’s dream world,” “labor is obliged to go wherever capital directs it, for whatever it chooses to pay.”28 Friedman himself dubbed Hong Kong “an almost laboratory experiment in what happens when government is limited to its proper function”: people know that when people fail, “they bear the cost.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=332))
- What made such discipline possible was first and foremost the absence of democracy. No labor unions or popular elections meant no leverage for workers or citizens. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=344))
- Its members called themselves neoliberals into the 1950s.41 Although the term has many definitions, this book uses neoliberal as a helpful shorthand for those associated with the MPS and its affiliated think tanks. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=371))
- Within the neoliberal group, there were thinkers of different shades but they were united by the belief that capitalism had to be protected from democracy in the age of mass democracy. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=373))
- Those that concern us most in this book would recognize themselves in the term libertarian. Although libertarianism contains many schools and tendencies, they are united by the belief that the state’s role is to protect the market, not to own property, manage resources, direct companies, or deliver services like health care, housing, utilities, or infrastructure. Maintenance of inner and outer security, the protection of private property, and the sanctity of contract: these should be the main role of the government. The main difference, as we will see, is between those who believe in a minimal state (sometimes called minarchists) and those who believe in no state at all (known as anarcho-capitalists). ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=375))
- The Mont Pelerinians came to praise Hong Kong, but many were also there to smuggle its essence out in their luggage ahead of what they feared was its imminent demise. In the years and decades afterward, Friedman and his collaborators created a Portable Hong Kong, miniaturized and stripped of internal contradictions, complexity, and differences of class and culture. They turned it into a mobile template, untethered from place and freed for realization elsewhere. As a model zone, Hong Kong held out the prospect of an escape from the dilemmas and pressures of midcentury democracy. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=435))
- Thatcher paid little heed when the Chinese premier mentioned that they were opening parts of the southern coast as “special areas” free to develop their own foreign trade yet the aside would be of great consequence.81 They were about to teach the British about the changing nature of capitalism. China’s rise to global economic power would happen, in part, by turning the country into a galaxy of miniature Hong Kongs. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=512))
- After he became paramount leader in December 1978—and Time’s Person of the Year—the first four experimental special economic zones (SEZs) were created on the Pearl River Delta, nestled up to Hong Kong on the South China Sea. In contrast to the shock treatment meted out by Augusto Pinochet to Chile after his 1973 coup, or the Big Bang overnight price reforms carried out in postcommunist Russia and Eastern Europe, China used a model of “experimental gradualism,” opening up sluices and locks to foreign investors and market-determined prices rather than dynamiting the levee and letting it all flood ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=541))
- even Chinese citizens needed visas to enter, “quarantining a space of economic experimentation.”90 Inside, a radical undertaking was underway. Local entrepreneurs were left to self-organize with little or no direction from Beijing, and government took the form of corporate management.91 The zone welcomed a massive influx of foreign investment and hosted an epochal transformation: the rendering of Chinese land and labor back into commodities. Beginning in 1982, contracts were introduced for workers in Shenzhen, breaking with communist China’s “iron rice bowl” tradition of permanent employment. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=558))
- What became known as zone fever gripped the nation, as huge amounts of land were sucked from rural usage and collective ownership and transformed into private property on long-term leaseholds, constituting one of the biggest transfers of public into private wealth in the modern age.96 On paper, the success was staggering, one of the fastest episodes of economic growth in world history.97 In 1980, officials had aimed to bring perhaps three hundred thousand people to Shenzhen by 2000.98 The real number was ten million. By 2020, the population had doubled again, to twenty million, with a GDP greater than Singapore or Hong Kong. The template was set for a “China of enclaves,” what some dubbed the country’s “zonification.” ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=571))
- From their beginnings in the late 1970s, the SEZs multiplied from southern anomalies to further experiments up the coast, until they spread across the entire country.103 They were joined by zone-like small-scale efforts of marketization, as “town and village enterprises” were permitted to produce and sell for the market.104 The “decollectivization” of the countryside created a reserve army of migrant laborers who moved between the city and the countryside, offering their labor as the crucial input for the construction-led boom. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=587))
- a network that allows for the channeling of investment and labor through a honeycomb of zones, with public accountability limited by outlawing direct elections above the local level. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=595))
- there was a fitting symmetry between the image of Milton Friedman over the skyline of Hong Kong in Free to Choose and the famous billboard in Shenzhen showing Deng Xiaoping over its own skyline. Neither man over five feet tall, they loomed large as champions of the shared belief that a competitive edge could be gained in global markets by suspending the pressures of a voting public within a sequestered territory, allowing private market actors to act with the aid of a cooperative state and set of laws. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=600))
- Capitalism did not need democracy to work, and the path to success led through the zone. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=606))

- When describing the experiment, Friedman talked about the low tax rate, the protection of private property, the trustworthy courts, the light-touch regulation, the low barriers to trade—the pithy outline of the Portable Hong Kong. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=613))
- Friedman opted instead, as he spoke to students at the University of Hong Kong, to remind them of the dangers of democracy. “Unfortunately, political democracy has elements which tend to destroy economic freedom,” he told them. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=625))
- One was its 15 percent flat tax, ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=629))
- Another was the constitutional clause enforcing a balanced budget, which prevented Keynesian expansionary spending and put hard limits on state investment. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=633))
- Yet another was the celebration of the possibility of economic freedom without political freedom, or what scholars call liberal authoritarianism. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=636))
- the liberal NGO Freedom House as their template, Rabushka and Friedman convened a series of workshops in the late 1980s to devise what they called an Economic Freedom of the World index that self-consciously broke with what one of its drafters called “this fetish for democracy” and ranked the world’s territories instead by their tax burden, openness of borders to trade, ease of doing business, along with other indicators.116 Hong Kong took top spot, as it would for over two decades. The definition of freedom they used in their calculations meant that democracy was a moot point, monetary stability was paramount, and any expansion of social services meant a fall in the rankings. They declared the “‘right’ to food, clothing, medical services, housing or a minimal income level” as “‘forced labor’ requirements” and called redistribution “(slave) labor.”117 Taxation was theft, pure and simple. According to the authors, it did not matter “whether the theft takes place via the ballot box, or more directly as in the style of an armed robbery.” ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=640))
- an authoritarian government that protects free markets is preferable to a democratic one that redesigns them. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=660))
- The dismal fact was that average Hong Kong residents did not have a vote in selecting their leader but, through their CEOs, top corporations did. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=675))
- Asked why suffrage could not be expanded, he laid out the logic of restricted franchise in a matter-of-fact response. It was a “numbers game,” he said. Expanding the vote would increase the power of the poor and lead to “the kind of politics” that favor the expansion of the welfare state instead of business-friendly policies.125 For him, the trade-off between economic and political freedom was clear as day. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=679))
- China’s success made it look like state capitalism without democracy might be a winning formula. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=692))
- This was a capitalist paradise with little competition. The lack of inheritance tax means the wealth is dynastic and leaves little interest in challenging the status quo. Thomas Piketty and Li Yang found that the top 15 percent wealthiest in Hong Kong were the least likely to support moves to more democracy. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=729))
- In the end, the essence of the Hong Kong model was not an abstract idea of economic freedom. Rather it was the legal demarcation of a small territory with little or no democracy and close collusion between a tight club of business elites and the government to capitalize on the captive market through maximal economic openness and the rising value of scarce land. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=733))
- London. The “Square Mile” of the financial district on the north bank of the Thames—known as the City—is not altogether part of its host country. When the Normans invaded, the City kept its property, its militia, and its own Lord Mayor. Its governing body, called simply the Corporation of London until recently, predates Parliament.3 To this day, as the journalist Nicholas Shaxson reminds us, when the king or queen enters the City, he or she has to touch the mayor’s sword.4 The City is a primal zone, carved out from its surrounding political space and governed by different rules. Most notable is the fact that, in its elections, as in Hong Kong’s, businesses have ballots too. Their thirty-two thousand votes outnumber those of the nine thousand humans.5 One academic compares it to the early modern city-states of Genoa and Venice. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=749))
- As Britain’s overseas empire dissolved, a “Second British Empire” arose in its place as a collection of tax havens, including British dependent territories like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and former colonies like Singapore, Ireland, and Dubai.8 And the City was at the center of it all. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=765))
- Gathering at the pub, a clutch of Conservative politicians set out a proposal not so different from Shand’s: parcel off chunks of London, free investors in those areas from taxes and regulations, and give them subsidies and grants on top of that, to make what had been formerly called corruption into the law of the land.12 The areas would be called enterprise zones. In the Docklands, the zone would turn a working-class neighborhood into a second financial district. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=792))
- He pitched a “non-plan”: rather than determining in advance what should be built, a vacuum would be created where something new might arise. British politicians could sequester swaths of inner cities and make them into new “Crown colonies” without any control of the inflow and outflow of people, goods, or money. In his thought experiment, people who opted in would lose their national citizenship and protections but would be liberated to build, truck, and barter unimpeded by taxation or regulation of any kind. The zones would leave the European Economic Community and re-create Hong Kong “inside inner Liverpool or inner Glasgow.” ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=821))
- Eleven enterprise zones were rolled out in Thatcher’s first budget.26 All were exempted from requirements for local planning approval, freed from local taxes for ten years, and provided capital allowances for commercial buildings. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=844))
- The historian Perry Anderson recalls an episode at the World Bank when Walters praised Hong Kong as the “freest society in the world.” When the eminent statistician Angus Maddison interjected that it “doesn’t even have elections,” Walters replied with a “beatific smile” and said, “Yes, that’s just what I meant.” ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=870))
- Opportunity zones cut requirements for all oversight, approval, and reporting. Trump’s own inner circle, including his former press secretary and his son-in-law, cashed in immediately. Zones were used to build luxury housing in Miami and condo towers in Westchester County complete with doggie spas. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1079))
- Although built in one of the most high-rent districts in the world, the complex was funded through a special program that sells visas to overseas investors who put money in economically distressed areas. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1096))
- The zone shows how this quality is built in by design, multiplied in business improvement districts and many other forms of land being given to developers outright, on the model of what some call “incentivized urbanization” and others call “geobribery.”126 As geographers have shown time and again, gentrification is not what happens when the market is set free. It happens when the state leads it by the hand. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1137))

- Speaking to an audience of two thousand at the University of Cape Town in 1976, Milton Friedman announced that democracy was overrated. The market was a much surer route to liberty, he said; voting by dollars was better than voting by ballots.3 The key to freedom was not free elections but decentralization of state power itself.

- the government chose a version of what Friedman was recommending: decentralization instead of democracy. Creating a series of so-called homelands on the baseless notion (derived from colonial anthropology) that certain populations rightfully belonged in certain territories. Many homelands were noncontiguous, creating a fragmented landscape that led anti-apartheid activists to dub them Bantustans, combining the umbrella South African category for Africans with a suffix from the precedent of Pakistan, which was split by colonial powers into West and East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) on opposite sides of independent India.

- Transkei was the first of four fake nations created in South Africa’s effort to prove that it was following the trend toward self-determination and the end of empire.7 It was followed by Bophuthatswana in 1977, Venda in 1979, and Ciskei in 1981. Under Bantustan policy, Black South Africans lost their South African citizenship and were made into citizens of homelands that many had never set foot in. Upwards of 3.5 million people were relocated by force, especially the elderly, women, the unemployed, and opponents of the regime.8 The idea was to make South Africa itself progressively whiter while retaining access to an itinerant labor force concentrated in balkanized territories. It was a vision where only a minority of the population were citizens and the rest guest workers. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1613))
- The instrument used in Ciskei was the export processing zone, or EPZ. An EPZ traced out a patch of territory that was legally designated as outside the host country: an offshore space without leaving home soil, with a different set of regulations, rules, and oversight, inevitably more favorable to investors. As scholars like Patrick Neveling have shown, EPZs had several antecedents. One was foreign trade zones in the United States, duty-free spaces created out of warehouses or factories. First seen in America in the 1930s, these took off in the 1980s, especially for oil processing and automobile assembly.24 Another forerunner was the duty-free zone of Shannon Airport in the Republic of Ireland. Once a necessary stopover for transatlantic flights, Shannon adapted after aircraft range improved and rendered it redundant by becoming a trailblazer of tax-free manufacturing in 1958.25 A third precursor was in Taiwan, which set up its first EPZ in the port of Kaohsiung in 1966. An American labor leader testified about seeing the Kaohsiung EPZ a few years later, separated from the city by a high fence and armed guards. He recounted his guide explaining “with obvious pleasure that by virtue of the fence and a few laws, the land we were standing on was no longer considered part of Taiwan.” Companies operating inside the fence could avoid paying Taiwan’s domestic taxes. He called the zones “fantasy islands for intensifying corporate profits.” ([Location 1661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1661))
- The libertarian Bantustan was not an expression of the popular longing of the South African people. It was not a lever to weaken the grip of the apartheid state.

- Other South African market radicals have embraced the racial experiment of Orania. At the annual meeting of the South African Libertarian Society held there in 2015, Louw jokingly referred to it as an adaptation of the homeland model to create an “Afrikanerstan.”65 For libertarians, the foremost attraction is its structure as a private entity.66 Orania’s leader is the chief executive, and residents are shareholders in the mother company.67 It also issues its own currency, the ora. Another South African libertarian described Orania as “a rare example of a libertarian enclave,” where membership was governed by voluntary contract as a way of achieving freedom from “the tyranny of the majority.” ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1804))
- Orania has gained traction worldwide. In 2019, Australian Far Right groups were using Orania as a template for creating “Anglo-European enclaves” as bases for a coming race war.70 In the United States, the white nationalist group American Renaissance praised Orania as a place where Afrikaners “could keep white and where they could preserve their language and culture” and “set up a private corporation to run it, with the power to grant residency only to certain approved Afrikaners.” ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1817))

- voluntary racial segregation from below would not be troubled by the same problems of legitimacy as the top-down separatist state. The post–Jim Crow United States offered a great precedent—a country where segregation happened through the market rather than overt state intervention.73 According to the libertarian model, racial separation and racial inequality created by the push and pull of economic forces posed no threat to the principles of the free market. Citizen-customers would vote with their feet and sort out the population organically. If the outcome was a balance of economic power that looked much like it had at the outset, then so be it.

In 1979, the Far Eastern Economic Review had reported that free trade zones, “artificially inseminated and easily transplantable into any developing nation … have spread across the Third World like a test tube baby boom.”80 What had happened in the hinterland of the Eastern Cape, with its clusters of sweatshops, was very modern and, in some ways, the future.

- took the canton model to a more radical conclusion. In two novels from the early 1990s, the American author Neal Stephenson conjured up a world very much like the libertarian fantasy. In his 1992 Snow Crash, the “New South Africa Franchulate” is an “apartheid burbclave,” a fictional version of the real-life Orania: privately owned, privately governed.87 He expanded on the vision in his next novel, The Diamond Age, which featured an Orania-like “clave” of Boers—“stocky blonds in suits or the most conservative sorts of dresses, usually with half a dozen kids in tow.” ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1898))
- Among his most evocative ideas was that of the phyle, taken from the ancient Greek word for “tribe” or “clan.” The Diamond Age features phyles based on lineage but also “synthetic” ones, “tribes that people just made up out of thin air.”89 However artificial, these phyles became real through legal agreement and cohabitation, shared ritual and codes of conduct. This openness was made possible by the footloose investor capital of manufacturers scouring the world for low wages and government giveaways. Container ships and telecommunications made it as easy to set up in the rural Eastern Cape as in Youngstown or Sunderland—and much cheaper.

- Most people saw this wave of nations through the lens of politics—some worried about resurgent “neo-nationalism.” Market radicals saw it through the lens of capitalism—and were happy with what they saw. Each state spawned by secession was a new jurisdiction, a start-up territory that might offer itself as a refuge for flight capital or a site of unregulated business or research. Micronations were zones, bound spaces of legal difference small enough to stage economic experiments. They were also phyles—voluntary gatherings of like-minded residents. Secession was a way to subdivide the earth and bring new territories into the bustling marketplace of global competition. Neo-nationalism could be the harbinger of a coming golden age of social sorting defined by ever-shrinking jurisdictions.

- In the United States, two groups formed an alliance in response to this moment of geopolitical churn: market radicals seeking passage to a capitalist polity beyond democracy and neo-Confederates seeking to resurrect the Old South. As in Leon Louw and Frances Kendall’s blueprints for South Africa, they wove together principles of decentralized capitalist competition and racial homogeneity. This right-wing alliance dreamed of Bantustans of choice—Grand Apartheid from below. Though their immediate goal failed, their vision of laissez-faire segregation lived on. For them, secession was the path to a world that was socially divided but economically integrated—separate but global.

- The most important figure in the secessionist alliance was Murray Rothbard. Born in the Bronx in 1926, he came up through the world of neoliberal think tanks, becoming a member of the Mont Pelerin Society in the 1950s.4 Throughout his career, he developed a particularly radical version of libertarianism known as anarcho-capitalism.

These would be anti-republics, private ownership and exchange displacing any trace of popular sovereignty. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1961))
- “The more states the world is fragmented into,” Rothbard wrote, “the less power any one state can build up.” It was a first principle for him that secession movements should be celebrated and supported “wherever and however they may arise.”6 Crack-up was the flywheel of human progress. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1970))
- As fuel for secession, Rothbard saw nationalism as a positive force. Separatist movements, from Scotland to Croatia to Biafra, were built on a common sense of group belonging in a nation or an ethnicity.10 In the United States, he was especially interested in the potential of Black nationalism. He admired those in the Black freedom struggle who aimed for communal self-help and collective self-defense and endorsed Malcolm X’s call for separatism over Martin Luther King Jr.’s call for restraint and nonviolence.11 Rothbard and his collaborators believed that Black secession from the United States was achievable; indeed, communities should respect the principle of racial separation.12 He became frustrated by the cross-racial collaboration of white and Black radicals. Blacks should work with Blacks, he thought, just as it was “the responsibility of whites to build the white movement.” ([Location 1984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=1984))

- The paleo-libertarians hoped to “hive off” the “hippies, druggies, and militantly anti-Christian atheists” of the broader libertarian movement to defend Judeo-Christian traditions and Western culture and restore the focus on the family, church, and community as both protection against the state and the building blocks of a coming stateless society.

- Secession was the means; anarcho-capitalist society was the end. Paleo-libertarians hoped they could keep the dissolution rolling back across the Atlantic.

- Eastern Europe became the vanguard of global capitalism. Estonia was governed by a man in his early thirties who claimed that the only economic book he’d ever read was Milton Friedman’s Free to Choose.57 Tiny Montenegro set up a libertarian private university.58 Countries across the region introduced low flat taxes on the advice of neoliberal think tanks.59 As Hoppe saw it, an Eastern Europe filled with small open economies would put pressure on the welfare programs of the West, as those economies sucked in investment and lured away manufacturing jobs. “The emergence of a handful of Eastern European ‘Hong Kongs’ or ‘Singapores,’” he wrote, “would quickly attract substantial amounts of Western capital and entrepreneurial talent.” ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2156))
- These future states would be internally homogeneous, he wrote, replacing “the forced integration of the past” with the “voluntary physical segregation of distinct cultures.”61 Hoppe believed that the new territories should be much smaller than the contemporary nation-state. “The smaller the country,” he noted, “the greater pressure to opt for free trade rather than protectionism.”62 Citing micronations and city-states as templates, he called for “a world of tens of thousands of free countries, regions, and cantons, of hundreds of thousands of free cities.” It was a vision of something like Europe’s Middle Ages—the continent in the year 1000 had been a dense pattern of thousands of different polities, reduced over time to a few dozen. Rothbard had said: repeal the twentieth century. Hoppe’s message was more extreme: repeal the millennium. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2167))

Racial separatism would be the new norm: “Latino nationalist communities” in California and the Southwest, Black communities in the “inner cities,” a “Christian reconstructionist Protestant state” in the Midwest.69 For Spencer, present-day politics were heading toward disintegration.

For over a century, the city had been a laboratory for the forms of contract, exclusion, and segregation that the paleo alliance dreamed of. In the 1920s, it passed a law prohibiting racial mixing on city blocks. Whites policed the divisions with vigilante violence. As the city grew, the whites seceded into incorporated enclaves; their tax dollars would pay for their own schools, not those of the city at large.

- By the end of the century, gated communities were more than just a new kind of real estate—they became metaphors of the moment.7 They seemed to capture the paradox of the post–Cold War decade, when two forces battled each other. One was a sense of ever-greater connection, of seamless mobility and communication. The other was a feeling of isolation, of social separation and new walls—global apartheid, to use a term that gained currency even as the system formally vanished in South Africa.8 Gated communities were closed but interconnected, linked to the world by “ribbons of roadway, fiber-optic cables and digital electromagnetic signals.”9 Struggling to describe the emerging order, many reached to the deep past and diagnosed the return of a new Middle Ages. “We are building a kind of medieval landscape,” an architecture critic lamented, “in which defensible, walled and gated towns dot the countryside.” ([Location 2296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2296))

- Milton and Rose Friedman blazed the trail, moving out in 1979. They bought a second home in Sea Ranch and a primary residence in Royal Towers, the tallest building on San Francisco’s Russian Hill, rising twenty-nine stories above a thicket of bay-windowed terrace houses. At the base of the hill was the Cato Institute, founded by Charles Koch, Ed Crane, and Murray Rothbard. ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2423))
- But gated communities were more than just refuges. They were zones to experiment in. A pair of economists described them as “contractual governments … formed by entrepreneurs who produce and sell constitutional rules.”48 Votes were allotted by housing unit, or even by the size of the housing unit, instead of the old model of “one person, one vote,” which to their mind was producing suboptimal outcomes.49 Looked at this way, the new walled towns became exhibits in the case for capitalism without democracy.

- The virtue of the master-planned community was that it was voluntary. It had a tailored set of rules, visible from the outset, which you could either opt into and buy a home, or choose not to, and shop elsewhere. As opposed to the larger jurisdiction of a city, county, or state, the homeowner association (HOA) was a compact unit, an opportunity for micro-ordering. “What does this little ‘government’ do?” Tullock asked. They owned and maintained the streets and installed fire hydrants. Private companies provided fire protection, gas, electricity, cable, and garbage collection. The community was defended by the local sheriff but added its own guards for night shifts. It also had precise aesthetic prescriptions, including how one’s garden could look from the street and the color of one’s house. “If we get some eccentric who would like to paint his house purple,” Tullock noted, “he can be stopped.” ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2470))
- Tullock used the community as evidence for a theory he called “sociological federalism,” which stated frankly that the most pertinent sociological categories are ethnicity and race. The population of Sunshine Mountain Ridge was “rather homogenous,” he noted—that is, almost entirely white and non-Hispanic, whereas almost a third of the people in the surrounding Pima County were of Mexican background. For Tullock, this was not a problem but a confirmation of his assumption: “It seems that people, on the whole, like living with other people who are similar to them.” ([Location 2480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=2480))

A California couple received a daily fine for having a wooden rather than a metal swing set. A Florida woman was taken to court for a dog that weighed over thirty pounds.70 The private governments of the gated community constrained free choice in the belief that homogeneity best secured their long-term investment.

- The central institution of the tax haven is the trust. Invented in England, the trust dates back to the time of the Crusades, when people departing to fight in the Holy Wars sought to leave their property in the hands of a confidant. In the medieval and early modern period, putting land in trust with friends or living relatives was a way to avoid it being confiscated upon their death by authorities or tax collectors. They were a means of asserting the power of elites against the rise of tax-collecting rulers. Into the twentieth century, they have filled a similar purpose.

- As he saw it, the ultimate goal of zones was to “make governments compete for people.”12 Because citizens of modern democracies were seduced by ideas of social justice, the quickest way to teach them “the virtues of a deregulated society” was “to create among them some mini-societies.”13 Once T-zones existed, he predicted, all European states would be forced to replicate them for fear of losing investors. The bottom-up compulsion of competing for scarce resources would be more effective than any design from above.14 The zone would act as pedagogue and disciplinarian.

- If there is any place in the world that has contributed to global zone fever as much as the Asian juggernauts of Hong Kong and Singapore, it is Dubai. In a few short decades, the emirate on the Persian Gulf staged a dizzying ascent from a gold-smuggling outpost with houses built of coral and sand to the gilded home of the world’s tallest hotel, the world’s only ski slope in a desert, and the world’s highest tennis court, among many other records. ([Location 3247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=3247))
- How did they do it? Authoritarianism was part of the answer. Dubai was a case study in capitalism without democracy. Through the early 2000s, it ranked as one of the least politically free places in the world, owing to the absence of popular elections, protection of free expression, and rights for noncitizens, as well as the arbitrary use of police force and practice of forced labor.7 As early as 1985, the CIA reported that in Dubai “ideology is dismissed as irrelevant to business.”8 Of course, dismissing ideology in favor of business amounted to an ideology of its own. But what kind of ideology? Most striking was the resemblance to corporate governance. Both power and ownership were concentrated entirely in the figure of the sheikh, who was frequently referred to as the CEO of Dubai, Inc. The city-state’s executive council was made up of the heads of state-owned enterprises rather than elected officials.9 The result was a short-circuiting of public deliberation—indeed, the elimination of any idea of the public at all. “The delays, the disputes, the litigation, the whole messy business of ‘Not in My Back Yard’ simply doesn’t exist in the country,” one architectural critic wrote. The city was an advertisement: “Look at what enlightened, corporate, efficient and non-democratic government can ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=3266))
- Along with Singapore and Hong Kong, Dubai proved to Yarvin that “politics is not necessary to a free, stable and productive modern society.”17 Dubai was run like a business, and this was as it should be, he said. Instead of citizens, it had customers, who expected nothing more from the state than that which was outlined in their contract.18 He felt that bonds of citizenship were mere instruments for extorting the state for benefits, which, in turn, had to be extorted from others through taxation. Abstract ideas of civic belonging or obligation had no place in Dubai. By the early 2000s, Dubai’s population was, by some estimates, 95 percent foreigners.

But this wasn’t what made it attractive to the right-wing libertarians. What they liked was harder to see: it was Dubai’s embrace of radical legal pluralism and its willingness to design bespoke jurisdictions to satisfy investors. Dubai was not just a “city-corporation.”23 It was one state with many systems, and a test run of Yarvin’s patchwork in practice.

- The leaders of the Trucial States watched the British go with regret. Sheikh Rashid said that “the whole coast, people and rulers, would all support retaining British forces in the Gulf.”32 For over a century, as one historian put it, the sheikhs were able to “outsource their military and external affairs to Britain.”33 Now they were required to not only oversee those affairs themselves but also fashion a terrain marked by familial ties, overlapping jurisdictions, and long-simmering border disputes into something that conformed to the Westphalian model of firm borders and exclusive sovereignty. With the concept of the nation-state as much of an ill fit with local reality as the idea of government by popular consent, the sheikhs opted for something other than the standard model of Wilsonian national self-determination.34 In 1971, they formed the federation of the United Arab Emirates, with Abu Dhabi as the capital.

- Dubai had unilaterally carved out the Jebel Ali Free Zone as a formally extraterritorial space, five thousand acres of land paved, wired, and ready for construction.38 Perks included the possibility of 100 percent foreign ownership, no corporate taxes for fifteen years, no personal income taxes, full repatriation of profits and capital, and, of course, the guarantee of no labor unrest, thanks to the policy of importing labor constantly threatened by deportation.39 Dubai worked by accessing a steady stream of labor from South Asia drawn by wages higher than in their own country even though they had no right of residence, guaranteeing hire-and-fire-and-deport in perpetuity. An added risk braved by workers was that thin legal protection left them vulnerable to often not being paid at all.40 While foreign residents from richer countries (known as expats rather than migrants) enjoyed all-you-can-drink brunches and the creature comforts of the West, manual workers were kept in barbed-wire encampments in the desert to minimize flight risk and costs of upkeep.

- New jurisdictions proliferated.

It was overseen by the Australian finance regulator Errol Hoopmann, who said his goal was to cordon off 110 acres of land, empty it of existing laws, and then “write our own laws to fill up that vacuum.” He compared the DIFC to the Vatican.

- one thing that nation-branding consultants discovered early on was how little value democracy added when it came to a country’s reputation. In fact, it was undemocratic countries like Dubai and Singapore that ranked especially high with tourists and investors. There was an important lesson to be learned here. Winning the capitalist game globally seemed to have little to do with abstract questions of democratic liberty. People in the industry saw this as no coincidence: centralizing power in a CEO-like head of state allowed for a unity of message.88 Democracy was messy. It folded in different visions of a country, left loose ends and dangling, ragged narratives. Capitalism without democracy could hit the target every time. Indeed, if one judged countries the way one judged companies—as everything about the global market was saying we should—then Dubai won in all metrics.

- Working with Patri Friedman, Brimen broke ground in May 2021 on a fifty-eight-acre zone on the island of Roatán, off the north coast of Honduras, with $17.5 million in capital.50 Called Próspera, the zone was not a RED but its legal successor, a ZEDE (zona de empleo y desarrollo económico, “zone of employment and economic development”), one of two in the country.51 ZEDEs remained under Honduran international and criminal law; they could no longer enter treaties independently, but otherwise offered a blank slate for building new internal institutions from scratch. ZEDEs were freed of import and export taxes and could have their own courts, security forces, education systems, and legal system.52 “We are a private venture in which all relationships are determined by contracts between the organizer and the individual business or residents,” said one advisor. “We are the epitome of free market principles.” ([Location 3767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=3767))
- one of the selling points of living in Próspera was also that you didn’t have to live there—no more than Próspera’s investors lived in the Cayman Islands, where their fund was registered. Proponents of the start-up society insisted that the twenty-first-century city was not made of concrete and glass so much as out of laws.54 True to Romer’s vision, the most important thing about a place was its rules. While earlier settlers once sought wealth in gold, crops, or railroads, the treasure of zones like Próspera in the twenty-first century was their status as a jurisdiction—their potential as a new place to pick and choose among regulations and licensing requirements.

- The idea of “netizens” and online communities was hardly a new insight; what was novel was the leap that Srinivasan made from elective online communities to the possibility that the cloud might come back down to earth.27 “Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with the digital community,” he wrote. “We recruit online for a group of people interested in founding a new virtual social network, a new city, and eventually a new country. We build the embryonic state as an open source project, we organize our internal economy around remote work, we cultivate in-person levels of civility, we simulate architecture in VR, and we create art and literature that reflects our values.”28 The numbers of members and perhaps their investments or fees would register on a publicly viewable dashboard, until a tipping point was reached where a spattering of droplets became a cloud—first a cloud town, then a cloud city, and eventually a cloud country.

- Like many tech libertarians, Srinivasan was often at pains to portray his state-building projects as business plans, complete with corporate-style pitch decks and charts. It seemed important for libertarians to insist that they were rejecting the tradition of republican democracy in favor of something more rigorous and empirically driven—“a society funded by subscription and seignorage,” as Srinivasan called his cloud country.40 But the republican political imagination still had a grip even on those who saw themselves seeking an exit from politics. Srinivasan’s description of his project as moving from sovereign individuals to the “sovereign collective” sounded very much like the classical notion of groups of people coalescing as a single demos.

- He said that the existing system in a place like the United States was a “51% democracy” while he was advocating “100% democracy,” through models where one had to actively opt in.41 It is only when you look twice that you see that the difference lies in the question of ownership. The basic principle of republican democracy is one person, one vote. Srinivasan’s cloud city blueprints were curiously silent on the question of decision-making, but one can assume that they would take their cue from corporate governance: one share, one vote. When asked about property ownership in a future cloud city, Srinivasan surprised the interviewer by replying that an individual would not actually own land—the corporation that developed it would. The individual would instead own a share in the city as a whole. ([Location 4118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=4118))
- Again, this was not quite so wild as it sounded. Political historians have written for decades on the “invented traditions” of modern nationalism: the way that modern nations were, effectively, brought into existence through the creation of mass rituals and pageantry, the codification of language in dictionaries and folk stories in anthologies, the writing and performance of national poems and plays, the erection of monuments, and the formalization of traditional forms of dress.

- A phrase he liked to use to describe this was “reverse diaspora.” He saw the real reorganization of global society after the end of the Cold War happening online, as speculative communities rearranged loyalties across national borders (at least insofar as firewalls permitted them). The territorial United States was to the internet what Great Britain had been to the United States in 1776: an incumbent polity destined to be abandoned and superseded.

- All three saw the same things: the possibility of exit created by new technology, the creation of a new global caste of meritocratic adepts, and the abandonment of the taxing, regulatory state in favor of new affiliations and even new territories organized along the lines of private corporations.

- Iran banned bitcoin mining in 2021 after it led to blackouts and possibly the shutdown of a nuclear reactor. China, one of the world’s biggest bitcoin producers, banned it, too, leading miners to relocate their rigs to places like Canada, South Dakota, and Texas, sites of more traditional commodity extraction.53 The annual electricity consumption of bitcoin mining is estimated to be higher than that of the entire country of Sweden.54 Srinivasan’s discussion of cloud country made no mention of energy usage or climate change. The burdens of adjustment to rising tides, floods, fires, and ever more frequent extreme weather events would presumably be borne by others.

- In the event, the most important destinations for Srinivasan’s colleagues were less Mars than Mar-a-Lago. Miami opened its arms to the tech sector in 2020, making it what the Financial Times hyped as “the most important city in America.”67 Thiel bought two houses on Dubai-like artificial islands near Miami Beach for $18 million.68 Keith Rabois, a partner at Thiel’s venture capital firm, bought a home on the same islands for $29 million.69 Miami seemed to be simply following the well-worn playbook of Sunbelt cities luring investors through low taxes and light-touch regulation, but Srinivasan hyped it as “the first of a new set of international cloud capitals and start-up cities.”70 He touted Miami as the “Singapore of Latin America,” although it would probably be better described as its Dubai: an enclave of conspicuous consumption and a laundromat for dirty money from the region. While Singapore was known for its intolerance of corruption, Florida was among the most corrupt places in the nation.

- He scandalized the architecture world when he laid out this anarcho-capitalist vision at the World Architectural Congress, arguing that governments should abolish all social and affordable housing, eliminate all housing standards, and privatize all streets, squares, public spaces, and parks.8 The status quo was doomed—“the hope lies in what we dare to build afterwards.”9 The new city he proposed would offer the chance to “irradiate the collective imaginary within the advanced societies, and become a torch leading the way forward for a long overdue political revolution.”10 Utopian architecture had too often tried to work against the trends of the free market and capitalism; he wanted to lean into them.

- In the twenty-first century, however, the situation changed again, Schumacher said. As manufacturing grew more automated, and advances in artificial intelligence promised a “man–machine symbiosis” on the horizon, democracy no longer made sense. It was an antique ideology, an artifact of an earlier, superseded moment in the history of capitalism—a dumbly literal reading of the world map, as if everything were penned inside its colored containers. What made sense in the twenty-first century were dots on the map like Liberland: blank-slate enclaves that could be anchor points for virtual enterprises, getaways for the global elite, or new citadels of financial services, marketing, design, software engineering, and other lines of work that needed little more than an electrical outlet and a robust internet connection.

- Special economic zones on islands of the Philippines; fishery zones off leased islands near Papua New Guinea; an economic development zone along the railway in Cambodia; a proposal to build a rival to the Panama Canal through Nicaragua—despite all the talk of “deglobalization,” China seems to be continuing with many of the familiar techniques of the last half century.25 Its vision is of corridors—seaways, highways, and railways—linking nodes of capitalism across borders.

- In 2017, Saudi Arabia, under Ottoman rule until the 1920s, announced a spectacular extraterritorial zone near the Jordanian and Egyptian border: a $500 billion megaproject called NEOM with backing from some of the world’s biggest investors.28 Planned from scratch, NEOM is intended to cover over ten thousand square miles of desert and Red Sea coastline. The plans include a “linear city” with a pair of twin skyscrapers to stretch horizontally for dozens of miles, billed as “the largest buildings ever constructed.”29 The scheme is not only a feat of architecture and engineering (and, arguably, magical thinking when it comes to water procurement) but also a laboratory of private government. It is to be run by shareholders rather than the Saudi state—“an autonomous government whose laws will be chartered by investors.”30 Shares are to be sold on the Saudi stock exchange. The only obligation of the NEOM board of directors would be protecting the shareholders’ investment. The Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has called it “the first zone floated in the public markets” and “the first capitalist city in the world.” ([Location 4420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Y45HDC9&location=4420))
- In a country where about a third of the residents are expats, there was a public relations blitz around the granting of Saudi citizenship to a humanoid robot—the first time in the world a machine received legal personhood.34 Her name was Sophia, she wore a power suit, and she was bald, presumably as a way around the Saudi norm of women not showing their hair in public.

- A different kind of zone that recurs in climate discussions is the idea of the sacrifice zone, an area where human settlements are abandoned to sea-level rise. Globally, new forms of inequality are already coming into focus, as poorer communities are designated as sacrifice zones and enter “managed retreat” while richer areas begin to plan for seawalls, berms, dikes, and other forms of containment.

- No matter the rhetoric, zones are tools of the state, not liberation from it. No matter the exit fantasies, zones cannot escape the earth.
