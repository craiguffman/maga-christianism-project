- Gospel is Paul’s shorthand for what he thought God was up to when God sent Jesus to enter our human situation to save us in some sense. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=225))

- “Paulus” means “small” in Latin—or, a little more poetically, “humble”—so it was almost certainly Paul’s cognomen. He would have been known everywhere in non-Jewish circles as “Tiny.” ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=251))

- The great Roman general Pompey, Julius Caesar’s contemporary, had enslaved tens of thousands of Jews when he annexed Galilee and Judea in 65 BCE and taken many of them to Rome. Paul could easily have been a descendant of the survivors of some of these unfortunate Jews. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=257))

- It is more likely that he was a canvas worker, which this word could describe at a pinch. Mediterranean cities get very hot. Shops and stadiums in Paul’s day used canvas awnings to provide shelter from the sun, as well as from the occasional cloudburst.

- Paul probably stitched canvas awnings for a living when he had to, carrying his tools around with him in a small pouch—an awl, a knife, thread, and some thick metal needles. To ancient eyes he wouldn’t have looked like much. The small but hugely influential upper class despised people who had to work with their hands for a living because they looked like slaves. Artisans like Paul were very low down in the pecking order. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=269))

- He had been conducting the ancient equivalent of police sweeps in Jerusalem and the surrounding region of Judea, and we shouldn’t sugarcoat this: Paul was the leader of a death squad. Such was his zeal, he wanted to pursue these deviants wherever they had fled, even to foreign cities. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=279))

- Both the Father and Jesus are confessed as creating, which was an activity that the Jewish Scriptures attributed solidly and consistently to God alone. To make matters worse, the sacred name for God, which was so holy that Jews did not even speak it but hid it behind the word “Lord,” is being attached here to Jesus. So clearly Jesus is God. But Paul is not splitting God into one God and then another Lord, Jesus, who is also a God. There is one God and one Lord, who are on some level the same thing. The conclusion is inescapable that Paul is stating here—quite calmly, and apparently in a way that all the Corinthians were fully comfortable with—that the one God who cannot be imaged and who made the heavens and the earth includes Jesus within his identity. Two figures are visible here within the one God, ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=304))

- conversation, a blog, a tweet, a badly written child’s essay, a boring lecture, or a conversation. It doesn’t matter. The claims being made are only understood to be true when the Spirit reveals them to be so. “God has revealed [his secret] to us by his Spirit,” Paul observes. Hence “we have received the Spirit who is from God that we may understand what God has freely given us” (1 Cor. 2:10, 12, ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=314))

- It seems then that the Corinthians didn’t work all this out for themselves. They responded to the promptings of God by way of his Spirit. It was this revelation in their hearts and minds that introduced certainty about the truth of the information they were hearing by way of Paul’s unimpressive words. Because of this deep work of conviction, the human messenger doesn’t matter so much, Paul says, and a highly stylish messenger might even detract from the information’s truth because she or he would draw our attention away from the Spirit who is doing the important underlying work.

- We can now see two revelations working together whenever God is being revealed and understood. There is Jesus, and there is the Spirit. These two figures operate like the two hands of God gathering people up and bringing them back to the Father. Presumably this is what happened to Paul near Damascus as well. He was touched by both the Lord Jesus and by God’s Spirit. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=322))

- He was a learned Jew, he says in Galatians 1:14, and so dedicated, he says in the previous verse, that he was persecuting religious deviants.7 But he was heading in the completely wrong direction and God changed him by breaking into his life, the chapter continues.

- Fortunately, Paul thinks about it this way as well. In a telling passage written to his converts in the ancient city of Philippi, he speaks of the extraordinary reevaluation that the arrival of Christ imposed on his life. If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless. But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him. . . . (Phil. 3:4b–9a, ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=357))

- But now, in the light of Christ, looking back on this previous life, he counts everything that previously seemed to be a gain as a loss. In comparison to Christ these things are not absolutely negative in and of themselves but, just so we don’t miss the point, in relation to Christ he says that these badges of pride and gold medal activities are tantamount to excrement (Greek skybala).

- Let us suppose that I have just made it through a successful rehab program. Supported by a generous and honest community, a local meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, I have beaten my habit—although, as experienced AA members would say, only for now. One of the most striking features of my recovery is my new ability to tell a truthful story about my past struggles. I now begin my story confessionally, with the acknowledgment that I am at present free, although I can see that in and of myself I am an addict. Then I recount my tragic former biography in these terms—how I fought a long battle with drugs, say, with heroin. I describe how heroin effectively controlled me, leading to deeply destructive and tragic activity. Because of the constant need to find money to buy a hit, I damaged all my close relationships, lying to and stealing from those I loved. Fortunately, because of the twelve-step program, the support and penetrating honesty of my buddy and my group, and a long period of time with my mind free of the abusive substance itself, I am seeking to rebuild the trust within the important relationships I have damaged. I am beginning to see things clearly, as they really took place. But I did not tell this story prior to entering rehab, when I was in the grip of my habit. Then I spoke very differently. I never said at that time, in the full throes of addiction, that I was an addict, out of control, and enslaved. I said the very opposite. “I am in control of my drug-taking and doing just what I want.” Then I would add, “In fact I’m having the best time of my life. No one is getting badly hurt by my behavior. It’s just harmless fun. And I can give it up any time I want to. I’m not like those addicts over there.” With a mind clarified by… ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=379))

- the clarification that Augustine experienced as his mind was cleansed, and the resulting need to redescribe the events that led up to his conversion and ministry—to provide an explicitly retrospective but far more accurate account of his past, of his conversion, and of his underlying nature.

- Paul is refreshingly honest about his mistakes. Prior to the revelation of Christ to him on the road to Damascus, Paul was a deeply devout servant of God but, as we already know, he understood that as a readiness to kill the followers of Jesus. But the revelation of God in the person of Jesus revealed in the same moment the utter, total, and complete misdirection of his zeal. Instead of accelerating ahead of the pious crowd, winning the race for Jewish virtue, Paul was deeply and profoundly mistaken about God, God’s nature, and God’s purposes—so much so that he was zealously opposing God, fighting against the very God he thought that he was serving. From this event onward, Paul’s story changes dramatically, including his account of his past. The zealous Pharisee is a zealous misdirected Pharisee.

- He was able to look back on his previous life with a mind clarified by this revelation and see where his previous activity, which looked entirely reasonable if not praiseworthy at the time, was profoundly distorted. Moreover, the story he now tells retrospectively, after the fact, is the correct one. It is the story clarified by the gift of truth in Jesus. “Whatever I previously considered gain or advantageous, I now consider, in the light of Christ and in comparison to him, loss. Indeed, compared with the surpassing wonder of Christ I consider everything as mere excrement!” (Phil. 3:6–7). Every story that we tell about what precedes the arrival of Jesus up to that arrival needs to be told in this way. Moreover, we need to cleave to this practice faithfully because of the subtle traps that lurk here for the unwary. We Christians must learn to craft our stories backward, and in a confessional mode, like the testimony of the addict emerging from addiction. This is how the mature Augustine spoke, and how Paul himself learned to speak several centuries before him. We must, as Paul himself put it, bring every thought captive to Christ (2 Cor. 10:5b).

- Readers of Paul sometimes think that when he said that he went into “Arabia” in Galatians 1:17 he was going into a long period of desert retreat while he thought about what had just happened to him. But Arabia was a name given in Paul’s day to the regions that lay to the south of Damascus down the King’s Highway, which was the age-old road that ran through this area on the way from Babylon to Egypt. Arabia contained a group of Hellenistic cities known as the Decapolis—“the ten cities” (although there were actually more than ten)—and the kingdom of Nabataea, whose capital was in the magnificent fastness of Petra. (Indiana Jones finished his last crusade there.) It was an area filled with cities and packed with pagans, so when Paul says that he immediately went to Arabia, it’s pretty likely that he was doing what God had told him to do. He was taking the good news of Jesus to the pagan nations. The pagans in the Decapolis and Nabataea were the most accessible pagans he had.13 ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=437))

- There was clearly something special about what Paul was appointed by God to do. He was an apostle. Apostles are basically missionaries. They take the good news of Jesus cross-culturally, and there are many challenges in this job that they must be especially gifted and skilled to navigate. I don’t think we are all called to be apostles. But we are all called. This means we all have a job to do and that job will most likely involve a constituency. The famous little tract “The Four Spiritual Laws” begins: “God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.”14 This is exactly right. A recent Christian bestseller that has sold thirty million copies is titled The Purpose Driven Life.15 God is all about purpose, and purpose specifically for us. We have all been set apart from our mother’s womb for something. But what Paul’s statement in Galatians 1 tells us is that these purposes will be bound up with a constituency. We will be sent in some sense to people, and those people might not be the ones we expect. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=445))

- He went from Damascus down southward to what is present-day Jordan and back trying to make converts from among the pagans as God had instructed him to. However, he seems to have been trying at this time to attract pagans who were already drawn to Judaism—an interesting group of people the book of Acts calls “God-fearers,” although this is probably better translated “God-worshipers,” meaning by this phrase “worshipers of the one true God [and not the disgusting pagan idols].” ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=469))

- We learned in the previous chapter that Paul was quite unashamed of declaring that Jesus was Lord, and proclaimed him in terms drawn from the heart of Jewish theology, Deuteronomy 6:4. So Jesus was God. The Holy Spirit was invoked a great deal as well. This resulted in a startlingly early anticipation of later Trinitarian doctrine. God was three-in-one: God the Father, as Paul called him, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Doubtless a lot of Jews in the areas in which Paul was preaching found this highly offensive.

- After the battle he could annex the rich prize that was Damascus, which had been controlled for a time by his predecessor, Aretas III. While this was good luck for—or good planning by—Aretas IV, it was bad luck for Paul. Paul had previously been safe from any Jews he had antagonized in Nabataea, and there were a lot of Jews living there at this time. He could, in effect, flee over state lines. If angry Jews wanted to catch and discipline him, he was safe as soon as he reached his home city of Damascus, which was an independent city. But when it fell under King Aretas’s control, his enemies in Nabataea could reach him, and presumably they did it in the usual way, by bribing an official to do what they wanted. The new governor of Damascus, an appointee of Aretas, duly used his forces to try to catch Paul, ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=524))

Galatians tells us that he visited Jerusalem for an important meeting in late 49 CE,5 “thirteen plus years later,” writing his letter to the Galatians shortly thereafter, and these data give us the big frame on which we will hang all the other events in Paul’s life.

- They had long integrated many of these practices into their homes as well, combining worship, meals, and prayers. The early followers of Jesus emphasized these activities as well but with modifications. Their central ritual, the Lord’s Supper or Eucharist, took place during a meal. The bread for the meal was broken beforehand and shared out with the appropriate words of remembrance about Jesus. The cup of wine was drunk at the end and passed around in the same ritual way. The meal was then followed by the appropriate religious entertainment, as opposed to the usual pagan fare, and this seems to have meant worship in a style modern Christians would identify as Pentecostal or charismatic. When Paul describes one of these gatherings in Corinth he says that people brought songs to the meeting that they had composed. During the gathering they spoke in tongues, prophesied, and prayed for miracles, healings, and deliverance. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=594))

- The Spirit of God who had raised Jesus from the dead and would raise his Jewish followers was stating here that non-Jewish followers of Jesus would inherit the Age to Come as well. So far so good, although Paul probably already knew this. This situation at Antioch suggested, however, that they do so without adopting all the practices of the Jews. God had clearly accepted them just where they were—as uncircumcised God-worshipers, to focus on the men for a moment. But how could God be accepting pagans without making them Jews first? This would be like God accepting pagans today without asking them to join the church. What had just happened to Israel and to the central story of the Jewish Scriptures?! Yet this is what had plainly happened. Shocking. Incomprehensible—and clearly in some way part of the divine plan.

They are raised with Jesus as they stand up and receive their new clothing. Moreover, this is not just symbolic.

Moreover, “the mind of the Spirit is life and peace,” displacing the corruption and conflict of one’s old mind, Paul says in Romans 8:6.

He has done so if the new reality that the resurrected converts live out of lies beyond many of the structures that characterize the present age—and this is what he often claims. Paul’s most famous such assertion is Galatians 3:28, which is best read along with its two preceding verses. This text has rightly been called the Pauline Magna Carta.

Incidentally, this… ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=672))
- He saw very clearly that Jesus’s resurrection is a victory over death and has effected his entrance into heaven and therefore, in a sense, into the Age to Come. This means that life in the Age to Come must transcend our mortality. This means in turn that it must leave behind almost all of our present structures and forms, which frequently are bound up with death. Our means of reproduction, for example, is a way of ensuring life in spite of death. The Bible is pretty clear about this. Adam “knows” Eve and calls her “life” after the fall, and the difficulty of this imperfect arrangement is acknowledged in the pain and struggle of childbirth. Fortunately, in the Age to Come it will be redundant. But this means that our biology, our gender, will be redundant. Our bodies will be very different. This is why celibacy reflects the Age to Come more than marriage. It follows that food will be transcended as well—stomachs will be as redundant as sexual organs—so the Jewish rules about food don’t need to be taken too seriously. This is why Paul can say, The Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of deliverance and peace and joy through the Holy Spirit. (Rom. 14:17) ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=681))
- But if we grant for the moment that Paul is latching onto something true and real, they do make sense of why converts to the Lord Jesus from paganism did not need to take up a Jewish ethic. The customs comprising that ethic were rooted in the structures of the present age—food, drink, clothing, land, marriage, and so on. Jews had specific customs and habits here. But converts to Jesus have died and been resurrected into a new age altogether. They are living not so much in Judaism as in the fulfillment of Judaism; they live not as Jews but as the people the Jews are waiting to become. They get direct access to the Age to Come where these former things no longer matter and, as we have already noted, the glories of this Age make all the structures and practices of the present age look like dung. It is that much better. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=693))
- Why attach leeches to a child’s leg in the hope that she can be cured of cancer when a program of radiation treatment at the local hospital has 100 percent success rate for this particular form? This is how Paul views things. Living out of the Age to Come instead of the present Age? No contest! But whatever was to my gain—these things—I consider a loss for the sake of Christ. Moreover, I consider everything to be a loss for the sake of the surpassing wonderfulness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom everything has become a loss, and I consider them excrement so that I might gain Christ and be found in him! (Phil. 3:7–9a) ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=701))
- Paul thinks that converts basically live in two worlds at the same time. They still live in the world that he calls “the Flesh,” and Paul spends most of his letters battling fleshly actions by his converts. We see this world beckoning his readers in Romans chapter 7. But they also live in the new age, the age of the Spirit. We see the transition to this world being laid out in Romans 6 and the dynamics of this world being articulated in Romans 8. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=712))
- The spiritual world is revealed by the Spirit and is only accessible to those attuned to that dimension. Paul “knows” and “believes” it is there. However, this is the world that ultimately matters because it is the world of life. It will last. So Paul counsels the Corinthians at one point, “fix your eyes on what is not visible, not on what is visible, because the visible is temporary, but the invisible is permanent” (2 Cor. 4:18). ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=716))
- But these difficulties can be resolved if we switch metaphors. Let’s think about this situation sonically, using music, with our ears, instead of optically, visually, and with our eyes. Reality is musical. This will enable us to think about things in ways that are both more accurate and not necessarily mutually exclusive.18 Imagine that I have just heard this challenge from a smart student in a classroom: “How can even part of us be resurrected in the Spirit, with one foot in the Age to Come, when we are so obviously still caught up in the world of the Flesh?” Instead of responding with some elaborate argument about false Newtonian dualisms or some such, I click on a link and start to play a song by Zao through the classroom’s loudspeakers. I crank up the volume a bit. “Praise the War Machine” floods the seminar space—the music (with due apologies to death metal rock music) of the Flesh. “We shall destroy the earth. Rebuild it. None shall inherit it.” Then, while Zao is in full voice, I take my iPhone and flick to Bach’s Air on a G String and begin to play it—quite softly. I can just catch the delicate resonances of the strings as they move through their interlacements of pizzicato and bowing—the music of heaven (at least, for those who love Bach). Then I begin to slowly turn down the volume on Zao. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=731))
- There is nowhere in the room that lacks the music of both pieces. Every single part of the space that we occupy together is touched by Zao and by Bach at any given moment. Both pieces of music were fully present, within and alongside one another, and yet completely distinct from one another. Moreover, even when the volume of one piece was so high that the other was drowned out, we knew that the music was still there. Both pieces were present, but we couldn’t hear one because our senses were dominated by the other arrangement. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=744))
- In short, the resurrected mind of the Spirit can coexist quietly in, behind, and within the jarring music of the Flesh. So to affirm the presence of the resurrected mind is by no means to deny the ongoing presence of the Flesh, of sin, and of death. Paul’s basic claim that converts to Christ possess the resurrected mind of Christ remains plausible as long as we remember that reality is musical. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=754))
- Paul has a new theology, a new account of Christian behavior, and consequently has a new missionary approach as well. Just as his converts no longer have to act like Jews, he no longer needs to find his converts hanging around with Jews. He is not limited to the synagogues or to Jewish hosts anymore, and given how they were frequently reacting to him this was probably a good thing. Nor does Paul himself have to respect Jewish practices quite so much. If he is called to do so he can sit lightly to the Jewish rules guiding his eating and resting and visiting. The result of this is flexibility. Paul can enter social spaces that he couldn’t previously. He can boldly go where no Jew has gone before. And this is just what he did.

- One of the most telling moments for me in the book of Acts is the command given by the Holy Spirit in 13:2. Acts 13:1 states that the important community at Antioch was busy serving the Lord and fasting. Acts gives some details about its leaders, whom it calls prophets and teachers. A delightful diversity is evident within their broadly Jewish identity: Barnabas was a Jew from the island of Cyprus who had a priestly lineage; Simeon was nicknamed “Black” and came from Africa; Lucius, who came from Cyrene, which is modern-day Libya, had a Roman forename, so he was a Roman citizen like Paul; a companion raised with Herod Antipas called Manaen was a Jewish aristocrat; and Paul. All of this sounds a bit like a bad joke: “A priest, an African, a Roman, an aristocrat, and a Pharisee all walked into a pub. The priest said to the African . . .” But in 13:2 the Holy Spirit issues an explicit command: “Set apart Barnabas and Saul for me for the work that I have called them to.” So the priest and the Pharisee turned around and went out the door as they had been commanded, leaving the African, the Roman, and the aristocrat behind.

- This is noteworthy because the governors of provinces run by the senate, which included Cyprus, were drawn from the uppermost echelons of Roman society.

- obscure? The recent excavations of Pisidian Antioch have yielded a fascinating answer. A series of inscriptions have been found there. Inscriptions were a bit like the advertisements of the ancient world although the analogy is not exact; they doubled as political campaign slogans and civic acknowledgments of key donors. They placed the names of important people up in lights. The inscriptions in Pisidian Antioch reveal that one of the dominant families in the little town was the Sergi Pauli.

- Paul and Barnabas traveled from Antioch to Salamis on Cyprus, Barnabas’s homeland. This was a family network within a broader Jewish network. Sergius Paulus’s conversion is unusual because it was so dramatic and sudden—a direct work of the Holy Spirit. But once that conversion had been made, Paul traveled to Pisidian Antioch exploring his family network, although this time of an out-and-out pagan family. And Paul’s later letter to the Galatians suggests that more than just family members converted in Pisidian Antioch. Whole households turned to Jesus (see Gal. 6:10). Households in the ancient world, especially wealthy ones, contained more than immediate families. They were full of relatives, friends, retainers, and slaves. The household of a wealthy upper-class Roman also anchored a network of clients spreading out from their immediate area to other dependent households in their cities and to their country estates—their patronage network. Clearly Paul worked… ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=926))
- He was prepared to hang out in unexpected places, and he couldn’t do this—or couldn’t do it as easily and constantly—before the breakthrough in Antioch, when he was observing Jewish practices vigilantly. Jews cannot eat and drink with people all the time, and they have scheduling clashes, while various pagan social spaces are downright problematic. Jews don’t want to be too exposed to pagan idols, or to corpses, thereby incurring corpse impurity, or to eat food with blood in it. Paul’s new flexibility with respect to food, drink, and timetabling meant he could access new social spaces without these impediments. Unexpected places offered strange new friendships, and these friendships could be with anyone, whether someone of high status like Sergius Paulus, or of low status, like Lydia. No one was too important or too unimportant to talk to and to befriend. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=938))
- Paul had no idea when he sailed to Cyprus that he would be dragged before the governor and then led to strike his deceptive sorcerer blind. But this is what happened. The Spirit thereby opened up this aristocratic Roman’s familial and patronage networks suddenly and directly. What people sometimes refer to as “the first missionary journey” in the book of Acts, which looped from Cyprus up through central Turkey and back, derived almost entirely from this dramatic event and Paul’s subsequent movement through the new set of networks it accessed. Paul had to be prepared to travel to Cyprus, obviously, and to stand trial before the governor, for all this to happen.

- So four primary networks are detectable at this moment in Paul’s missionary work: familial, Jewish, artisanal, and patronal.

- There is plenty of evidence that Paul loved the Thessalonians, grounding their relationship in a deep friendship. Deep friendships are relationships of love. He gives thanks for them and prays for them continually (1:2–3; see also 5:17–18), naming their virtues of affection, endurance, and hope. He and his co-workers originally labored among them with their hands “night and day” when the community was founded because its people “had become beloved to us” (2:8). The missionaries were as gentle as a mother suckling her own infants (2:7); and they encouraged, comforted, and exhorted them like a father his children (2:11–12). Paul has been so concerned for their welfare since he left the city that he has sent Timothy back on what was possibly a dangerous mission to report about them (3:1–5). On Timothy’s return with the good news concerning their loyalty and longing he is so overjoyed that he triples the number of thanksgiving sections he normally supplies in letters, writing three instead of the usual one (3:6–10; see also 1:2–10 and 2:13).

A professional like him could demand to be paid a speaking fee. His rivals did. But he didn’t.

- A loving person will trust God, and other people where this is warranted. They need not be naïve, but neither should they be needlessly cynical or suspicious. In part this trust will be oriented toward the future. There will be an expectation of promises fulfilled and good things over the horizon—an attitude of hope. To live as love and within love is to be happy, although to be happy in a deep and profound way, not in a superficial fizzy one. We can speak here of joy. It is also to be fundamentally at peace with God and the cosmos, and to work for peace where people are disrupting and sabotaging this. Love is restorative. People who love respond in particular ways to those who are misbehaving or struggling. They are patient and kind. They are giving when this is needful, and they are generous with their time and resources. They are not violent or coercive, actions that violate loving relationality at a very fundamental level.

God meets us within people and through people. (God is not reducible to people, but they mediate him, assisted by the Spirit.) The best way to make sense of this is to grasp that persons are not relational in a static manner in the sense that this is what they are and they stay this way, fixed in place like a wire basket.

The $64,000 question is not, should we should have elites? but what sort of elites should we have?

He expects his Thessalonian converts to imitate him and his co-leaders. “You became imitators of us and of the Lord,” he says at the start of the letter (1 Thess. 1:6). This imitation is expanded as Paul elaborates on what sort of person he is, which he does by elaborating on how he has been relating to them—praying for them, thanking God for them, being dedicated to them, being loyal and faithful, working hard for his own living, being gentle and caring, admonishing, encouraging, and longing to see them.

- Slave-traders were basically pirates who raided ashore and kidnapped people to sell as slaves. Some would capture people from the shores of the Black Sea and sell them, often in Ephesus, as “Scythians,” and sometimes slaves even received that name. Paul is hinting here, then, that Handy was originally a white barbarian captured to the north of the Black Sea—in modern terms, a white Ukrainian slave. Clues in the prescript of the letter to Philemon suggest that his master, Philemon, was a Phrygian. This was a barbarian lineage too, but an ancient race located in the Colossian area and long civilized by Greek customs. Two axes of tension are detectable, then, in the relationship between Philemon and Handy: one is a master and the other a slave; and one is a Phrygian and the other a Scythian—in modern terms, a Turk and a Ukrainian. Furthermore, as was common in deeply hierarchical and exploitative societies, Handy is dragging his feet. He is an unwilling, lazy worker and possibly given to a bit of pilfering as well. Beatings and the threat of reprisals have probably caused him to flee to Paul for help. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=1463))

Those who are responding to this generous gift are lifted from their old sinful existence that is destined for death into a new relational life. They are resurrected in Jesus, something they experience now as having a resurrected mind. Paul therefore expects the behavior of his converts to change, especially in terms of how they relate to one another. They are to be loving, kind, and appropriate in speech, as well as sexually disciplined. They will learn this behavior in a quite practical way by following their divinely appointed leaders who have been gifted by God in various helpful ways as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and teachers.

The new situation gifted in Jesus transcends this enmity; it is characterized by peace. However, the community is being attacked constantly by the evil forces who oppose God’s cosmic plan, and it is called to stand firm in this fierce spiritual battle. If this agenda apparent in Ephesians is basically the same as the system we have already reconstructed from Paul’s activities in Damascus, Antioch, Galatia, and Macedonia, we might ask if anything is different—other, that is, than being laid out more fully.

- Ephesians stands strongly against this approach. It begins the story about God, humanity, and the gospel with God, specifically, with God’s plan from “before” the foundation of the cosmos—“before” because there is no strict temporal before when time doesn’t exist. God’s plan was always to adopt us as children in his beloved Son Jesus. This has been a cosmic secret until its revelation now in the gospel, so the secret is finally out. But we don’t understand this secret without the arrival of Jesus. He is the secret. So we can’t work out the most important things about the meaning of the cosmos before the gospel arrives by beginning with our own situations. Proceeding in this way would miss the most important thing, which is responding to Jesus as we have been destined to. We must proceed in a Christ-centered way or Christocentrically, which is what Ephesians does. Christ is the key to the cosmos. This is where Paul’s theological story begins.

That God is fully present in a group gathering in a home suggests that God is not simply to be found in the Jerusalem temple, there to be approached by one person once a year, in the Holy of Holies, in a state of rigorous purity. An extraordinary geographical decentralization of God’s presence has taken place. His followers no longer have to travel to Jerusalem to meet with him. They can travel out to those who do not yet know him, carrying his presence with them, rather as the children of Israel first carried God’s presence with them through the wilderness of Sinai in the tabernacle. Moreover, if this is the case, communities no longer have to invest in capital-heavy projects to try to ensure that God will show up. Large buildings were redundant—a big change for Jews and pagans.

- Paul points out at the beginning of 1 Corinthians at length—returning to the theme at many later points in the rest of the letter—that this is a fundamental betrayal of Christian community. Christians are to love, support, and encourage one another, not compete with one another; and their leaders are to follow in the footsteps of the crucified Christ. The leader who reaches down to live alongside people, and who values and engages with the poor and the marginalized, is the true Christian leader. This is the “appearance” that matters.

- In a larger, more diverse church like Corinth, Paul’s ethic of kindness faced much tougher challenges. It had to overcome deep divisions of race, class, and gender present within the fabric of the community. However, it is at this exact moment that we see both the importance of Christian leadership and its true nature. Christian leaders can manage and heal these divisions, provided they act appropriately. They are to humble themselves and to bridge existing social chasms of race, class, and gender, thereby drawing the community together behind them. But this type of leadership is deeply countercultural. It is hard even to recognize, while cultural accounts of leadership in terms of status, wealth, and influence directly undermine this authentic account. Such are the challenges of true Christian leadership, and the impossibility of true Christian community without it!

- In a second problematic act of intellectualism, this group is pushing another maxim to extremes. “Idols don’t actually exist,” as the Bible repeatedly says, so there are really no problems with attending idol feasts and worship events. It is not as if anything is actually there! In this way, the puffed up, as Paul calls them, could continue to attend the plethora of idolatrous events that structured the ancient pagan city—its processions, feasts, festivals, and sacrifices. To deal with this problem Paul reintroduces the relationality and connectedness that these figures seem to keep overlooking. Idols aren’t anything, but these pagan events are intertwined with the evil powers that roam the cosmos outside the church. Pagan culture might not be what it says it is, but it is still dangerous, and attending an idolatrous worship event is creating a foolish vulnerability to evil, as well as being deeply unfaithful to God. Can we really attend a black Sabbath and escape unscathed? Can we walk in a national parade, without thinking that a nation, a flag, or a history “is anything”? Paul instructs these particular Corinthians not to play with fire (1 Cor. 10:1–22). ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=1917))

- First, Paul’s ethic of Christian love was deeply countercultural and highly demanding. Homogeneous and idealized communities mask how tough it is to practice this kindness and consideration across social divisions where it needs to bridge and heal and not merely to fit into a group that already gets along quite well.

- Second, it is clear that local Christian leadership is critical to this process, and this leadership has to be formed on Christ’s leadership, modeled by Paul and his students. Conventional assessments of value must be abandoned. Conventional competitive relations must be repented of. This recalibration of what an authentic leader looks like is so important to the health of the community and so difficult. Every community has elites, and invariably throughout history those elites have contested for status in terms of conventional markers. Paul is challenging the Corinthians and us to do things very differently. The deeply countercultural challenge of Christian behavior is exposed by Corinth here again, and it reveals as no other community does the need for good leaders if a diverse Christian community is to move forward.

- bodies, so everything they do is important. In sum, the Christian way is fairly simple in theory. It asks all its followers to be kind and considerate toward one another. It asks its leaders to be sensitive to “the least of these,” if necessary, living alongside them. But this is incredibly demanding in practice. These are deeply countercultural dynamics. If they are to take root, above all they require leaders, and the right sort of leadership. Christian leaders must help their communities to navigate their current locations ethically with due depth, sensitivity, and courage—something we will learn a lot more about momentarily.

- Some of the Corinthians were being too theologically aggressive. In chapters 5 and 6 of 1 Corinthians Paul addresses the way this aggression has led to sexually damaging behavior. Paul had taught the community that the Jewish food rules didn’t matter anymore. The Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of deliverance and peace and joy through the Holy Spirit. (Rom. 14:17) Another way of putting this would be to say “food for the stomach and the stomach for food” (1 Cor. 6:13). It goes in, it comes out, and has no religious significance. Who cares what we eat, where, or how? But what happens if we apply this adage to the penis? “The penis for sex and sex for the penis.” Who cares with whom we have sex, where, or how?

- This may not be quite as shocking as it first seems. In the ancient world, women were married at or just before puberty, perhaps as young as twelve then, and often to much older men who had lost their first wives. If a woman’s original husband had died, a stepson from a first marriage could have been older than his stepmother (although we don’t know if the husband/father had died; the adage would apply whether he was alive or dead). And we can see now how the motto “the penis for sex and sex for the penis” underwrites this instance of incest, and the Corinthians who came up with this revolutionary practice are even quite proud of themselves for doing so!

- Previously we had too much sex going on. Now, in chapter 7, we have too little. Some women are refusing to have sex with their husbands on spiritual grounds. “It’s good for a woman not to be contacted sexually by a man,” they are saying (7:1).

- marriage is between a man and a woman, as the Bible says right at the start, in Genesis 1–3. There are some important additional biblical rules, however. The relationship must not be incestuous. The book of Leviticus defines this. All cultures have a strong incest taboo—it is part of basic human programming—but all cultures define incest at its boundaries slightly differently. Leviticus clears this up for Paul as it does for other Jews. Moreover, marriage is to be enduring and faithful. Paul quotes a rule from Jesus here (see Mark 10:2–12). The results of this modified Jewish pattern? No sleeping around, no prostitution, and no incest. But within this arrangement partners should have sex and try to procreate, so no ongoing asceticism for the married either, and no divorce. A fundamentally Jewish view of sex and gender holds all these different instructions together. Finally, marriages are constructed in an orderly, hierarchical fashion.

- Who knows how long some couples at Corinth might have been engaged to marry but put that happy event on hold because of Paul’s stay-where-you-are law? A young couple in love might have converted when Paul first arrived in Corinth in 41 CE, and be grimly hanging on, betrothed but in an unconsummated relationship, ten years later, in 51! Clearly the tensions were beginning to build. ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2033))

- A standard feature of marriages, universally observable cross-culturally, is that many of the men and women who pair up, and usually have children, get unhappy over time and part. Around a third of marriages dissolve (speaking very generally). A common rule of thumb is at the four-year mark, which is when infants first reach a level of viability, and culturally this results in the phenomenon of divorce.3 Time has passed at Corinth, and so some couples are moving in this direction too, including Christian marriages, in which both partners were Christian, and mixed marriages, in which only one person was a Christian. ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2040))
- But when it comes to mixed couples comprising a marriage between a Christian and a pagan, Paul counsels flexibility. Apparently, strict marriage rules apply strictly only to those within the community. The stay-where-you-are rule doesn’t apply so firmly either. Spouses in mixed marriages are “called to peace” and are allowed to figure out what will work best on quite pragmatic grounds, taking due account of any children. They should navigate forward through the specifics of the situation in a way that will result in maximum harmony relationally, changing their situation and their roles if they have to, that is, not staying where they are if this is the best thing to do. ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2048))
- Underlying all Paul’s advice is a traditional Jewish framework: marriage is between a man and a woman, for life, provided they are not too closely related to one another. Anything outside this arrangement is aberrant and to be prohibited. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2057))

- In Paul’s day chaste women wore a headscarf called a pulla rather as women in Pakistan today wear the dupatta. It covered the head, shoulders, and neck, not the face, as the more comprehensive Iranian burqa does. Women also wore their hair neatly coiffed. It was plaited and arranged, held in place with pins, and wealthy women had particularly elaborate configurations. Only lengthy attention from dedicated slaves could produce these, so they signaled the status of their wearers instantly as much as large diamonds and Gucci bags do today. The latest hairstyles were circulated and copied from the picture of the Roman Empress stamped on coins—the ancient equivalent of Vogue. ([Location 2072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2072))
- Conversely, women who were losing their clothing and had bedraggled hair were acting like maenads. In ancient Greek culture maenads were the female followers of the god Dionysus, known literally as “raving ones.” (Dionysos was an exuberant partying god.) They were drunk and on the loose! ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2077))
- Any husbands in the room at Corinth were being horribly humiliated by the abandoned behavior of their wives. Paul tries to rein this in in 11:2–16 by appealing to the story of Adam and Eve. Adam got made first, so he is in charge. It’s not a great argument, but we’ll worry about that some other time. The key point for now is the realization that here Paul is allowing the women to continue to speak in tongues. However, they must do so in a way that does not shame their husbands. Perhaps think then of a modern pastor asking women who are speaking in tongues in church so vigorously that their blouses are slipping off to do so in a more restrained way. It’s reasonable. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2079))
- But someone might ask if this is really the case when Paul famously forbids women to speak at all in 14:33–36. Paul’s short aside here has been widely represented as a command that women should be silent in the congregation period. But this isn’t what he is saying. As we have just seen in 1 Corinthians 11:2–16, and as we read at length in 1 Corinthians 14, women are fully entitled to speak through the Spirit in tongues or in prophecy. It’s just that they are not to question and to interrupt other people speaking in church. They are not to interrogate the preacher. Consequently, Paul never silences women in church altogether. Far from it. He silences those sitting in the pews. So in fact most churches today have followed this advice to the letter—although most of the men must now remain silent as well!

- The book of Acts tells us about three dramatic episodes that led to some stunning successes but ended up with Paul having to run for his life (Acts 19:8–41). ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2113))
- The drama began when an exorcism at Ephesus went wrong (Acts 19:13–16). Some Jewish exorcists were involved with a particularly difficult case. A demon was refusing to leave a man, so in a fit of desperation the magicians abjured the demon to leave “in the name of Jesus whom Paul proclaims.” This proved to be a mistake. The demon responded, “I know Jesus and I know Paul but I don’t know who you are!” He leaped up and beat them, chasing them naked and bleeding down the main street. Naturally, everyone heard about this. It was the talk of the town, and it made Paul famous. But why? ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2114))
- Most people in Paul’s day lived in a world that they believed was densely populated with invisible spiritual beings, and many of these were capricious and malevolent. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2119))
- The demon the Jewish magicians were trying to cast out was so strong that he overcame seven grown men. When he said “I know Jesus and I know Paul,” he was saying in spirit-talk that he respected Jesus and Paul. The word in Greek suggests that he “acknowledges” Jesus. He was admitting that if Paul had been present, commanding him in the name of Jesus to leave, he would have had to go. But the group of seven magicians lacked the power to get him to do anything. That an enormously powerful demon capable of beating seven men, speaking from the spirit world, had acknowledged the authority of Jesus and of his servant, Paul, did not just impress a great mass of Ephesians; it struck fear into them. Huge numbers converted. ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2125))
- The Ephesians brought their magic scrolls and spells and burned them in a great bonfire in the street (Acts 19:17–19). Acts suggests that the pile of material might have cost, in today’s terms, as much as six million dollars. (It was fifty thousand times the daily wage of a skilled laborer.) Even if the author is exaggerating a little, this is a huge sum of money being incinerated. Paul had made an impact! Try to imagine something similar happening in your town one day. The main street would be closed as six million dollars’ worth of porn videos, computer games, and insurance policies went up in smoke. That would make CNN. The bonfire also tells us something interesting about the things Paul was preaching. ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2131))
- The Ephesians were burning their magical scrolls because they no longer needed them. They were now being protected from demons and curses by the God revealed in Jesus for free. He was clearly an extremely powerful God who could shield them from any spiritual aggressors. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2136))

Idols would be abandoned, their temples neglected, and their livelihoods, as well as the heart of their culture, would wither and die. ([Location 2145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2145))
- The seriousness of this event should not be underestimated. This riot was what the Romans called a seditio or “sedition.” This was a grave enough disturbance in civic order to draw their military attention. Troops would march, order would be restored, and a lesson would be given to the local inhabitants in the form of mass crucifixions. Moreover, Paul was somehow involved in this. He looked like an instigator. If anyone ever succeeded in pinning this event on him before a Roman tribunal, he was a dead man. ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2153))

- Paul now hatches a plan to repair all this relational damage with Corinth in stages. The first thing he does is to change his representative at Corinth. Previously the timid Timothy represented him. Now he sends Titus. We don’t know much about Titus. Second Timothy 4:10 says that he left Paul for “Dalmatia” during Paul’s last imprisonment, so perhaps he was a convert from Paul’s mission up the east coast of the Adriatic. ([Location 2165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2165))
- Perhaps think of Titus then as a tall and somewhat intimidating Croatian arriving in Corinth as Paul’s new representative.

- Titus brings excellent news. At least some of the Corinthians have responded well to 1 Corinthians and its aftermath. They have addressed some of the issues it named, and they received him well.

- They will be exposed to misunderstanding, to cultural hostility, and to physical challenges. Furthermore, their leadership will be vulnerable if those they convert do not reevaluate their own cultural markers of success and realize that God is calling them to abandon those. Converts tend to bring their prejudices straight into the church, leaving them behind only slowly after a long period of teaching and adjustment. If they do not abandon these cultural values—perhaps because the wrong leaders are modeling the wrong things for them—they will horribly misunderstand who should be leading them. In local cultural terms, Christian leaders look like nothing, and if they are authentic Christian leaders that is just what they should look like. They abandon pagan markers of leadership, which are invariably tied to some ascent to fame, status, and fortune. Fake Christian leaders, however, will probably look… ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2202))

- vulnerability. Another important marker of authenticity is the activity of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus, so where Jesus went, reaching out to the unlovely, the Spirit of Jesus goes as well. Consequently, as apostles, which is to say, missionaries, travel into difficult and challenging spaces, the Spirit is there attesting to their authenticity by touching those who are listening to them. “These people don’t look like much and, even worse, they talk about a God who was crucified, but something dramatic and divine happens as they teach us. They say that resurrection is on the other side of all this and I see my Aunty Janelle has been healed from her gout, and my Uncle Sam is speaking some strange heavenly language and falling on the floor, which really isn’t like him.

But once in that place, in the friendships that result, we can and obviously should, if we are able, continue to gift our friends with what they need out of our resources. Love is generous and not merely kind, as Paul has already said in 1 Corinthians (13:4). But love is not compelled. So such generosity is free in the sense of being voluntary and uncoerced, Paul points out (2 Cor. 8:3, 17; 9:7). It keeps no measure of raw totals.

- Paul’s teaching in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 reveals that a Christian community’s attitudes to money and economy are shaped by the generous Lord it worships, and those attitudes may end up being strongly countercultural. ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2272))
- we also need to speak from this point onward of “disputes.” “Conflicts” denote fundamental axes of difference characterized by ongoing hostility, anxiety, and the threat of violence. In a conflict there may be no actual incidents or specific fights taking place at a given moment, just ongoing hatred. “Disputes” are specific disagreements. These might be as minor as arguing with a waiter about the accuracy of a restaurant bill, or as major as shooting someone you have caught sleeping with your spouse. Conflicts and disputes can be related. A dispute within a broader conflict will most likely be escalated, and an ongoing conflict will lead to a higher number of disputes. So it is especially important to try to resolve conflicts because of the way they inflame and multiply actual disputes. But there doesn’t have to be a conflict for a dispute to break out. People can have a fight over anything, and frequently do, while some conflicts roll destructively on, the sides festering with hatred, with few or no disputes. ([Location 2276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2276))
- In fact, dispute resolution and conflict resolution pose the most acute if often unnoticed challenges to Christianity. ([Location 2289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2289))
- The Christian community is premised on the fact God has resolved a dispute with humanity in person. This is not God’s only reason for being involved with us. This resolution restores a relationship and a plan that have been in place from before the foundation of the world. But resolution is clearly a key part of it. The plan has to be brought back on track if it is to move forward. Christians proclaim, at the heart of their message, that God has dealt with the sins of the world through Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. But this is just technical Christian language for the claim that the relationship between God and humanity has been restored and the estrangement between them resolved. The conflict at the heart of the universe has been resolved. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2290))
- Hence when we fail to resolve the smallest disputes within our communities effectively, not to mention their ongoing conflicts, this is an ongoing disconfirmation of the truth of what we are saying. Moreover, clearly this shortfall cripples the ability of Christians to offer anything useful to the rest of the world in the way of peacemaking. It is vital to see, then, that in 2 Corinthians Paul offers us a model of dispute resolution as it was widely practiced in ancient societies. This can be highly effective, but it has been overlaid by modern bureaucratic and institutional methods in our day that are arguably much less constructive. What a revolution it would be if Christians took back dispute resolution from the state and learned how to do it properly. The Christian city must, in short, face the fact that disputes happen, along with conflicts, and that resolving them involves certain techniques, skills, and a lot of hard work, which it is incumbent upon Christians to learn.

- What matters is that this behavior has hurt Paul and has damaged the congregation. So the Corinthians have visited disapproval and shame upon the perpetrators, and shame is the most unpleasant emotion that people can experience. Paul now says that this is sufficient. The one who has grieved others and is now shamed must be restored, and the community’s love must be affirmed. The Corinthians must forgive and encourage so that the people in question are not overwhelmed, and if the congregation fails to do this, it is being outwitted by Satan’s schemes!

- In just the same way, Christian communities should organize themselves and practice reconciling their own members together when they have disputes.

- Christian leaders don’t look like much to the outsider, and they shouldn’t.

- An astonishingly successful mission has suddenly exploded in Utah. Young ministers, graduates from a well-regarded divinity school and thus highly trained in the importance of noncolonial sensibilities, have been sent there by their bishop to do mission work, and people have begun to flood into the Methodist churches in and around Salt Lake City. The mission’s success verges on being a revival. The bishop is initially very pleased. But then disturbing reports begin to reach him. Apparently, these flocks of new converts all happily confess that Jesus is Lord and endorse the triune God of grace. But no one is being baptized or taking the Lord’s Supper. These rites have been abandoned. Moreover, churchgoing with special linen undergarments is viewed as acceptable if not as standard. Sayings from the book of Mormon are being quoted liberally in the church alongside quotations from the Bible. Most disturbing of all, there are rumors that polygamy has been ruled acceptable, and many male converts with multiple wives are coming tearfully out of the closet and living and worshiping openly with their impressively large families. The bishop contemplates simply excommunicating the young missionaries and their new congregations immediately. But he generously sends a letter along with a small delegation of trusted co-workers, ordering all those involved to return to traditional Christian practices without further ado.

- First, as a result of this deal, the early church was fundamentally diverse. The church as a whole was a partnership between messianic Jews, who lived fully committed Jewish lives, and converted pagans, known at this time as Christians, who in certain respects did things very differently. And it still is (or at least it should be). This profound diversity framed by an even more fundamental unity is built into the very foundations of what the church is all about, although it is hard to appreciate it when the importance of fully practicing messianic Jews within the body of Christ, and of Jews in general, is not recognized.

- Second, not everyone accepted the Jerusalem deal. As is common in deep conflicts, a small militant faction did not accept the decision of the majority at the meeting and set out to undermine it. I am reminded here of the “Good Friday Agreement” that brought a lasting peace to the conflict in Northern Ireland shortly after my family and I arrived to live in Great Britain in 1996. The Irish Republican Army—the terrorist wing of Irish resistance to British rule known as the IRA—signed off on the deal. But an IRA faction was unhappy and split off to continue terrorist activities, styling themselves “the Real IRA.” The unhappy figures in Jerusalem were the Real IRA of the early church, and they were very like Paul when he was Saul—learned, sincere, zealous, deeply dedicated to God, and completely wrong. We will call them “the Enemies,” since this is what Paul calls them once in an uncharitable moment.2 ([Location 2422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2422))

- About a year and a half after the Jerusalem conference, the Enemies set out from Jerusalem to reverse the damage they thought Paul had inflicted on the Jesus movement. They traveled through Paul’s communities in 51 CE, exhorting everyone to convert fully to Judaism as the only path to salvation. In other words, they ignored the Jerusalem deal and its terms and set about undermining it. If round one between Paul and the Enemies had been in Antioch, and round two in Jerusalem—at which point Paul was clearly ahead on points—round three would take place in Paul’s own churches, and it would be a fight to the death.

- The Enemies are not legitimate interpreters of the inner truth of Judaism, just as they fail to understand the gospel. All the textual data that describe their teaching—attempted justification through works of law—can be sidelined. This material looks Jewish, and in a certain sense it is, but it is not Paul’s account of Judaism. ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2819))
- Where Paul starts his account is, as always, very important. He begins with his present situation, baptized in Jesus, with a renewed mind gifted to him by the Spirit. ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2823))
- However, for Paul the personal presence of the God of Israel in Jesus was a given. It was bedrock. It was non-negotiable. And God gets to say what Judaism is all about. It follows from this that Paul’s view of Judaism, past, present, and future, will be deeply informed by Jesus. ([Location 2825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2825))
- it is important to emphasize that messianic Jews within the church are Jews. They are not Christians. Paul expects them to live like Jews. ([Location 2834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2834))

- Paul distinguishes between the Spirit’s use of Scripture to mediate the commands and teachings of the risen Jesus and his Father, and other uses of Scripture, which are then pretty much our own idea. These last uses can be taken hostage by the flesh and the evil Powers that live in it. ([Location 2865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2865))
- Instructions governed by the Spirit are recognizable because they give life. They build up the body of Christ and guide it on the pathways of obedience. When Paul uses scriptural texts to teach, they all basically speak about a God revealed in Jesus and working through that person. “Whatever promises God has promised to us they are ‘Yes’ in him” (2 Cor. 1:20). As a result, the “Torah that is Christ” is our primary teacher (1 Cor. 9:21; Gal. 6:2).6 Christ speaks through Scripture, and this is not just acceptable; it is critical. Christians and Jews need written texts to shape their language. But the one who speaks ultimately is God. ([Location 2867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2867))
- The second, human use of Scripture, however, is vulnerable to exploitation by evil Powers. It leads ultimately to death, and the teaching of the Enemies would be a good example of this. This is why the death-dealing aspect of Scripture comes up so clearly in the letters Paul wrote to deal with the Enemies, and why we are addressing it here. If we doubt the importance of this type of scriptural activity we need only to recall quickly the way the Scriptures were extensively used to sustain the cause of the Confederacy during the American Civil War, principally by endorsing the ongoing existence of slavery. This exegetical work was by no means irresponsible. It was careful and nuanced. Consequently, generations of scholars, teachers, and preachers in the southern states taught that the word of God had no problem with slavery, and even more than this; the Bible encouraged it. Yet the church today would universally recognize this use of Scripture in defense of slavery as demonic. Scripture can ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2873))

- The presence of the commands from God—in particular, the instruction not to eat from the tree of good and evil—was what created the opening for the evil Powers to deceive and ultimately to kill humanity. Paul sees this dynamic at work in all subsequent uses of Scripture that are not taken up by God—he uses the tenth commandment’s prohibition of covetousness—and it is a sobering thought. Fleshly interpretation is open to seduction, manipulation, and colonization by the evil Powers that roam our cosmos, and they like nothing better than to oppress, to enslave, and to ([Location 2884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078P97VVJ&location=2884))
- The instructions about what not to do, in all their stunning details, told me exactly what to do. All that information was now imprinted indelibly on my mind.

- Without the animation of the Spirit and the summons of Christ, they are just words that have been written down by human hands with pen and ink and parchment—treasured and valuable to be sure.

- Note carefully now what account of past Judaism Paul has created. The basic story has God placed centrally as the key actor, as is appropriate.

- Although Paul knows the Mosaic stories well, and appeals to them from time to time as he needs to, he has defined Israel in terms of its origins, using the stories of the patriarchs and matriarchs.
