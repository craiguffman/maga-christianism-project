### Highlights

- We have already discussed typology (see pp. 17–20, “Further Reflections: Typology”), a major form of biblical interpretation in the early church. Here we are given an extended example of how this method is employed. It connects events in the past with what is happening in our own day, making us part of the ongoing history of God’s activity in the world. That is, the flood occurred in the past but baptism is an event in our own lives that connects us to the meaning of that ancient happening.

- however we interpret it, the death of Christ was for the purpose of bringing us to God, and that it was once and for all. ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1904))
- In the West, for centuries, most Christians, Protestant and Catholic, have understood the atonement to mean that, because of human sin, a debt was owed to God, and that debt could be paid only by Christ. He died in our place. The death of Christ is seen in the New Testament as a sacrifice for sin, which was indeed a payment of a debt. In the time of the temple, sacrifices were offered to pay for sin. But there is also a view, held strongly by the early church, that the human problem was not a debt owed to God, but that sin had allowed Satan, the powers of evil, to have dominion over us. The powers of sin, death, and evil are all bound together, and we are under that sway. At the cross, all of these powers tried to capture Jesus and, at least on Friday and Saturday, that seemed to have happened. Death and evil had won. In the resurrection on Easter morning it became clear that Christ has triumphed over all of these powers, ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1905))
- those who believe in him are able to begin to live the new life free from the bondage to sin and death. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1911))
- Very often the church thinks of itself as the haven of the righteous, calling them out of the sinful world. This is only partly true, however. The church is always made up of unrighteous people who have been rescued from their unrighteousness by the death of Christ, the righteous one. And even though we are part of the new life, we are still unrighteous in the sense that we still are sinners. If we forget this, and assume that we are not sinners like those outside the church, we place ourselves outside the bounds of the work of Christ. It is in that world that we are to live and make our witness. ([Location 1914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1914))
- it may be difficult for us to think of ourselves as unrighteous. Yet that is the basic step needed in order to understand the work of Christ. Redemption in Christ means forgiveness and repentance. Those who think of themselves as righteous have difficulty thinking they need either. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1919))
- The “once-and-for-all” time character of Christ’s death is essential. At the point of the Protestant Reformation, one of the issues was the medieval stress on the Mass as an unbloody resacrifice of Christ, which to the Reformers implied that his death at Calvary was not sufficient. It was not “once and for all.” Protestants emphasized that in the cross Christ had accomplished all that needed to be done to overcome the separation of sinful humanity from its creator. Jesus is not sacrificed again and again on the altar. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1923))
- the suffering of Christ somehow continues in the suffering of his church, so that our own suffering can be redemptive for others, but only because we are part of the body of Christ. His death was once and for all, but his suffering may continue in his body, though he himself has passed beyond death. ([Location 1933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1933))
- However, if redemption depends upon the work of Christ, what happened to those who died before the incarnation? Essentially, this epistle already signaled an understanding of Christ’s work helping those who had gone before when, in 1:12, even the ancient faithful are seen as waiting until redemption was completed in Christ before they could receive the fruits. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1965))
- Medieval paintings often depict what in Old English was termed “the harrowing of hell.” The risen Christ is pictured leading a host out from hell on Easter morning. There is an echo of this understanding in Ephesians 4:7–10, where Christ led captivity captive. The captivity of death, humanity held in bondage because of sin, was ended with the resurrection, so those who are in Christ rise with him, free from the bondage sin had imposed. (There are interesting reflections of this in Matt. 27:52–53, where the tombs of the faithful dead are opened at the death of Christ, and after his resurrection they appeared to many in Jerusalem.) ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1967))
- Rahner goes on to say that in his death Christ was poured out into the whole cosmos. This implies that in any person’s death, there can be an encounter with Christ in this pan-cosmic sense. It is interesting that John Wesley also believed that the death of Christ changed all humanity, although for Wesley it was a matter that his death provided all humanity with prevenient grace so they could accept the gospel. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=1993))
- The animals and the eight humans were survivors and the seeds of a new creation. Granted, this new creation was not totally new. There were changes, however. Whereas in the first creation human beings and animals lived together without fear, and both animals and humans were vegetarians (Gen. 1:29–30), now both animals and humans will eat meat, which means there will be fear among animals and between animals and humans (Gen. 9:2–5). This new creation is one fit for sinful humanity, and it was marked by violence even at its beginning. What is begun in Christ is a truly new creation, which is peaceful and loving, but the ark remains a symbol of safety in the midst of God’s judgment. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2001))
- The story of the flood describes a judgment of God upon a sinful humanity that has already put violence into the world. Now, after the flood, God has let us live in a world that does include violence—a fallen creation, not only a fallen humanity. The vision of “the peaceable kingdom” at the end of history continues this theme—a redemption of both the creation and its human inhabitants. ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2010))
- Ultimately, the creation will be free of violence. Lions and lambs will be able to live together without violence, as was originally intended. The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of this redemption, although until its fulfillment, we cannot leave the lions with the lambs. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2014))
- The ark prefigured baptism (“prefigured” means it was a type of baptism), since it saves us through water just as the ark saved Noah and his family. Baptism implies dying to the old life and rising to the new life in Christ. For believers, baptism is like the flood that destroyed the sinful creation and at the same time lifts us out of the flood into the ark that begins a new life. Our old life is drowned in the flood. Our new life is in the ark. ([Location 2016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2016))
- Judgment is part of the meaning of baptism. To be baptized is to be judged in the sense that the old life is condemned even as the new begins. None of us totally ends the old life until we die. Even if the new life has begun and grows stronger, the old is not completely overcome. ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2020))
- If the Christian life develops as it should, the old life grows weaker daily and the new creation in us grows stronger. But Christians are still sinners, and our need for God’s forgiveness does not end with baptism. Indeed, one might say that baptism implies a willingness to be judged, to have our lives open to the scrutiny of God through the work of the Holy Spirit, so that we can root out sin. We can be open to judgment because we know through the work of Christ that God loves us and forgives us, wants us to be perfect, and is willing to guide us in that direction. ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2023))
- The ark is the symbol of the church, the ark of salvation, into which we are rescued from the flood. The water of baptism symbolizes this, bringing us from the old life of sin into the new one of grace. Water in this instance is not bathing the body, but washing the soul, the inner person, who now, because of forgiveness, is able to stand in the presence of God with a clear conscience. ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2028))
- The offspring of the mating of angels or “the sons of God” with human women are mentioned in Genesis 6:1–4. This passage, and its explication in 1 Enoch, were commonly cited in the first century. (First Enoch is a Jewish writing used by many early Christian writers.) We will run into them again in 2 Peter and in Jude. These offspring were often blamed for the wickedness that led to the flood. If it is to these spirits that Jesus proclaims a message, it is not clear whether it is a redemptive word or the announcement of his victory over them. In any case, Jesus’ authority over all such powers is part of his victory that ends the oppression of sin and death in the life of humanity. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2052))
- Peter wishes to connect the sins of angelic beings in the ancient past, the victorious proclamation of the risen Christ, and the lives of Christian believers “now.” He uses the flood as a type of God’s catastrophic judgment, which happened only after God’s restrained patience, and he poses the survival of Noah from that divine judgment as a type of Christian salvation, which involves the tamed waters of baptism. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2057))
- In Hebrews 2:5–9 we are reminded that human beings were intended to stand over all creation (the passage uses Gen. 1:27–28 and Ps. 8), and yet, at the present time, we do not see that dominion. In fact, rather than having dominion over all things, human beings are now in bondage to sin and death. But Jesus, who is one of us, has attained that position. He now sits at God’s right hand, and has conquered all that keeps us from the role God intended for human beings in creation. He is the guarantee that we who are part of his body will also finally be what we were created to be. ([Location 2064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EZ3PBW&location=2064))
- Many say that the current exploitation of the earth and its resources can be blamed on the Bible, since it says human beings are to have dominion and therefore humanity is responsible for all the destruction. But as we have seen, for the early church, human beings did not really have such dominion now because they were under the power of evil. It is that evil that has been detrimental to the earth. It is only when humanity is freed from such bondage that it will be able to exercise the dominion it is intended to have.
