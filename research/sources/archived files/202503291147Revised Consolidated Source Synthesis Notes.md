## Hospitality as Holiness (Bretherton)

### Core Theological Framework: Ad Hoc Commensurability

Bretherton's "Hospitality as Holiness" provides a crucial theological framework for addressing the relationship between Christianity and other moral traditions. This directly relates to your project's aim to articulate a faithful Christian political witness that avoids both co-option by the state and isolationist sectarianism.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. The Problem of Incommensurability**

Bretherton, drawing on MacIntyre, articulates how different moral traditions can appear incommensurable—having no common standard of measurement to judge between their respective conceptions of what is rational and moral. This creates a seemingly intractable problem when Christians engage with non-Christians on contested moral issues.

This concept of incommensurability helps diagnose how MAGA Christianism positions itself as embattled against "secular" values while simultaneously adopting non-Christian political practices and frameworks. The apparent contradiction arises from a misunderstanding of the relationship between Christian moral reasoning and other traditions.

**2. Hospitality as a Normative Pattern of Engagement**

Hospitality represents "the normative pattern of faithful relations between Christians and those who are strangers to them." Unlike Grisez's appeal to natural law or an abstract general ethics, and unlike pure sectarianism, hospitality acknowledges both difference and the possibility of ad hoc moral commensurability.

This provides a theological alternative to both the co-option and competition dynamics you identify in MAGA Christianism. Rather than seeing politics as either assimilation or combat, hospitality offers a pattern of engagement that maintains Christian distinctiveness while recognizing genuine common ground.

**3. Justice, Truth, and Patient Endurance**

Bretherton's articulation of tolerance as "patient endurance" that is due to others as a matter of justice offers a powerful counter to MAGA Christianism's binary friend/enemy distinctions. Tolerance as a part of justice means that Christians have an obligation to endure differences even when they find them objectionable:

"Tolerance is a moral perfection, a virtue annexed to justice as one of its parts... the tolerant act justly and the just act tolerantly. They give what justice demands to those from whom they are divided by disagreement and dissent."

This challenges the apocalyptic binary that characterizes MAGA Christianism, which justifies intolerance toward those with different moral and political viewpoints.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 4: The Formation of Virtue

Bretherton's discussion of virtue formation through imitation and habituation directly supports your account of how Christians become virtuous through practices rather than merely through affirming principles.

#### For Chapter 7: The Priority of the Particular

Bretherton's emphasis on "special equity" and the necessity of attending to particular circumstances when applying general principles provides theological grounding for your critique of MAGA Christianism's tendency to apply decontextualized "biblical principles" to complex issues.

#### For Chapter 15: Fear of the Other vs. Love of Neighbor

Bretherton's account of hospitality as hallowing the stranger provides a theological framework for overcoming the politics of fear that characterizes MAGA Christianism. His distinction between tolerance and indifference offers resources for addressing difference without either capitulation or hostility.

## Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)

### Core Theological Framework: Jeremiah 29 as Political Witness

Bretherton's "Christianity and Contemporary Politics" provides a comprehensive theological vision for how churches engage politically in a pluralistic society. His use of Jeremiah 29 as a leitmotif for faithful political witness directly aligns with your project's aim to articulate a post-MAGA Christian politics.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. The Dynamics of Co-option, Competition, and Commodification**

Bretherton identifies three problematic responses to the contemporary political context:
- Co-option: letting the church be construed as a constituency within civil society serving state purposes
- Competition: reframing Christian political witness as identity politics competing for recognition
- Commodification: letting Christianity be construed as a lifestyle choice within the religious marketplace

These three dynamics precisely diagnose the pathologies of MAGA Christianism, which oscillates between being co-opted by nationalist politics, competing as an identity group, and commodifying faith as a cultural marker rather than a discipleship path.

**2. Christian Cosmopolitanism**

Bretherton develops a vision of "Christian cosmopolitanism" that avoids both protectionist nationalism and abstract universalism that denies the importance of particular places and identities:

"A properly theological cosmopolitanism must incorporate the fulfillment of humanity via differentiation into particular sodalities of persons that involve differences of language, kinship, and territoriality... For without discrete identities that take up and play with creation in particular ways through history there can be no interplay of persons in communion."

This offers a powerful theological alternative to MAGA Christianism's nationalist tendencies while avoiding the pitfalls of liberal cosmopolitanism that erases particularity.

**3. Community Organizing as Faithful Witness**

Bretherton analyzes community organizing as a form of faithful political witness that enables Christians to:
1. Form common objects of love with their neighbors
2. Negotiate the terms of faithful citizenship
3. Embody a generative alternative to totalizing power

This practical engagement model helps illustrate what faithful political witness might look like beyond the captivity to nationalist politics that characterizes MAGA Christianism.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 1: Introducing the Crisis of MAGA Christianism

Bretherton's analysis of the dynamics of co-option, competition, and commodification provides a framework for diagnosing the crisis of MAGA Christianism as a distortion of faithful Christian witness.

#### For Chapter 3: Knowledge of God: How Do We Know What We Know?

Bretherton's concept of "special equity" – attending to the particularities of context when applying general principles – directly supports your critique of MAGA Christianism's primitive biblicism.

#### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Bretherton's vision of Christian cosmopolitanism offers a constructive alternative to both MAGA Christianism and secular liberalism, showing how Christians can engage politically without compromising their distinctiveness.

## Tolerance Among the Virtues (Bowlin)

### Core Theological Framework: Tolerance as Virtue

Bowlin's "Tolerance Among the Virtues" provides a robust theological account of tolerance as a moral virtue annexed to justice. This directly challenges the friend/enemy binary that characterizes MAGA Christianism's approach to difference.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. Tolerance as Justice, Not Weakness**

Bowlin challenges the common assumption that tolerance represents weakness or moral relativism. Instead, he argues that tolerance is a virtue that perfects our capacity to respond justly to objectionable differences:

"Intolerance is a vice. Its act wrongs another person. It denies them a good they are due."

This reframing challenges MAGA Christianism's tendency to view compromise or tolerance as weakness rather than as a requirement of justice.

**2. Distinguishing Tolerance from Its Semblances**

Bowlin carefully distinguishes genuine tolerance from its semblances (indifference, acceptance, etc.) and from the vices that oppose it. This nuanced account helps diagnose how MAGA Christianism often mistakes intolerance for virtue and how liberal society often mistakes indifference for tolerance.

**3. Tolerance, Forbearance, and the Theological Virtues**

Bowlin's distinction between tolerance (annexed to justice) and forbearance (annexed to love) helps articulate the relationship between Christian distinctiveness and political pluralism:

"As habit and act, forbearance is as different from tolerance as love is from justice... The forbearing love God when they love the neighbor who belongs to God, when they endure her objectionable difference for the sake of union with her in God..."

This distinction helps navigate the tension between the church's commitment to truth and its obligation to justice in a pluralistic society.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 10: Christ as Supreme Exemplar

Bowlin's account of how forbearance follows Christ's example of enduring human sin provides a theological framework for following Jesus rather than merely believing in him—directly addressing MAGA Christianism's reduction of faith to cultural identity.

#### For Chapter 14: Friend/Enemy Distinctions

Bowlin's account of tolerance as a virtue that perfects our response to objectionable differences directly challenges the friend/enemy distinctions that characterize MAGA Christianism's binary apocalypticism.

#### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Bowlin's careful distinction between tolerance and forbearance provides conceptual resources for articulating a Christian humanism that neither accommodates to liberal indifference nor retreats into binary opposition.

## Reimagining Sovereignty (Bretherton)

### Core Theological Framework: Consociationalism

Bretherton's essay "Reimagining Sovereignty" offers a theological account of political order that challenges both liberal individualism and authoritarian nationalism. This directly addresses MAGA Christianism's entanglement with nationalist politics and authoritarian tendencies.

### Three Key Insights for the Project

**1. Beyond the Ethics/Politics Binary**

Bretherton critiques the tendency to oppose ethics to politics, particularly in the work of Judith Butler and others who attempt to deconstruct sovereignty through ethical appeals. This binary thinking parallels MAGA Christianism's own binary tendency to oppose "biblical values" to "secular politics."

**2. Consociational Political Order**

Bretherton recovers a neglected tradition of political thought—consociationalism or confederalism—that envisions sovereignty as distributed and pluralistic rather than monolithic:

"For Althusius, sovereignty is an assemblage that emerges through and is grounded upon a process of mutual communication between consociations and their reciprocal pursuit of common goods."

This consociational vision directly challenges MAGA Christianism's embrace of authoritarian, centralized power while also avoiding liberal individualism's erosion of community.

**3. The Rojava Revolution as Alternative**

Bretherton points to the Kurdish democratic confederalism of Northern Syria (Rojava) as a concrete example of a political order that eschews ethno-religious nationalism while fostering genuine pluralism:

"The 'Rojava Revolution' has established a fully consociational or confederal polity. It is organized and structured from the bottom up into communes, neighborhoods of communes, and cantons... This democratic confederal structure explicitly eschews any commitment to an ethnically or religiously homogenous nation-state..."

This example helps illustrate what an alternative to both MAGA nationalism and abstract liberalism might look like in practice.

### Integration with the Book Project

#### For Chapter 8: Appeals to Timeless Absolutes

Bretherton's critique of the tendency to appeal to timeless authorities directly addresses MAGA Christianism's appeals to an idealized Christian America or biblical golden age.

#### For Chapter 9: Reinhold Niebuhr and American Pragmatism

Bretherton's critique of ethical thinking that avoids concrete political proposals resonates with your critique of Niebuhr's "practical atheism" that reduces Jesus to "the name of the one who saves us from sin" while adopting philosophical pragmatism as the basis for ethics.

#### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Bretherton's account of consociationalism offers a concrete political vision that could inform your articulation of Christian humanism as a third way beyond both MAGA Christianism and secular alternatives.

## MAGA Christianism Outline

Your outline provides the conceptual framework for critiquing MAGA Christianism through three theological "mutations":

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: The claim to direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning that bypasses interpretive traditions and contexts
2. **Practical Atheism**: The reduction of Jesus to "the name of the one who saves us from sin" while adopting pragmatic politics divorced from Christ's example
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: The division of the world into friends and enemies, saved and damned, with no possibility of reconciliation

This framework offers a theological diagnosis of MAGA Christianism that goes beyond political critique to identify the theological distortions that enable its political manifestations.

### Key Integration Points

- Your emphasis on "water fountain liturgy" as a formative practice aligns with Bretherton's analysis of how practices shape habits and dispositions.
- Your focus on "the cruciform pattern of Christ's kingdom" as an alternative to MAGA Christianism's "idol of national power" resonates with Bowlin's distinction between the forbearance that follows Christ's pattern and the impatience that characterizes political intolerance.
- Your vision of Christian humanism as "a third way beyond both MAGA Christianism and its secular alternatives" aligns with Bretherton's consociational vision of political order.

## Synthesized Voice Profile

Your synthesized voice profile indicates several distinctive emphases that should shape your approach to this project:

1. **Theological Progression**: From Methodist youth formation to Episcopal priesthood, shaped by both traditions
2. **Personal Connection to Systems of White Supremacy**: Growing up in segregated Baton Rouge during the civil rights era with deep Louisiana roots and family background connected to plantation ownership and slavery
3. **Integration of Diverse Experiences**: Former naval officer (nuclear submarine) and business executive now serving as an Episcopal priest and theologian

These personal experiences give you a unique perspective on the theological and political issues at stake in MAGA Christianism. Your personal journey from a libertarian understanding of freedom to a theological understanding of freedom as non-domination parallels the theological journey you're inviting readers to undertake.

### Key Integration Points

- Your experience with "water fountain liturgy" in segregated Louisiana provides a powerful personal connection to how "profane sacraments can form us without our awareness"
- Your navigation of military, business, and theological worlds gives you credibility to speak to diverse audiences about the relationship between Christian faith and political life
- Your Reformed Catholic synthesis approach aligns with Bretherton's consociational vision and Bowlin's careful distinctions between the demands of justice and love
