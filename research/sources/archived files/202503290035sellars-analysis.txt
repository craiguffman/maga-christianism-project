# Sellars' Metaphysics of the Person: Analysis for MAGA Christianism Project

## Key Concepts Relevant to Project

### Aristotelian Framework vs. Cartesian Dualism
- Sellars presents an Aristotelian conception of personhood that contrasts with Cartesian dualism
- For the Aristotelian: "Reference to minds [is] reference to persons *qua* having those states and capacities which are distinctive of rational animals"
- The person is a "complex individual" but not a system of subordinate individuals
- This provides a framework for understanding how MAGA Christianism incorrectly separates spiritual identity from embodied practice

### Person as Unified Subject vs. Bundle
- Sellars critiques both the "bare particular" view and the "bundle theory" of selfhood
- He argues for a conception of persons as unified subjects rather than collections of experiences
- This connects to how MAGA Christianism often reduces Christian identity to a bundle of beliefs divorced from holistic personhood

### Adverbial Theory of Experience
- Sellars develops an adverbial theory where "Tom feels pain" is better understood as "Tom feels painfully"
- This restructures the relationship between persons and their experiences
- Relevant to how MAGA Christianism often mistakes propositional belief for participatory faith

### Causation and Personhood
- Sellars distinguishes "personal causation" from natural causation
- Persons don't cause their actions through volition; rather, persons *act*
- This relates to the Project's critique of practical atheism where Christian identity fails to translate into Christian action

### Function vs. Content
- Sellars distinguishes between the functional and contentual aspects of mental activity
- Concepts pertaining to mental acts are "purely functional" and "transcategorical"
- This helps explain how MAGA Christianism divorces religious language from its proper function in forming Christian character

## Connections to Theological Framework

### Against Primitive Biblicism
- Sellars' emphasis on the complexities of interpretation (his analysis of verbal forms, predication, etc.) provides philosophical grounding for critiquing primitive biblicism
- His distinction between knowing and being corresponds to the difference between claiming direct access to biblical meaning vs. acknowledging interpretive traditions

### Illuminating Practical Atheism
- Sellars' analysis of the relationship between persons and their actions helps explain how MAGA Christianism separates Christian identity from Christian practice
- His critique of "person causes event" conception parallels how MAGA Christianity incorrectly relates faith to action

### Challenging Binary Apocalypticism
- Sellars' nuanced discussion of categories and the errors of binary thinking provides philosophical tools for critiquing apocalyptic binaries
- His emphasis on the complexity of personhood challenges reductive friend/enemy distinctions

## Integration with Theological Sources

### Connection to Campbell
- Campbell's emphasis on participatory ontology aligns with Sellars' critique of Cartesian dualism
- Both challenge transactional understanding of personhood/salvation

### Connection to Pettit
- Sellars' critique of causal accounts of personhood complements Pettit's conception of freedom as non-domination
- Both emphasize relational aspects of personhood

### Connection to Hauerwas
- Sellars' emphasis on practices aligns with Hauerwas' understanding of character formation
- Both reject reduction of personhood to abstract principles or beliefs

## Applications to MAGA Christianism Critique

1. **Identity Formation**: Sellars helps explain how MAGA Christianism separates religious identity from embodied personhood

2. **Truth and Knowledge**: His analysis of the "space of reasons" provides framework for critiquing MAGA Christianism's epistemological claims

3. **Causation and Agency**: Sellars' critique of simplistic causation helps identify how MAGA Christianism misconstrues religious agency

4. **Language Analysis**: His detailed analysis of linguistic structures helps expose conceptual confusions in MAGA Christian discourse

5. **Transcategorical Concepts**: Sellars' treatment of mind concepts as transcategorical helps explain how religious concepts function across different conceptions of personhood
