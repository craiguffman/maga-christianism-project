### Highlights

- In some ways Hooker is the convergence point of many competing and not necessarily reconcilable ideas: in him one can find the stoic-natural law tradition; the Augustinian emphasis on the need for government as a remedy for human sin; the harmony of natural and supernatural ends (which is similar to that of Thomas Aquinas); the Roman lawyer’s belief in untrammelled sovereignty; but also the feudal lawyer’s belief in contract and consent. What unites it all is that there is simply no room for disorder or for alternative ways of understanding the world. Uniformity under the monarch is everything: this is perhaps the furthest extension of Troeltsch’s idea of the church. How much longer such an idea could survive, however, was an open question. After all, many had quite different pictures of what the Church of England should look like. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=784))
- The puritans achieved very little and, instead of looking to the King, many turned instead to the Parliament. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=800))
- Parliament also declined to increase the coercive power of the ecclesiastical courts against the power of the civil courts: a stronger Church would mean a weaker Parliament. The battle lines were being drawn. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=807))
- The conflict centred on the teachings of the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609). Against the Calvinists, Arminians believed that even the elect could fall from grace, and that the non-elect were damned because of their own sins rather than from all eternity. This allowed for a certain degree of free will: God’s grace could be resisted. Christ died for all, even though none but the faithful could enjoy the pardon of sin. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=812))
- In distinction, the Arminian notion, which accepted a universality of salvation and the possibility of co-operation with God’s grace, placed great stress on the obedience to the divinely appointed authority. The controversialist lawyer John Selden noted the irony of this position: The puritans who will allow no free-will at all, but God does all, yet will allow the subject his liberty to do or not to do, notwithstanding the king, the god upon earth. The Arminians, who hold we have free-will, yet say, when we come to the king there must be all obedience, and no liberty must be stood for. The church of all true believers, which for the Calvinists was located in an invisible realm known alone to God, became in Arminianism the visible church in which all endeavoured to live freely in accordance with the divine will. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=823))
- It was not long before there were moves away from rigid Calvinism. This expressed itself in what has been called ‘avant-garde conformism’. Many sought to re-order church buildings. Richard Neile, Bishop of Durham (1617–28), for instance, moved the communion table into an ‘altarwise’ position up against the east end of the church rather than ‘tablewise’ in the chancel (Figure 7), and in 1620 rebuilt a stone altar. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=829))
- This emphasized the importance of the sacraments as a means of grace. In the 1620s, anti-Calvinists were promoted, including William Laud (1573–1645), ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=833))
- The later years of James’s reign and the early years of Charles’s saw a flowering of theology and spirituality, particularly among a small group of well-educated churchmen, often known as the Caroline Divines. For men like Jeremy Taylor and Lancelot Andrewes, the emphasis was on regular prayer, a high view of the sacraments and episcopate, knowledge of the Fathers, and the ‘practice of the presence of God’. Some later thinkers, particularly from Anglo-Catholic backgrounds, have seen them as embodying the heart of Anglican spirituality, although they typify a very one-sided way of understanding the reformed theology of the Prayer Book. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=838))
- In London, Laud made a number of changes: ministers were to be called priests, ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=846))
- Several bishops encouraged the building of altars, most importantly Matthew Wren at Norwich and William Peirce at Bath and Wells. Recent scholars have suggested that these policies of clerical aggrandizement and imposition of conformity were important causes of the Civil War. There was a very rapid destabilization of the fragile ecclesiastical peace of the earlier years of the 17th century. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=848))
- Henry VIII established six new cathedrals with his monastic spoils (although Westminster Abbey survived as a cathedral for a mere ten years). ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=854))
- Cathedral clergy served outside the parish system, ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=855))
- A high standard of choral music persisted in cathedrals and the other non-parochial churches, such as the Chapels Royal or Westminster Abbey, perhaps because of Elizabeth I’s love of music. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=856))
- As is satirized in Anthony Trollope’s Barchester novels, large endowments continued through to the 19th century, when finally the number of canons was restricted to no more than six and large sums were redistributed to the wider church to endow poorer parishes. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=858))
- To some, the imposition of conformity was little short of Catholicism in disguise. In the 1630s ecclesiastical policy led to the persecution of puritans and the silencing of other voices, including the Calvinism of Bishop Davenant of Salisbury. In 1633, the Book of Sports was re-issued which permitted lawful recreation on Sundays, challenging the sabbatarianism of the puritans. The situation worsened with the imposition of the Scottish Book of Common Prayer which bypassed the General Assembly. The new Canons of 1640 made matters even worse, reasserting the Divine Right of the King and attempting to ensure uniformity. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=869))
- After the outbreak of war, there were efforts to reform the Church of England. This led to the Westminster Assembly, a Synod of 30 lay assessors and over 120 divines of different opinions, which met over 1,000 times until 1653. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=875))
- The attempt to reform the Thirty-Nine Articles along solidly Reformed lines produced the Westminster Confession in 1646. This emphasized the invisible church against the visible church ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=877))
- The Book of Common Prayer was banned in 1645 and in its place the Assembly produced a Directory for the Public Worship of God, which contained more general instructions than forms of service. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=880))
- Many later attempts at conciliation collapsed: there were far more extreme measures against the King and the Church, most importantly the execution of William Laud and eventually of the King. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=883))
- To ensure that there was some degree of consistency, a National Committee of Triers and local Committees of Ejectors were established. Some 2,000 to 3,000 ‘malignant’ and ‘scandalous’ clergy were expelled and new clergy put in their place. Evidence of God’s grace became the chief criterion for ministry: ‘they must not admit a man unless they be able to discern some of the grace of God in him’. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=888))
- hand, a not insignificant number, including about three to four hundred clergy, refused to acknowledge the rights of the new King and Queen and formed the group of ‘non-jurors’. Others sought a new settlement that would give the church and monarch a certain degree of independence from the government: this group (the High Churchmen) was almost synonymous with the Tories, who fought against the encroachments of the Whig government. Some others (the Low Churchmen) proved far more inclined to accept a stronger Parliament ruling directly over the church, especially after the proroguing of Convocation in 1717. ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=973))
- Evangelicalism, the first of the great religious revivals, was marked by a form of religious authority based on the security of a personal religious experience as a marker of authenticity. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=982))
- Evangelicals soon set about reforming the church and the world. Where earlier Church of England controversies had focused primarily on church order and authority, Evangelicals stressed lifestyle, doctrine, and conduct. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=986))
- For some Evangelicals there was a sense of optimism: the Christian duty was to co-operate with God’s grace through the salvation wrought in Christ, which meant that Christians could live the life of holiness. And holiness would lead, as John Wesley put it, to happiness. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=992))
- This distinction between nominal and real Christianity was a central feature of Evangelical religion, and ushered in a recognition that all was not well with the world. A sense of moral earnestness led to campaigns in Parliament and elsewhere. Vast sums were given to charities, including missions and schools. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1000))
- Among the early Evangelicals there was a highly moralistic programme that was organized into a Society for the Suppression of Vice which campaigned against indecency and profanation of the Lord’s Day. Alongside this was an emphasis on prayers in the family, and domestic religion. ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1009))
- From the beginning, Evangelicals agreed on the importance of conversion: there was a point at which the individual came to accept his or her own salvation. John Wesley’s conversion is probably the best known: I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation: And an assurance was given me, that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1021))
- By the end of the 19th century, Evangelicalism had been transformed into a movement which was defined in terms of its opposition to ritualism, but also as something which focused on rallies of the like-minded. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1109))
- Through its history Evangelicalism developed strong principles of boundary maintenance through group identity and partisan campaigns. In this it shares a great deal with the other great church party, ‘Anglo-Catholicism’, which developed out of the Oxford Movement of the 1830s and which defined itself over and against the groups of the wider church, sometimes ‘evangelicals’, sometimes ‘liberals’ (in their view, the real menace). ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1191))
- The term ‘sect’ provides a useful characterization of Anglo-Catholicism with its emphasis on holiness and authority: Anglo-Catholicism, like Evangelicalism, has been frequently reduced to a set of almost tribal identities or badges. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1195))
- The religious revival that began in the 1830s among a group of young Oxford dons was caused by a complex set of ecclesiastical and political circumstances. Perhaps most important was the decreasing influence of the Church of England in the… ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1197))
- Where kings (and parliaments) had once seen it as their duty to protect the church, it had become imperative for… ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1199))
- At its heart, the Oxford Movement was a response to a crisis in authority. If Evangelicalism had thrust the locus of authority from the monarch and the divinely appointed institutions of state to the experience of the individual heart and the truth of scripture, so the Oxford Movement… ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1200))
- In the years immediately preceding 1833, there were a number of specific ‘attacks’ on the Church of England. In 1828, the Test and Corporation Acts had been repealed, which meant that nonconformist men could hold public office and sit in Parliament. The following year saw the emancipation of Catholics, which led to significant opposition in Oxford to the University MP, Robert Peel, who had supported the Bill. Worse was to come in 1832 when a large number of middle-class men were enfranchised and many of the grossest abuses in the electoral system were reformed: new centres of power, possibly hostile to the church, were being created.… ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1203))
- To add insult to injury, the government sought to amalgamate a number of Irish bishoprics primarily on pragmatic grounds, since in parts of Ireland there were virtually no Anglicans. But there were higher principles at stake: what right had an assembly that now comprised dissenters and Roman Catholics to legislate in matters affecting the United Church of England and Ireland? How could successors of the apostles themselves be abolished by a human state? This led to John Keble’s charge of National Apostasy in his sermon before the judges of the Oxford assizes in the University Church of 14 July 1833, which John Henry Newman marked as the beginning of the Oxford Movement: ‘As a Christian nation she is also part of the Christian Church, and in all her legislation and policy bound by the fundamental rules of the church.’ The 1833 measure was an outrageous affront to the rights of the… ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1210))
- The doctrine of ministry and sacraments became central to the teachings of… ([Location 1218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1218))
- Newman (Figure 10) published the first of the Tracts for the Times (hence the… ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1219))
- the ministerial commission does not come from government, Newman asked, then where does it come from? The answer was from God himself. No gates of hell, not even a Whig government,… ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1222))
- This high doctrine of the ministry led to a new sense of seriousness and a high… ([Location 1227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1227))
- The Tractarians thereby gained the confidence to face up to the threats on the church from both the state and competing forces within the church. They organized opposition to liberals, especially R. D. Hampden on his nomination as Regius Professor in 1836. Liberalism was a slippery slope which would lead to the dismemberment of the church. The church needed to assert its supernatural and divinely founded identity against all comers. Initially there was a great deal of common ground with other churchmen and few direct assaults on the Reformation. By the late 1830s, however, things began to change. Keble wrote in 1836: ‘Anything which separates the present… ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1229))
- Newman similarly sought to return power to the church. He turned round Henry VIII’s argument: the church’s powers had been usurped by a state, and a utilitarian and liberal state to boot. ([Location 1248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1248))
- There were obvious continuities with the past: there was a revival of interest in the 17th-century divines and their High Church successors who had emphasized the doctrine of apostolic succession. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1253))
- However, where earlier Anglican theories of apostolic succession placed equal emphasis on the supernatural authority of the King, this was no longer possible for the Tractarians. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1255))
- Like many of their High Church predecessors, the Tractarians sought to defend their understanding of the church in the writings of the early Fathers, sponsoring a massive project of translation, The Library of the Fathers. It was the undivided church of the first centuries that provided their model of authentic Christianity. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1258))
- The main focus of the Tractarians had been the advocacy of a distinctive theology of ministry which magnified the priestly office. From the late 1830s, this was to have a profound effect on the architecture and liturgy of the Church of England. Of vital importance was the Cambridge Camden Society, which spawned the so-called Ecclesiological Movement. Influenced by Pugin’s polemics against the degenerate architecture of classicism, they sought to return the church to the true principles of Christian architecture. They set about describing the ‘mutilated architectural remains’ of English churches, as well as coming up with bold and somewhat dictatorial designs for rebuilding. In a time of rapid demographic change and expansion, both at home and overseas, such ideas could attract a quite disproportionate influence. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1265))
- Many dioceses set up societies to promote architecture and ritual. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1272))
- The physical appearance of churches was transformed: the focus moved from nave to chancel transforming the theology of both sacrament and word. The clergy were separated and elevated above their congregation. The favouring of the high medieval art of the 14th century led to a complete transformation of church interiors. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1273))
- Most importantly, there was a wholesale removal of furniture which had been constructed for the Book of Common Prayer. There were polemics against rented pews and their replacement with free benches. All people were equal in the sight of God – and all were to be given a view of the altar. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1276))
- The Camden Society decreed instead that the altar should be raised on a few steps above the height of the chancel; the font should be at the west end; hassocks were recommended in preference to boards; galleries were banned. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1280))
- organs began to replace parish bands. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1282))
- Everything in the church was to symbolize something: the tiles on the roof, for instance, were ‘the soldiers, who preserve the church... from enemies’. This provoked a holy war against whitewash. When the clergyman set about restoring his church (and it seems nearly always to have proceeded in this direction) he was told to begin with the east end, traditionally the incumbent’s responsibility. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1282))
- Some new churches provoked considerable reaction, primarily because of the ritualism which accompanied the new designs. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1287))
- For instance, St Saviours, Leeds, founded by Pusey, was staffed by an unmarried ‘college’ of priests who started wearing Roman liturgical vestments as well as birettas. In 1850, St Barnabas, Pimlico, introduced an eagle lectern as well as banners, screens, and a cross and candles on the altar. This provoked one of the first great ritualist court cases: in the ruling altar lights were banned. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1288))
- By 1857, the following had already been declared legal: the credence table, the cross on the chancel screen, the unrestricted use of the cross as a symbol, frontals of various colours, and the altar cross as long as it was not fixed. What they lost were the stone altar covered with a lace cloth, and the permission to omit the inscription of the Ten Commandments from the chancel. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1305))
- Many Evangelical MPs and churchmen became almost fixated on opposition to what they regarded as Anglican imitations of Rome. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1308))
- This defensive attitude led to the formation of the Church Association in 1865, which spent £40,000 prosecuting ritualists between 1868 and 1880. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1313))
- Mackonochie was taken to court in 1867 for the use of incense and altar lights, and also for what was quaintly termed ‘excessive kneeling’. The court cases led to rulings which reveal an extraordinary level of anxiety among Evangelicals. In 1870, the mixed chalice, wafers, the old eucharistic vestments of chasubles and tunicles were declared legal, but this was later overturned on appeal in 1871. Flower vases were legalized in 1870, although altar lights had to wait until 1890 to be lit. A Royal Commission led to Disraeli’s 1874 Public Worship Regulation Act which, trying to outlaw ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1314))
- In 1875, the ECU, under the influence of C. L. Wood (later Lord Halifax), adopted a manifesto of six points for which it was prepared to fight (the use of vestments, altar lights, the mixed chalice, wafer bread, incense, and facing east during the prayer of consecration, rather than standing at the north end as suggested in the Prayer Book). ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1319))
- Like Evangelicalism, Anglo-Catholicism was marked by a strong sense of identity. Certain symbols or practices (such as sacramental confession or ritualized ablutions) became the outward signs of belonging. Often bizarre societies devoted to practices like adoration of the blessed sacrament or prayers for the dead became markers of group identity. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1325))
- Men like Pusey and the Ecclesiologist J. M. Neale were responsible for encouraging the revival of the religious life, particularly among women. This proved extraordinarily successful: by 1900 there were around 10,000 members of religious orders in England, nearly all strongly influenced by ritualism. For the first time since the Reformation, Anglican women could become religious ‘professionals’, even if the question of ordination was not addressed. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1336))
- There were, of course, many churchmen through the 19th century who were neither Evangelicals nor Anglo-Catholics. They were often labelled ‘Broad Churchmen’ and associated with the new ‘public’ schools. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1340))
- Many, including the leading theologian F. D. Maurice, disliked the ‘new nickname’ because it suggested that they were merely another party. He attacked the notion of party in the name of a broad national church, whose boundaries should be co-terminous with those of the state. ‘The Church exists’, he wrote, ‘to tell the world of its true Centre, of the law of mutual sacrifice by which its parts are bound together. The Church exists to maintain the order of the nation and the order of the family.’ ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1342))
- Much survived of their national church ideal into the 20th century. It proved vitally important in times of national crisis and in the building up of the welfare state. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1348))
- In the later years of the 19th century, Anglo-Catholicism grew rapidly. Ritualism began to cross over from the partisan extremes into the mainstream of Church of England life. At the same time, a number of influential Anglo-Catholics were appointed to the episcopate. However, like Evangelicalism, Anglo-Catholicism began to fragment into different groups by the turn of the 20th century. Different styles of dress, coupled with the intricacies of liturgy and ritual, became identifiers of particular varieties of ritualism or catholicism: what was called the ‘Sarum Empire’ (after the reverence for the 1549 Prayer Book with its remnant of medieval ritual) was pitched against the forces of the quasi-Romanists. Although the extraordinary achievement of the ritualists had left virtually no church building untouched by the Gothic revival, which meant that worship, even in country parishes, was almost unrecognizably different from 70 years before, most Church of England people and clergy would have been reluctant to identify themselves as Anglo-Catholic. Perhaps the greatest liturgical achievement was the rise of the Parish Communion movement, especially after the Second World War, which established the eucharist as the main Sunday service in probably the majority of English churches. The name ‘Anglo-Catholic’, however, was reserved for those who followed a distinctive set of practices, art, and dress. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1358))
- Roughly speaking, there were two main trajectories of Anglo-Catholicism through the 20th century. One of these – which might be referred to as ‘English Catholicism’ – moved into the Anglican mainstream. The other strand, which will be discussed first, was associated with the fashionable extremism of an alternative and often very precisely defined culture. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1368))
- introduced ‘High Mass’ in which the congregation did not receive communion, held regular ‘private’ masses for particular intentions, and adopted Latin practices such as the stations of the cross and use of the rosary. Much of this was done in flagrant disobedience to episcopal authority. Pilgrimage re-established itself, particularly after the restoration of the Shrine of ‘Our Lady’ at ‘England’s Nazareth’ at Walsingham in Norfolk, which became the centre of an extraordinary combination of English romantic medievalism and post-Tridentine Latin Christianity. Organizations established themselves devoted to reconciliation with Rome, one of them (the Catholic League) explicitly accepting and praying for the Bishop of Rome. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1382))
- This strange amalgam of sexuality, Romanism, and a sectarian mentality was not, however, the only strand of Anglo-Catholic church life through the 20th century. Another strand was developed by Percy Dearmer, incumbent of St Mary’s Church, Primrose Hill, in north London. A student of art and liturgy, Dearmer published the Parson’s Handbook in 1899, an extraordinarily influential manual of English liturgical practice. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1392))
- After the First World War, Anglo-Catholicism appeared triumphant. Many of the ritualist battles had been won (or at least bishops had been ignored). ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1408))
- Although there are no accurate figures, a common estimate for 1930 is that about one-third of all Church of England priests and lay communicants identified themselves as Anglo-Catholics: where Evangelicalism was divided, Anglo-Catholicism appeared to be victorious. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1412))
- most recently, many Anglo-Catholics have set themselves against the ordination of women. Like some factions within Evangelicalism, many Anglo-Catholics have defined themselves negatively against the wider church with its so-called ‘liberal’ agenda. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1433))
- That said, the more inclusive strand of Anglo-Catholicism that followed in the direction pioneered by Gore and Dearmer (who drew on the legacy of the broad churchman F. D. Maurice) found its way into mainstream Anglicanism through the liturgical renewal of the 1960s and 1970s. ([Location 1440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1440))
- Earlier chapters have shown the Church of England to be based on a theory of royal supremacy. Ordination oaths were (and still are) sworn to a monarch who was also supreme governor of the church, but over which Parliament had become increasingly sovereign. This meant that the church was subject to predominantly lay control, even though the bishops had a constitutional right to sit in the House of Lords. The Church of England was so tied up with the state that it was far from clear what it could possibly mean outside England. The word ‘Anglican’ is little more than a Latinized form of ‘English’ (and was used in conscious imitation of ‘Gallican’ as the French equivalent). Henry VIII’s theory of ecclesiastical autonomy means that decisions were often made with scant regard to other churches: all sovereignty over both church and state was to be exercised within national boundaries. As the Church of England expanded overseas, it became clear that something different would have to emerge: could there be an Anglicanism where the King of England was not sovereign? What would be the role of local legislatures in regulating a church whose final authority depended on the British Parliament?

- As William Reed Huntington (1838–1909), Rector of Grace Church, New York, asked: was it little more than the ‘flutter of surplices, a vision of village spires and cathedral towers, a somewhat stiff and stately company of deans, prebendaries and choristers’? Or was there something else that constituted the essence of Anglicanism? ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1457))
- After the union of the English and Scottish crowns, for much of the 17th century there was a strange blend of bishops and Presbyterianism in Scotland. Yet after William III’s seizure of power in 1688, the Scottish bishops refused to swear the oath of allegiance: throughout the 18th century there were questions of loyalty, and bishops were not officially tolerated until 1712. With many continuing to support Stuart claims, Scottish Episcopalian clergy were banned from officiating after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1464))
- The Scottish Episcopal Church survived as an independent body, which for practical purposes was not ‘in communion’ with the Church of England. Indeed, the sense in which such a church can be called ‘Anglican’ is open to question. It was supported neither by Crown nor Parliament and had to find its authority elsewhere. It is no surprise that the Scottish Episcopal Church was closely associated with the Oxford Movement, with its high view of the independent authority of the church, almost from the beginning. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1469))
- The most influential commissary of all was Thomas Bray, who was appointed to Maryland by Compton. He recognized the need for more organized work in the colonies, setting up the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698 to encourage literature and education, and three years later the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). Supported by leading English churchmen, they set about trying to appoint bishops for the colonies, as well as organizing missions to the unevangelized (the ‘heathen’ as they were known at the time). There was a desperate need for local organization: the 300 or so missionaries sent out to America before independence were far too distant to maintain any real sense of contact with the Bishop of London, and there was little hope of missionary activity without a ready supply of ministers: the journey to London for ordination was hardly an incentive for an increase in vocations. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1480))
- in most colonies parish priests were appointed by parishioners, and churches became increasingly self-supporting. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1487))
- It took until 1840 before formal communion with the Church of England was established. The American democratic tradition coupled with a long legacy of self-supporting congregations has had repercussions on global Anglicanism up until the present day. ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1524))
- Pitt’s government appointed a bishop for Nova Scotia who would also cover the territories of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The aim in part was to ensure loyalty to the Crown. ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1530))
- With grants from the SPG, in the hands of an influential group of High Churchmen, the Hackney Phalanx, the church expanded rapidly, but from the outset there were difficulties with the civil authorities. Inglis was not the easiest character: he was not much given to travel, which did not go down well in such a vast diocese. Parliament in Britain, however, continued to support the church in Canada. By 1816, the relationships between church and state were so close that the chaplain (Robert Stanser) to the House of Assembly was recommended to succeed Inglis as bishop. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1533))
- In the 1830s, SPG grants were reduced, coming to an end in 1839, and in 1851 the new Bishop of Nova Scotia, Hibbert Binney, was refused a seat in the legislative assembly. Six years later, John Medley, Bishop of Fredericton in New Brunswick, resigned his seat, which marked an end to Anglican establishment. From then on, the Church in Canada would have to support itself, competing on a level playing field with the other denominations. ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1544))
- Following the Quebec Conference in 1851, synods were formed and from 1861 Canada was constituted a separate province. A General Synod met in 1893 which affirmed the desire to remain in communion with the Church of England throughout the world. Identity was to be conferred through the use of the Prayer Book and the Thirty-Nine Articles. The form of Anglicanism that developed in Canada was far closer to that of England than in the United States: bishops came and went between Britain and Canada; ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1549))
- The expansion of the Church of England into the East took a quite different course. From 1698, the East India Company was required to provide chaplains to its trading stations, who had to learn local languages. During the 18th century, the SPCK worked to encourage education among Indians, and, since it could not persuade English clergy to go to India, worked closely with missionaries from Germany and Denmark. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Church Missionary Society, founded by members of the Clapham Sect in 1799, sought to engage with the indigenous population. Claudius Buchanan had been deeply influenced by Henry Thornton and began a chaplaincy to India in 1797. He sketched out a proposal for a bishop for India which came to fruition under William Wilberforce’s influence, with the consecration of Thomas Middleton as first Bishop of Calcutta in 1814. He was closely associated with Joshua Watson and the High Churchmen of the Hackney Phalanx. His primary intention was to serve the English settlers rather than to convert the local population: ‘My public reception was certainly so arranged as not to alarm the natives.’ His… ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1557))
- By 1817, the SPG had decided to redirect its energies to the East. Together with large grants from the SPCK and the CMS this meant that a training College for missionaries could be established. Conflict between the missionary societies soon developed. The CMS proved reluctant to have its missionaries accountable to a bishop whom they regarded as holding dubious opinions. The bishop was also unsure about whether his letters patent allowed him to ordain local missionaries. This situation was clarified in 1823 when an Act of Parliament allowed for Middleton’s successor, Reginald Heber, to ordain Indian clergy. Conflict continued… ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1566))
- During a time in England before his consecration, Broughton came under the influence of the Tractarian understanding of independent ecclesiastical authority. To discuss the issue of political interference, Broughton invited the bishops of Australasia to Sydney in 1850 where a decision was made to introduce synodical government at a diocesan and provincial level: no rights were left with the Crown. Although there was opposition in Britain to synods, out of a fear that they might be dominated by men of dubious churchmanship, Broughton called for unilateral action to remove all legal obstacles. He asked the SPG to organize a meeting with colonial bishops from Canada and South Africa to draft a joint declaration to transfer all authority to the local churches. Broughton agreed to preside over the meeting and to draft a document calling either for reestablishment or for independence. ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1595))
- National and provincial synods were taken up enthusiastically in many provinces, although the Church of England remained opposed. A different version of Anglicanism emerged. The careful balance between lay control and episcopal authority pioneered by Selwyn in New Zealand provided a model for other provinces, even the Church of Ireland, which was finally severed from its links with the state in 1871. ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1602))
- Samuel Wilberforce, who became Bishop of Oxford in 1845, had been one of the leading figures promoting the acceptance of the American Church in 1840: during his researches he came across the idea of the ‘missionary bishop’, developed by Bishop G. W. Doane of New Jersey in a sermon preached at the consecration of Jackson Kemper as Bishop of Missouri and Indiana. Bishops were seen less as overseers of pre-existing churches, and more as pioneer evangelists following the example of the early apostles. As Wilberforce put it in 1838: the task was ‘to send out the Church, and not merely instructions about religion... this is the way in which in primitive times the church was converted’. The visible church in the person of the bishop was the first step rather than final task. ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1606))
- The CBF was closely aligned with the SPG, the largest contributor, and dominated by churchmen with a high view of episcopacy. The CMS was more ambivalent in its support. Henry Venn, secretary of the CMS, took the opposite view from Wilberforce and Blomfield. Churches should raise up clergy and leaders from within: they were to be national churches responsive to their local conditions and should seek civil protection from the colonial legislatures. Venn espoused what was called the ‘three selfs’ for local churches: self-extension, self-support, and self-governance. The principle was put clearly by Hugh Stowell in the CMS Annual Sermon of 1841: episcopacy ‘ought not to anticipate but to follow evangelisation... it is when a country has been evangelised that the episcopate comes in, to crown and consummate the work’. For Wilberforce, Venn’s system was simply a means by which the CMS would gain the upper hand of the bishops. He wrote to James Stephen, Venn’s brother-in-law: ‘Henry Venn is the autocrat of the CMS. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1618))
- The CMS, almost from its beginnings in 1799, worked in West Africa from the base of Sierra Leone. The few Europeans who had gone to West Africa (unlike South Africa) soon succumbed to illness, which meant it was imperative to provide an African leadership. A small group of well-educated local clergy, some of whom had adopted English names, were later to be central in the missionary movements along the Niger River. Many retained knowledge of their African language, which allowed them easier contact with the local population. ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1626))
- the aim of sending the bishop before the flock was gathered was to plant ‘the church in its integrity’, to convert not by the distribution of a Bible but by gathering the heathen into a Christian community with a sacramental life. ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1667))
- After some time, another bishop in communion with Gray was appointed to Natal, adopting the title Bishop of Maritzburg. In England there was confusion about the rights of the two bishops. Convocation said it was in communion with Gray, but refused to excommunicate Colenso. It was clear that something needed to be done to solve the problems of authority: the rights of the English Crown seemed to interfere with the legitimate authority of the independent churches. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1703))
- The effects of the Colenso affair were profound. While not necessarily helpful for Gray and the South African Church, the Colenso ruling was absolutely clear. Where there was self-government, the English Crown had no rights to interfere with the colonial churches. Moreover, four American bishops had been appointed to serve overseas, which would raise the question of parallel jurisdictions. Partly because the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury outside England was not clear, a greater degree of inter-Anglican conversation seemed imperative. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1708))
- A sense of pan-Anglicanism was developing; the term ‘Anglican Communion’ began to be used. In 1860, Gray called for a synod of colonial churches, and by 1865 the Canadian bishops formally requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to convene a synod of all the colonial bishops. Gradually it was felt that this should be expanded to include the independent churches of Scotland and America. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1713))
- jurisdiction and power were unclear from the start: even the Archbishop of York refused to attend out of concern for the possible effect on the role of Parliament or Crown over church affairs. Others were anxious about the dominance of High Church colonial bishops. It was clear that it would be a highly circumscribed meeting ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1725))
- In the event, 76 bishops attended, meeting without reporters. There was intense lobbying on the matter of Colenso; although 35 bishops signed a letter of support for Gray, the subject was not on the main agenda. At the end of the conference, a declaration was issued containing the various reports that had been received. An encyclical letter was published which was also circulated among leaders of other churches. While there were few concrete outcomes, a new pattern had been adopted: a network of men had gathered from across the globe; the archbishop functioned as a primus inter pares and not as an Anglican Pope; matters were debated and discussed, but there was no power to make canons. That it was a collection of bishops without laity was as much a product of the peculiar circumstances of the establishment of the Church of England where lay synodical representation was still a matter of contention. But the effect was that the role of bishops was magnified, which amounted to a victory for the High Churchmen, even if the final resolution called for synods in all places where Anglicanism was not established by law. At the same time, there was little effective central control offered to protect national churches from despotic or heretic bishops: instead, provinces had to do whatever they could to ensure their own checks and balances. History has shown that these have not always been successful. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SHRBD4&location=1728))
- The Anglican Communion formally established itself in 1867, but its powers were curtailed. By 1874, the final settlement of the Colenso case meant that new metropolitans could be consecrated without taking the oath of obedience: this meant they were free from control, even from the Archbishop of Canterbury. His authority, such as it was, was purely moral. Provincial autonomy – begun in very different circumstances by Henry VIII – remained the central doctrine shaping Anglicanism. The nascent national churches became quite independent of one another. What united them was a doctrinal, liturgical, and historical memory, and (in most churches at least) a sense of Englishness. The course of Anglicanism since this first Lambeth Conference has been a fading of memories, a reshaping of liturgy, and, most importantly, a decolonization of the churches.
