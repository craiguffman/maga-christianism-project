### Highlights

- The exact nature of theology in Thomas Aquinas, and its relation with philosophy in particular, is a controversial issue. The discussion is often obscured by our modern (Cartesian or Kantian) understanding of philosophy and reason in terms of autonomy – a view as alien to Thomas Aquinas or Bonaventure as to thinkers of Antiquity (for whom rationality was unthinkable in separation from its constituting tradition). ([Location 4299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4299))
- The readings of those scholars who deny that Thomas allows for a demonstration of the existence of God by the natural light, seem therefore unconvincing.4 ([Location 4313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4313))
- When Thomas calls theology a “science,” he does not use the word “science” in the modern, western sense of the word. For us, “science” involves observation, experimentation, formation of hypotheses, their verification and so forth. Scientia for Thomas is the discovery of reasons in light of first truths that are necessary. Thus, in sciences we demonstrate something unknown from principles that are known. Whereas Augustine called theology a science because it is an organized body of knowledge, Thomas calls it a science because it is based on demonstrative deduction. Just as at the basis of logic there are some self-evident principles (e.g., principle of non-contradiction), so too the articles of faith lie at the basis of Christian theology. Theology is scientific because it proceeds with certainty from principles which it does not prove. These principles are the articles of faith which reveal something of the mystery of God himself who allowed us to share in his self-knowledge (scientia) through his revelation, especially in Christ. ([Location 4316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4316))
- Thomas explains that it was necessary for our salvation that there should be a body of knowledge revealed by God, in addition to philosophical researches. There are a number of reasons for this: first, because the Christian understanding of God as Trinity and other core truths of the Christian faith are beyond the grasp of human reasoning; second, “even as regards those truths about God which human reason could have discovered, it was necessary that man should be taught by a divine revelation; because the truth about God such as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors.”6 ([Location 4334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4334))
- Thomas’ understanding of theology remains indebted to the Anselmian fides quaerens intellectum: theology uses human reasoning, not to prove faith, but to make manifest some implications of its message. Natural reason should assist faith “as the natural bent of the will ministers to charity.”7 Thomas therefore sees philosophy and theology in harmonious terms, although the scope of theology is more universal and broader than any of the other sciences. Theology is distinctive in that it looks at things from the perspective of God’s self-revelation. There are many things that theology does not explicitly deal with, and which are the subject of other disciplines.8 The theologian can sometimes use arguments from other disciplines (e.g., philosophy) to illustrate a theological point, just as a philosopher can use arguments of other disciplines (e.g., physics) to make his (philosophical) point. ([Location 4339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4339))
- All sciences are part of a hierarchy which is crowned by theology (the most universal and noble science). The very idea of a hierarchy of sciences implies that the other sciences cannot truly teach something that is in contradiction to the Christian faith.10 ([Location 4350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4350))
- While Thomas sees the relation between philosophy and theology in harmonious terms, he is emphatic in stating that we should resist any attempt to reduce theology to philosophy: it would be an error to include “the content of faith within the bounds of philosophy, as would happen should somebody decide to believe nothing but what could be established by philosophy. On the contrary, philosophy should be brought within the bounds of faith, as the Apostle says in 2 Cor. 10:5: ‘We take every thought captive to obey Christ.’”11 Responding to the criticism that his views on the harmonious relation between theology and philosophy may appear to be mixing water with wine (Bonaventure’s point), i.e., mingling philosophical doctrines with sacred teaching, Thomas retorts that “those who use the works of the philosophers in Sacred Doctrine, by bringing them into the service of faith, do not mix water with wine, but rather change water into wine.”12 For Thomas this is nothing but an application of his foundational theological stance that grace does not destroy nature but perfects it.13 ([Location 4353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4353))
- Thomas raises the question: “Whether in the Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?” First, a number of objections are listed. The first objection contends that many different senses will only result in confusion; the third objection states that the four senses are not complete, for it does not appear to accommodate the sensus parabolicus, i.e., metaphorical sense, such as when we say “the arm of the Lord.” After these objections, Thomas always quotes an authority (the Bible, a Church Father, or, occasionally, a philosophical authority) who gives a view different from the objections (Sed contra), and which supports the main thesis. In this case, he quotes Gregory the Great (Mor. XX.1): “Holy Writ by the manner of its speech transcends every science, because in one and the same sentence, while it describes a fact, it reveals a mystery.” He then gives his main response (Respondeo dicendum). This is the full response Thomas gives to this particular question: The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to signify His meaning, not by words only (as man also can do), but also by things themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are signified by words, this science has the property, that the things signified by the words have themselves also a signification. Therefore that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the historical or literal. That signification whereby things signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now this spiritual sense has a threefold division. For as the Apostle says (Hebrews 10:1) the Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. I) “the New Law itself is a figure of future glory.” Again, in the New Law, whatever our Head has done is a type of what we ought to do. Therefore, so far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law, there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in Christ, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are types of what we ought to do, there is the moral sense. But so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory, there is the anagogical sense. Since the literal sense is that which the author intends, and since the author of Holy Writ is God, Who by one act comprehends all things by His intellect, it is not unfitting, as Augustine says (Confess. xii), if, even according to the literal sense, one word in Holy Writ should have several senses.15 ([Location 4374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4374))
- Having put forward his own view, Thomas finally replies to the objections. For instance, he argues against the first objection (Ad primum) that multiplicity of senses does not result in equivocation or confusion, as all senses are based on the literal sense. He also makes the point that “nothing necessary to the faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is not elsewhere put forward by the Scriptures in its literal sense” (ST I.1.10 ad 1). This stance illustrates Thomas’ skepticism towards more daring spiritual interpretations.16 In reply to the third objection (Ad tertium), Thomas makes clear that metaphors can be part of the literal sense. Thus, as God obviously does not have a corporeal arm, the metaphor “the arm of the Lord” refers to the divine power, and this is part of the literal sense, in which words (“arm”) refer to things (“power”). This overview of the structure of one of the articles of the ST reveals the dialogical nature of scholasticism. Often the “objections” are powerful, and they assist the reader in looking at the issues from an alternative and critical perspective. ([Location 4403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4403))
- The Barthian rereading of Thomas allows us to rescue him from the clutches of a rigid view on natural theology, such as, for instance, (allegedly) promoted by Vatican I. However, it must be said that it is somewhat implausible. Thomas makes perfectly clear that the Five Ways are preambles to faith, not part of faith itself. They have a different status than, let’s say, the articles of the Creed. Moreover, and more importantly, it was actually a common view amongst both pagan ancient writers, as well as Christian thinkers, that the existence of God could be proved. Aristotle accepted the existence of the First Mover on philosophical grounds, and it seems implausible to attribute a deeper skepticism to Thomas than to Aristotle in this regard. ([Location 4465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4465))
- A third, and more interesting position in this discussion, has been put forward by Denys Turner. Commenting on Vatican I, Turner argues that it was a matter of faith that we can rationally prove the existence of God. According to Turner, the Five Ways are an attempt to prove the existence of God. However, in doing so, we do not know what it is that we are proving. Ultimately, the Five Ways are five rational routes that point to the existence of a Mystery which grounds our own existence: “Reason gets us to where unnameable mystery begins.”21 As he continues: “For Thomas . . . reason’s powers, pushed to their limit, open up into the territory of intellectus: and they do so . . . precisely in the proofs of the existence of God. In those proofs, we could say, reason self-transcends, and by its self-transcendence, becomes ‘intellect’”.22 The bafflement of reason is not done away with by faith: even through the revelation of grace we do not know what God is in this life, and so by grace we are made one with God “as to one unknown” (ST, I.12.13 ad 1). Turner comments: “for Thomas, faith deepens everything that reason knows, including the ‘darkness’ of its knowing. The believer has a stronger sense of mystery than the philosopher, not a weaker. For even if in truth Christians do know by grace and revelation what the philosopher can never know – and they do – such knowledge as faith teaches us can serve only to draw us into a darkness of God which is deeper than it could possibly be for pagans; it is deepened, not relieved by the Trinity, intensified by the incarnation, not dispelled.”23 ([Location 4470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4470))
- The broader, self-transcendent nature of reason echoes Richard of St. Victor’s discussion of the nature of reason and intellect. Thomas shares these views.24 Turner suggests that reason can point towards the existence of the divine but he denies that either reason or faith, give us a clear understanding of God. Turner’s reading therefore avoids two one-sided positions: the naive philosophical view that we can rationally prove the existence of God and that we have a clear understanding of God; and the view that… ([Location 4486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4486))
- Let us first make an important preliminary remark. Thomas is a profoundly negative or apophatic theologian. In De Pot. 7.5 ad 14 (quoted in the epigraph to this book) we find, for instance: “Because our intellect falls short of the divine essence, this same divine essence surpasses our intellect and is unknown to us: therefore, we reach the highest point of our knowledge about God when we know that we do not know him, inasmuch as we know that that which is God transcends whatsoever we conceive of him.”25 Similarly, in ST I.3 he states, before dealing with God’s simplicity, that “we cannot know what God is, but rather what he is not.” In short, throughout his writings (e.g., De Pot. 7.5; ScG I.30 and III.49; De Ver. 2.1 ad 9) he reiterates that we cannot know what God is (quid est) but only that he is (an est). A quiddative knowledge (knowing what God is by grasping his form) would imply that we somehow can grasp God’s essence. Given his sense of divine otherness and transcendence Thomas rules this out altogether. Nonetheless, this negative knowledge does yield some insight. For instance, if you do not know what a human being is, but you know that a human being is not inanimate, your… ([Location 4495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4495))
- Thomas on faith Thomas defines faith as “a habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the intellect assent to what is non-apparent” (fides est habitus mentis, qua inchoatur vita aeterna in nobis, faciens intellectum assentire non apparentibus). Faith is an inchoate participation in God, which can grow and fructify every aspect of our life, assisting us “on our journey towards the enjoyment of God”(ST II-II.1.1) – which is why Thomas writes that through it “eternal life is begun in us.” Faith orients us to God and is a foretaste of heaven in which it will be fulfilled. The main object of faith is the First Truth, or God, and given the fact that this object is unseen in this life, faith relates to things that are not apparent.34 Thomas understands the act of faith as “the firm adhesion of the intellect” of the believer to non-apparent truths. In the afterlife faith will cease as we enjoy the beatific vision of God. ([Location 4676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4676))
- Because we do not attain the full knowledge of God in faith, our ultimate fulfilment or felicity cannot lie in faith. As a matter of fact, Thomas argues that the knowledge of faith does not bring rest to desire but rather sets it aflame, since all of us desire to see what we believe (Cf. ScG III.40.5). Echoing Hugh, Thomas writes that the act of believing is not the same as scientific knowledge (cf. De Ver. 14.2);35 nor is it the same as opinion (you are inclined to go with one view but you cannot rule out that the other view might be the correct one), or doubt (where you waver between two contradictory propositions). In short: faith is between opinion and science. Because the act of believing does not attain the perfection of perfect sight (such as in science), it shares some elements with doubt and opinion. The latter dimension (faith is not sight) explains the restlessness of faith (cf. De Ver. 14.1 ad 5). ([Location 4684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4684))
- Although Thomas sees faith as residing in the intellect (as distinct from the will) this is not to say that the will has no role to play in our act of faith. The act of believing takes place by the command of the will, which, in turn, responds to the stirring of divine grace. You cannot decide for yourself that you will become a believer: it is the result of the operation of God’s grace on the will, which stirs the intellect to give its assent. Thomas puts it in his characteristically crisp manner as follows: “the act of… ([Location 4694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4694))
- We have not discussed the first element in Thomas’ definition, namely faith is “a habit of the mind.” Thomas sees faith as a theological virtue. A virtue is a habitus, a disposition. The best way to grasp this Aristotelian concept is to think of the English phrase “something is second nature” to somebody. Habits have durability, and dispose us towards good or bad acts. In the first case we talk of virtues: they are habits which render human acts good (see ST II-II.4.5); in the latter case we speak of vices. Thomas differs from Aristotle in that he claims that some of these dispositions (habitus) can be divinely produced, rather than being simply generated by society, upbringing and our own practices (ST I-II.51.4). Thomas further distinguishes between intellectual virtues (wisdom, scientia, art), moral virtues (such as temperance or fortitude) and theological virtues (faith, hope and love). The latter are the ones infused by God, who is their object or goal. Faith, thus, is a theological virtue… ([Location 4699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4699))
- the propositional model, where faith is equated with a set of beliefs. A second model can be called a hermeneutical one, in which faith is seen as a perspective on the world. It is not (just) a set of beliefs but rather it offers us a different perspective on the world. The fiducial model understands faith mainly in terms of obedience and surrender – a view which is stressed in Reformation circles but one which Thomas would associate more with hope. Dulles goes on to discuss an affective-experiential model (which puts a distinct emphasis upon the experience of the Holy Spirit in us), a praxis model (which is concerned with the positive impact of faith on tackling socio-economic injustices) and a personalist model (which understands faith in terms of a special relationship with a personal God who communicates himself in love).37 Our exposition of Thomas’ understanding of faith allows us to show how he combines several models. For starters, Thomas adopts the propositional model. After all, the essence of the things we hope for are contained in the articles of faith (Comm. on Heb no. 557). Thomas’ emphasis upon faith as a virtue or disposition, which resides in the intellect, allows us to link his analysis with the hermeneutical model. For Thomas faith is a way of relating to the world (it is, after all, a habitus, a disposition). It allows you to see things that mere reason, or a positivistic approach, cannot see (cf. ST II-II.2.3 ad 3). There is an element of the fiducial model in Thomas’ approach, in so far as he emphasizes that it is the will, in response to the stirrings of God’s grace, which makes the intellect assent (cf. ST II-II.2.9). The affective-experiential model is also accommodated in that Thomas sees faith… ([Location 4711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4711))
- Contemplation In this section, I want to elaborate Thomas’ notion of contemplation and the priority of intellect it implies. The priority Thomas attributes to the intellect is in contrast with later Franciscan thinkers. John Duns Scotus, for instance, will argue that the will is a superior faculty to the intellect, if only because love of God is more important than knowledge of God. Thomas, incidentally, agrees that love of God is better than knowledge of God but he argues, not implausibly, that it does not follow from this that the will is superior to intellect (ST I.82.3). Thomas teaches that all beings desire happiness or fulfilment but our happiness does not consist in an operation of the will. In other words, we desire happiness but this happiness is only attainable if it is made present to us by the intellect. Then our desire comes to an end and finds delight in it. Thomas summarizes: “at first we desire to attain an intelligible end; we attain it, through its being made present to us by an act of the intellect; and then the delighted will rests in the end when attained. So, therefore, the essence of happiness consists in an act of the intellect: but the delight that results from happiness pertains to the will” (ST I-II.3.4). Identifying happiness with the pursuit of happiness itself (or with the act of will) is a major mistake, according to Thomas. Just as the object of sight is not vision itself (i.e., the act of seeing) but visible things; so too the first object of the will cannot be its act: “from the very fact that happiness belongs to the will as the will’s first object, it follows that it does not belong to it as its act” (ST I-II.3.4 ad 2). ([Location 4862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4862))
- Thomas, in line with other medieval thinkers, distinguishes between two acts of the one intellective power, namely ratio (discursive reason) and intellectus (intellect). The latter is the realm of contemplation.The act of the intellect is “to apprehend intelligible truth; and to reason is to advance from one thing understood to another (procedere de uno intellecto ad aliud), so as to know an intelligible truth . . . Reasoning, therefore, is compared to understanding, as movement is to rest, or acquisition to possession; of which one belongs to the perfect, the other to the imperfect.”54 Denys Turner draws out the important implication of this view: “We could not be rational if we were not also more than rational; human beings are not rational unless they are also intellectual.”55 Human reason has a self-transcendent dynamic to it, and it comes to fruition in contemplation, in which intellect takes central stage. Our intellect is something we share with angels who have it in fullness. The act of the intellect is an immediate grasp or intuition of the truth. Usually we have to go through a whole reasoning process to attain this kind of insight; angels have an immediate and timeless grasp.56 ([Location 4875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4875))
- When contemplating, discursive reasoning must be put aside and the gaze of the soul must be fixed on the contemplation of the one simple truth.57 Thus, contemplation, in the words of Josef Pieper, is “a type of knowing which does not merely move towards its object but rests in it. The object is present – as a face or a landscape is present to the eye when the gaze ‘rests upon it.’”58 Contemplation concerns a purely receptive approach to reality, disinterested and independent of all practical aims of the active life. It is pursued for its own sake (contemplatio maxime quaeritur propter seipsam) and not subject to any other goal (ST I-II.3.5). Thus, contemplation is not in the first place an activity but rather a disposition of theocentric receptivity that permeates every aspect of our life. It is similar to what Simone Weil… ([Location 4886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4886))
- Contemplation as an end in itself resists instrumentalization. It consists, after all, in “a certain liberty of mind” (libertas animi) (ST II-II.182.1 ad 2), in “leisure and rest” (quoting Ps. 46:10: “Be still and see that I am God” (ST II-II.182.1)). Moreover, it is contemplation that “redeems” the practical life: the practical life is fulfilled in the contemplative life: “the contemplative life is loved more for its own sake, while the active life is directed to something else (ad aliud ordinatur)” (ST II-II.182.1). Given our preference for things practical this view may strike readers from the twenty-first century as elitist or even “unchristian.” But Thomas’ key point is a perfectly plausible one: after all, the purpose of acts of charity cannot lie within themselves. The alleviation of suffering, for instance, is only a means to an end – i.e., creating the conditions in which other people can enjoy a fulfilled life oriented toward God (i.e., a contemplative life).… ([Location 4897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=4897))
- Bonaventure asserts, “This is the sum total of our metaphysics: emanation, exemplarity, and consummation, that is, to be illuminated through spiritual rays (illuminari per radios spirituales) and return to the Supreme Being (reduci ad summum). And in this you will be a true metaphysician”(Hex. I.17). ([Location 5336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5336))
- For both Bonaventure and Thomas the created world is a vast expression, a symbol (in the sense that it re-presents, or makes present) of the Trinity, and as such it is caught in the dynamism of egressus and reditus.1 In Breviloquium II.12.1 Bonaventure writes that “the created world is a kind of book, reflecting, representing, and describing its Maker, the Trinity, at three different levels of expression: as a vestige, as an image, and as a likeness.”2 ([Location 5343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5343))
- From the fact that the inner-Trinitarian life of God grounds, and is reflected in, the world, Bonaventure, unlike Thomas, concludes that a philosopher who examines it from the perspective of natural reason will fail to perceive its most fundamental dimension. Philosophy is therefore a deeply ambivalent enterprise for Bonaventure. ([Location 5348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5348))
- Exemplarity, the second aspect of Bonaventure’s metaphysics, refers to the view that things have their true reality in the divine ideas. These divine ideas are located in the Word, the Second Person of the Trinity, the eternal archetype through whom God eternally expresses himself in all things, and without whom we cannot understand the most fundamental truths: From all eternity, the Father has generated a Son who resembles him [in whom] he expressed himself . . . He has expressed everything he can do and above all everything he wanted to do, and he has expressed all things in him, the Son, as in a medium and as in his art. This is why this medium is the Truth . . . and this is why no truth whatsoever can be known except through this Truth.4… ([Location 5353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5353))
- But how do we share in the divine truth of the Son? This brings us to his theory of illumination, which also finds its origins in the thought of Augustine, and which will also play a major role in Bonaventure’s spirituality. Bonaventure does not claim that we have a direct knowledge of divine ideas. As a matter of fact, he adopts a version of the Aristotelian abstraction-theory to explain how the intellect gathers its data. However, this occurs only at the lower level of the epistemological scale, so to speak. In order to attain truth, these “data” need to be evaluated in light of the divine ideas, the eternal standards of truth, which we simply intuit and which we cannot, in turn, evaluate. As Christopher Cullen puts it: “The eternal art is that by which we judge, even though it is not the object of cognition. It illumines our judgements, even if it does not provide the objects of those judgements.”5 Thus, the divine ideas are not the obiectum quod of human knowledge – not what we can perceive – but rather the obiectum quo, i.e., that through whose influence we can attain certainty. In a famous quotation from De Scientia Christi 4, Bonaventure explains: “For certain knowledge, the eternal reason is necessarily involved as the regulative and motivating principle (ut… ([Location 5363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5363))
    - **Note:** This looks a lot like Hooker's 2nd eternal law. And like Nyssa's will, think, express.
- In order to appreciate how Bonaventure’s stance differs from that of Thomas Aquinas it is important to remember that illumination, as the condition of possibility of our intellectual processes, is situated somewhere between the order of nature and that of grace.8 It is only in light of his emanationist, exemplarist and illuminist views that Bonaventure’s claim that philosophical reason is in radical need of divine assistance (and cannot operate properly at the ordinary, natural level) becomes intelligible. For Thomas, natural reason, in its… ([Location 5378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5378))
- When it comes to theological reason, even more assistance is required, namely an infusion of grace. Theology, as a kind of wisdom (sapientia), is both knowledge (cognitio) and love (affectum). Theology is “an affective habit” or disposition (habitus affectivus) with both speculative and practical dimensions. For Bonaventure it is mainly practical, namely “that we become good.”9 For Thomas, it is just the opposite: theology is more speculative than practical.10 Bonaventure’s sapiental understanding of theology implies a closer link between theology and spirituality than we find in Thomas: “There is no sure passage from science (scientia) to wisdom (sapientia); a medium must be provided, namely holiness (sanctitas)” (Hex. IXX.3). This is the reason why… ([Location 5384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5384))
- While Thomas allowed for the integrity of philosophical search, Bonaventure’s theological stance results in subsuming philosophy into theology. Given the fact that Thomas allows for a certain integrity to philosophy as a discipline in its own right (albeit ranked lower than theology in the hierarchy of science), it is hardly surprising that Bonaventure is often portrayed as an alternative to the Thomist synthesis, which, in the eyes of some of its critics, has ceded too much to a secularizing outlook. Gregory LaNave, for instance, writes, “‘Bonaventure has seemed to many to hold our hope either for a salutary corrective or even a very different methodology.”11 I will refrain from deciding which perspective is the most appropriate to respond to the (post)secular climate in which we find ourselves. I will suggest later, when dealing with the famous Condemnations of 1277, that the Bonaventurean stance may unintentionally have led to… ([Location 5393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5393))
- Sanctity and learning In a short treatise, entitled On the Reduction of the Arts to Theology, Bonaventure has attempted to demonstrate how all human disciplines have an inner Trinitarian focus and dynamic.23 He is arguing that all disciplines can only be properly understood if their theocentric focus is acknowledged. Bonaventure’s text is indebted to Hugh’s Didascalicon but is more explicitly Trinitarian. Like Hugh, Bonaventure adopts a broad notion of the Arts. It includes the mechanical Arts (e.g., weaving, agriculture, medicine, dramatic art), which provide for our basic human needs, as well as philosophy and its sub-disciplines (rational, natural and moral philosophy).24 In each case, Bonaventure highlights the Trinitarian aspect. The production of artefacts (in mechanical Arts), for instance, implies a Trinitarian dimension insofar as we conceive of things in our mind, and proceed to produce them accordingly. This mirrors the way all things have been made through the divine Word. Even the processes of perception display a Trinitarian dynamic. According to medieval psychology of perception, sense objects stimulate the cognitive faculty only if a kind of similitude, or image, proceeds from the object and moves our senses. This mirrors, once more, the generation of the Word from the Father. These analogies may perhaps strike the modern reader as far-fetched. Bonaventure’s universe is, however, a deeply symbolic or sacramental one, in which creaturely things are the vestiges of the Trinitarian God. ([Location 5557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5557))
- It is only with the eyes of faith that we can truly perceive this inner depth of creation. Bonaventure continues to show how the higher Arts can be “led back” to theology. Natural philosophy, for instance, considers our material world which is, for Bonaventure, the expression of the divine exemplars. Moral philosophy concerns our ultimate fulfilment, which we can only hope to reach when our spiritual faculties have become transformed by divine truth and goodness. Bonaventure concludes that “the manifold wisdom of God, which is clearly revealed in sacred Scripture, lies hidden in all knowledge and in all nature . . . It is clear how the divine reality itself lies hidden within everything which is perceived or known. And this is the fruit of all sciences, that in all, faith may be strengthened.”25 For Bonaventure, all knowledge is a form of enlightenment that finds its ultimate source in the light of God. All knowledge and all disciplines have an inner dynamic that points to their ultimate source: God. ([Location 5570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5570))
- Few theologians have been imbued with such a strong sense of a unified theological and spiritual vision, which is both Christocentric and Trinitarian. It leads to a deeply sacramental approach to the created world, which is seen as a ladder by which we can ascent to God. No theologian has captured the ecstatic character of the Christian life as well as Bonaventure: “Since happiness is nothing other than the enjoyment of the highest good (fruitio summi boni) and… ([Location 5578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5578))
- It is not accurate to call Bonaventure anti-rationalist, anti-intellectual, or even anti-Aristotelian. He is, however, deeply concerned about an independent Aristotelian philosophy, not guided by the light of faith. As he puts it in Hex. VII.13: “only faith ‘separates the light from the darkness’ (cf. Gen. 1:4) . . . Faith, with hope and love and its works, heals the soul and, thus healed, purifies it and renders it deiform.” Again, in Hex. II.7 he writes: “It is a very great abomination that the most beautiful daughter of the king [namely wisdom] is offered to us as a bride, and we prefer to fornicate with a base servant-maid and resort to a prostitute.” It is revealing that Luther was to echo these sentiments. For Bonaventure’s skepticism of Aristotelian philosophy (in its Averroist version) proved influential in… ([Location 5586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5586))
- traditional link between voluntarism and the emergence of science simply does not hold. There were empiricists who were rationalists, and voluntarists who were not empiricists. He reformulates the thesis of the link between voluntarism and the sciences as saying something about the limitations of human intellect rather than about the arbitrary nature of God.4 This is an important nuance. For it makes clear that the real issue was not voluntarism as such but rather the decline of confidence in reason. The modern split between faith and reason is not the result of voluntarism and nominalism; it is the other way around: the critique of natural reason in Franciscan theology (in response to the impact of Aristotelian philosophy) led to voluntarism and nominalism. ([Location 5698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5698))
- Thus, the Condemnations of 1277 both expressed, and contributed to, a different theological climate, in which there was a growing awareness of the limitations of philosophy in its dialogue with theology, thereby reinforcing a growing separation of faith and reason, theology and philosophy. For instance, whereas the immortality of the soul was considered a demonstrable truth for most theologians up to Thomas Aquinas, it will cease to be considered a philosophically demonstrable conclusion by Duns Scotus, William of Ockham and others.5 In general, theologians will rely on revelation and faith more than upon philosophical reasoning to ascertain the truth of theological conclusions.6 The decline of confidence in the human intellect, rather than voluntarism, links Bonaventure’s Augustinian pessimism with that of the Reformers. ([Location 5705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5705))
- It is certainly ironic that the conservative Franciscan reaction of 1277 contributed to the double truth theory, which was rejected by Stephen Tempier, and which is very much part of the modern outlook (due to the influence of Kant which finds a theological response, faithful to the Kantian presuppositions, in the work of Karl Barth and others). In short, I suggest that the Bonaventurean attack upon natural reason had two historical consequences, both unintentional: first, as indicated, there occurs a growing separation of faith and reason. If confidence in natural reason dissolves there will be a tendency to subsume reason in faith. By not respecting the distinction between reason and faith, reason becomes subsumed into faith, and instead of elevating it (as Thomas proposes), we end up abolishing it (fideism), which, ironically, leads to a further separation of faith and reason. Bonaventure’s stance, reinforced by other Franciscans after him, resulted in a gradual separation of faith and reason, theology and philosophy – although its explicit goal is just the opposite, that is, to draw philosophy into the ambit of grace and theology. ([Location 5723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5723))
- In my view, the growing separation of theology and spirituality should be partly attributed to the Franciscan skepticism of reason which finds its origins in Bonaventure’s stance against the new Aristotelian learning: where intellect is silenced, love enters, Bonaventure writes. This may have been a traditional enough dictum but in a climate in which reason and faith are seen as increasingly antagonistic it acquires a more troubling meaning. ([Location 5734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5734))
- whereas Bonaventure himself attempts to bring theology and spirituality together, the attack upon natural reason and philosophy throughout his later works (such as Hexameron) will actually result during the fourteenth century in the growing separation of spirituality from an allegedly intellectualist theology. ([Location 5737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5737))
- Scotus repeatedly commented on Peter Lombard’s Sentences, often revising his views. His early death prevented him from achieving a finished theological synthesis, which further complicates the task of interpretation. Moreover, Scotus is an extremely technical thinker who develops complex metaphysical and theological arguments by rigorously applying Aristotelian logic. His writings can therefore strike the modern reader as dry and overly complex. The fact that Scotus’ surviving writings hardly ever directly engage with, or quote from, the Bible will do little to dispel this impression. Another complicating factor is that, throughout his works, Duns Scotus often enters into dialogue with authors who may not be particularly well known today outside a select field of scholars. ([Location 5783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5783))
- For starters, theology and metaphysics have a different subject. The subject of theology is God; the subject of metaphysics is being.3 Given the fact that metaphysics deals with being as being, and theology with God, a clear distinction, if not separation, between theology and metaphysics is implied. Metaphysics does not just have its own distinct subject but it also has its own source of knowledge: metaphysics draws on natural reason while theology relies on revelation.4 The contrast with Thomas is more radical than may appear at first. As we saw in a previous chapter, for Thomas, theology is scientific insofar as it is deductive system based on the participation in divine (self-)knowledge (scientia). Thus, for Thomas, theology is a subordinate science, i.e., subordinate to God’s own knowledge. Scotus explicitly rejects the Thomist account. How can theology be a science if it is based on principles which are accepted only on the basis of faith?5 Secondly, Scotus questions the usefulness of subordination: there is no causal link between the knowledge or theology of the blessed, and “our theology”: ([Location 5804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5804))
- Following Bonaventure, Scotus argues that theology is more practical than speculative.9 After all, its goal is a loving union with God. Love of God is more important than speculative knowledge of God. This signals a well-known bias of Scotus: the primacy of love and will over intellect. ([Location 5831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5831))
- Thomas’ teaching on analogy presupposes a harmonious co-existence of faith and reason, theology and philosophy. For Scotus, writing after the Condemnations of 1277, theology and philosophy are effectively separate. This will have repercussions for the way he views analogy. Indeed, in Scotus’ view, analogy (especially in the version that Henry of Ghent proposed) does away with the possibility of metaphysics. If there is no bridge between creation and God, all our metaphysical talk about God becomes invalid. This is why Scotus has to insist on the univocity of being. ([Location 5842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5842))
- “Being” when predicated of God and creatures abstracts from all modes of being, and retains only the nature of being as such. In actual existence, however, being is not univocal but analogous: creaturely being is not univocally predicated of God’s being.18 Take the example of wisdom: infinite wisdom is not actualized in God in the same way as wisdom is actualized in creatures. Indeed, wisdom in God and creatures is actualized in an analogous manner, not a univocal manner. Scotus’ theory of univocity claims that we need univocal concepts to speak of God. The univocity theory is a semantic or cognitive rather than a metaphysical theory.19 ([Location 5868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5868))
- Scotus espouses univocity of being in order to avoid all theological statements becoming equivocal.21 In his view, denying this univocal core at the heart of analogy can only result in equivocation, i.e., our language about God becomes effectively meaningless, which would render both theology and metaphysics null and void.22 ([Location 5882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5882))
- Scotus’ theory of univocity implies that a number of concepts apply to both God and creatures: first and foremost being; but also other perfections such as goodness, wisdom, justice and so forth. As I pointed out earlier, this does not commit him to the view that being, wisdom, goodness, are actualized in a univocal way in God and creatures. On the contrary, their actualization would be a case of analogy: in infinite being and wisdom, for instance, “being” and “wisdom” are used analogously in comparison to finite being and wisdom. ([Location 5886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5886))
- In contemporary theological literature, Thomas’ theory of analogy is often favorably contrasted with Scotus’ theory of univocity. We need to tread carefully when comparing their views.23 The most significant difference between Thomas and Scotus relates to roles occupied by divine simplicity and infinity. Simplicity acts in Thomas’ theology, in the words of Thomas Williams, as “an ontological spoilsport for theological semantics.” It seriously complicates our language about God; indeed, it means we do not have a very adequate understanding of terms when applied to God. For Scotus, the emphasis is different: the theory of univocity and the role of infinity in his metaphysics are the conditions of possibility of knowing God and using proper language about him. For Scotus, there is “a harmonious cooperation between ontology (what God is) and semantics (how we can think and talk about him).”24 Thus, Thomas Aquinas’ use of analogy allows him to say that “God is wise” but we do not fully know what it means for God to be wise. For Scotus, however, this results in unacceptable equivocation. Thomas’ understanding of God is more apophatic than that of Scotus, due to the Thomist emphasis upon divine simplicity.25 In my view, the changed dynamics of the relations between reason and faith, philosophy and theology, account for this difference of emphasis. A more narrow understanding of theological and philosophical reason in Duns Scotus, without the self-transcendent dynamic of reason towards theological discourse (as found in Thomas Aquinas) forces Scotus to espouse a univocal concept of being, so as to salvage the claims of metaphysics and theology. ([Location 5890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5890))
- One of the propositions condemned in 1277 was the claim that whatever God does is done of necessity. Perhaps as a response to this, Scotus puts a particular emphasis upon the unlimited freedom of God. Given the fact that we are created out of nothing, we have no claim over God: “in respect to creatures God has no obligations of any kind.”36 Or again: “God does not owe any creatures any of his perfections, for he makes everything out of pure generosity” (mere liberaliter omnia facit).37 ([Location 5963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5963))
- This sympathetic reading of Scotus has been questioned, in turn, by Thomas Williams in a penetrating essay, arguing that God does not have to act in accordance with right reason40: “no other good, apart from God himself, functions as a reason for God’s willing.”41 If something is good or right it is such “not simply on account of the right reason, but insofar as it is willed by God.”42 The will of God is the rule and origin (regula et origo) of justice.43 As Williams summarizes: right reason “does not direct God’s discussion; it merely reports it.”44 He concludes, alluding to the analogy of God as artist, that there are no standards of evaluation independent of God. God can only be considered to be an artist if one acknowledges that he makes up the standards that govern his aesthetic output. Hence, Scotus’ God is “more like Schönberg than like Bach.”45 ([Location 5975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5975))
- Scotus admits that there are necessary moral truths, such as “You shall have no other gods before me” or, implied in this: “God is to be loved.” Thus, God cannot command contradictions, such as the command to hate God. Therefore, not even God could abolish the first two commandments: he cannot permit us to practice idolatry or take the name of the Lord in vain. ([Location 5986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5986))
- But the voluntarism that is undoubtedly present in Scotus’ thought (i.e., God freely decides what is morally good without submitting himself to external standards) does not mean that humans cannot rely on reason to discern what is right and wrong – just as we can discern structure and logic in Schönberg’s works.47 For Scotus, contingent moral truths are immediately accessible to us and we therefore do not necessarily need divine revelation to inform us of their contents. Murder, for instance, is wrong because God wants it to be wrong (and not the other way around: i.e., God does not want murder because it is wrong). But contingent truths, such as the prohibition of murder, are written in our hearts. While they cannot be justified through discursive arguments (by appealing to considerations of human nature, the common good of society), they can be intuitively known. Right reason, then, refers to the correct ascertainment of the relevant moral facts – but the moral facts themselves are freely established by God’s will.48 Hence, in Scotus there is a delicate balance between voluntarism, on the one hand, and right reason, on the other. Future theologians, notably William of Ockham, will also struggle with this tension. ([Location 5994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=5994))
- Generally speaking we can conclude that Scotus’ emphasis upon the gratuity of God’s creative act results in what we might call “facticity” – things simply are the way they are, and we can’t give any further reasons for the way they are (apart from God’s will). This emphasis upon facticity is reflected in a number of issues. For instance, Christ’s saving work is only considered meritorious because God deems it such: just as everything else is good on account of the fact that God wills it, and not the other way around, so also merit had as much goodness as it was accepted to have.49 ([Location 6004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6004))
- Similarly, the same “facticity” can be illustrated by the fact that Scotus refuses to attribute instrumental causality to the sacraments (occasionalism)50; or in his rejection of eudaimonistic ethics. This safeguards God’s freedom, undoubtedly, and does not result in a random, arbitrary creation (as some of Scotus’ critics would have it). But it does mean that we cannot give… ([Location 6009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6009))
- It comes as no surprise that Scotus’ anthropology and ethics are equally voluntarist.51 The freedom of God is reflected in the freedom we enjoy. Now it is the will which is the true seat of human freedom. The assent of the intellect is, after all, determined by its object (when something becomes evident to you, you cannot disagree with it). The assent of the will, however, is in its power.52 Again,… ([Location 6014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6014))
- In relation to ethics: right actions are right because God has freely commanded them, and, as suggested earlier, this command finds its roots in the divine will. This perspective signals a significant departure from the Aristotelian-Thomist eudaimonistic virtue ethics. For Scotus, morality is not tied to human flourishing at all, for he does not entertain the idea that moral norms are intimately bound up with human nature and happiness.53 This moves Scotus’ ethics closer to Kant’s understanding of morality than to Thomas Aquinas’. Incidentally, the… ([Location 6019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6019))
- Redemption is not the fundamental reason for God assuming human nature. The primary reason was the perfection of creation in Christ, the center of the universe. This implies that the Incarnation would have taken place even if the Fall had not occurred. This view is implied in Scotus’ emphasis upon God’s freedom and sovereignty. If the Fall were the cause of the Incarnation, God would have been responding to contingent events in the world. Scotus does not accept this.76 Scotus’ view that Christ’s Incarnation is primarily the result of God’s will to perfect creation rather than to redeem humanity, although not all that original amongst scholastics, proved rather influential in Scotism and beyond. ([Location 6105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6105))
- Scotus’ theory of univocity is not primarily a metaphysical but a conceptual one. Again, while there is undoubtedly a growing voluntarist and individualist tendency in Scotus (when compared to Thomas Aquinas), it is his Franciscan successors who will draw out the more radical implications of these views. ([Location 6128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6128))
- In popular handbooks of philosophy William of Ockham is best known for “Ockham’s razor,” that is, the notion that “beings are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.”1 This exact turn of phrase cannot be found in Ockham’s writings but he does say similar things, such as: “No plurality should be assumed unless it can be proved by reason, or by experience, or by some infallible authority.”2 As we will see, Ockham puts the principle of parsimony (as it is sometimes called) to use throughout his work. ([Location 6438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6438))
- I also want to draw the attention of the reader to the three sources of knowledge that Ockham mentions here: reason, experience and infallible authority. Although there may not be anything particularly striking about these three, two elements will prove important: first, Ockham’s approach is decisively more empirical than that of his thirteenth-century predecessors. Also, unlike Thomas Aquinas, Ockham will simply accept that reason and experience can clash with revealed truth, in which case we should accept the claims of the latter. ([Location 6443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6443))
- William of Ockham strenuously argues against the realism which his thirteenth-century predecessors (such as Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure and John Duns Scotus) shared. They were heir to the realism of Plato and Aristotle, for whom universals are real, and the foundation of universal knowledge. While Plato argued that forms exist in the Realm of the forms or ideas beyond individuals (which share in the forms which “inform” them) Aristotle claimed that forms simply exist within individual things themselves, without having to subscribe to a “separate” realm of forms. Thomas Aquinas later adopted the Aristotelian view. For Ockham, on the other hand, universals are nothing but universal names or concepts. Every mind-independent thing is particular. Only particulars exist in reality. Universality is therefore a feature of signification; it does not refer to the ontological status… ([Location 6448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6448))
- Plato and Socrates both share the universal form of humanity. But if “humanity” (the universal) is a mere name, how can Ockham account for the similarity between different human individuals? Here Ockham applies his principle of parsimony. He replies that Socrates and Plato are similar, not because they have something else in common (e.g., a universal nature) but because they themselves, are similar.4 As Marilyn McCord Adams rephrases it: “Thus,… ([Location 6460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6460))
- Thomas and Duns Scotus had no difficulty accounting for universal knowledge by explaining it in terms of abstraction of the universal form from particular things. They had, however, difficulty accounting for proper knowledge of a particular thing. Duns Scotus’ notion of haecceity (haecceitas) attempted to give due status to the individual thing in its particularity. Ockham takes Duns Scotus’ insight to its extreme, and effectively turns the problem upside down.… ([Location 6468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6468))
- Ockham, however, does not accept there is a universal form in things. There is, therefore, strictly speaking, nothing to “abstract.” Given the fact that Ockham rejects universals he has no need for intelligible species either. We have an immediate apprehension of things, a kind of intellectual intuition of individual things. Again Ockham applies his razor.6 ([Location 6478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6478))
- Ockham’s universe consists of individual things or monads, existing as absolute substances which are unrelated to one another. This view is strikingly different from that of his predecessors.7 This has important implications for his understanding of causality. We can observe that there are causes and effects but we cannot account for these causal relations by establishing any kind of intrinsic connection between things.8 Thus, Ockham interprets causal relations in terms of regular sequences rather than in terms of intrinsic connections. This illustrates his empiricist bias: we can only establish that A is the cause of B by appealing to experience, and not by examining the inner “nature” of A. This understanding of causality results in a severely diminished natural theology. ([Location 6483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6483))
- Given his rejection of universals, Ockham discards the traditional (Neo-)Platonic dynamic of traditional Latin Christian thought. In marked contrast to Thomas Aquinas (an Aristotelian with a strong Neoplatonic bias), Ockham eliminates any traces of Neoplatonism. This becomes particularly evident in his rejection of divine ideas. In Latin theology, divine ideas functioned as the exemplars of created beings. It was this aspect of Christian Neoplatonism that allowed authors as diverse as Augustine, Eriugena, the Victorines and Bonaventure to argue for a sacramental world-view, in which creation manifests and embodies divine patterns or ideas. Now, if universals (such as “humanity,” “caninity”) do not have any real ontological status, as Ockham claims, then divine ideas cannot exist either, for they are, of course, universals. ([Location 6512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6512))
- For Ockham, divine ideas are not the exemplar or blueprint of creatures. Rather, they are nothing but the creatures themselves. This stance concords with his epistemological minimalism. Just as Ockham simplifies human epistemology – for instance, by getting rid of species in the process of perception and cognition – so, too, he argues that God has an immediate knowledge of creatures. When creating things, God does not have to think of universals or divine ideas but he immediately thinks of the creatures themselves.14 In Ockham’s opinion, any theory of essences is in danger of jeopardizing the Christian doctrine of divine freedom and omnipotence.15 ([Location 6518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6518))
- Ockham adopts the distinction between God’s absolute and ordained power, which Peter Lombard had already alluded to in his First Book of The Sentences, dist. 42–43.16 In the thirteenth century (Alexander of Hales; Albert the Great; Thomas Aquinas) this distinction became commonplace, although different theologians understood it in somewhat different ways. For Thomas Aquinas, God’s absolute power refers to everything God can possibly do, while his ordained power refers to the divine power insofar “as it carries into execution the command of a just will” (ST I.25.5 ad1). Thus, for Thomas what God actually does coincides with his ordained power. Punishing the Egyptians or raising Lazarus from the dead are acts of God’s ordained power. Following Duns Scotus, Ockham interprets the distinction between absolute and ordained power in more legalistic terms. For Duns Scotus, for instance, ordained power refers to acting in accordance with the right law, while absolute power refers to the possibility of acting outside or contrary to this law.17 ([Location 6525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6525))
- The implications of Ockham’s understanding of the distinction between absolute and ordained power are subtly different from that of Thomas.19 In Thomas’ view, God selects (“ordains”) a limited number of reasonable options (which may very well be infinite in number). Thus, for Thomas, the ordained power is not contingent – only the absolute power is. Once God has made a choice, it acquires a kind of finality. It follows from Thomas’ perspective that God’s ordained power cannot change. In Ockham’s view, the contingency of the absolute power of God extends to ordained power. For there are many things that are in accordance with the right law that God can do but does not do. This is impossible in Thomas’ understanding of ordained power. Again, for Scotus and Ockham, God’s ordained power can change, and God can, for instance, issue new moral laws. ([Location 6541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6541))
- Although it may not be fair to claim that Ockham’s God, in his ordained power, acts arbitrarily, it is clear that he puts a stronger emphasis than Thomas on God’s freedom to act contingently. As a matter of fact, we are not in a position to attribute arbitrariness to God. Only God decides the worth of a person or an action, and nothing is meritorious save by God’s acceptance. Between virtue and merit lies divine acceptance, “which can only be awarded freely as a gift, not exacted as a due.”26 ([Location 6563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6563))
- Again, God is not bound by sacraments. They are not even an instrumental cause of grace. Rather, by divine ordinance there is constant conjunction between receiving sacraments (such as baptism), and receiving grace. As McCord Adams explains, “this constant conjunction holds, not because of any power – whether natural or supernatural – inhering in the sacrament, but because God wills to produce grace in the soul whenever the sacrament is thus received.”27 ([Location 6567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6567))
- Again, it is not the alleged capriciousness of Ockham’s God which leads to the modern world-view. Rather, Ockham’s works need to be seen in light of the growing chasm between faith and reason which finds its roots in the Condemnations of 1277 – and it is in this separation that we find the roots of modernity. Ockham’s nominalism both illustrates and further contributes to the breakdown of the medieval synthesis of faith and reason. In a world-view in which reason is no longer supported by an intellectual horizon, reason is bound to become more empirical, looking for certainties in the external, observable world; and it may very well clash with key aspects of Christian faith. We have noted that Ockham accepts that reason and faith can clash (for instance, in the theology of the Trinity). In that case, we should accept the truth claims of faith. An “irenic separatism” of faith and reason allows one to do this.31 ([Location 6600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6600))
- It is fair to say that the transcendental thrust, so prominent in earlier writers, has all but disappeared from Ockham’s intellectual universe. I recall the most significant factors which contributed to this. First, there is the nominalist approach itself, which is inherently individualistic and hostile to a more intellectualist intuition of the broader intellectual horizon which grounds our rational engagements with the world. Indeed, given his nominalist stance, it is no coincidence that Ockham rejected a key aspect of Christian Neoplatonism, namely the notion of divine ideas as archetypes through which the world has been created. This undercuts one of the main pillars for the transcendental dynamic which we explored in authors as diverse as Augustine, Eriugena, Anselm, the Victorines and Bonaventure. ([Location 6607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6607))
- Ockham’s strong empirical bias further reinforces the anti-transcendental character of his theological outlook. Ockham applies the Aristotelian standard of evidentness to intellectus, scientia and sapientia.32 In doing so, he is moving towards a reduction of human understanding to mere ratio (reason). In earlier chapters we saw that medieval theologians were of the view that to be rational, we had to be intellectual. In Ockham’s writings, because of a more one-dimensional and empirical approach to human understanding, intellect and reason become severed. In this more empiricist and rationalist universe, theology and faith have become further separated from philosophy and reason, respectively. The result is, ironically, a more fideist understanding of theology, which does not exclude a more empiricist and rationalist outlook on the world. In a sense we end up with two worlds: the world of empirical realities and reason, and the world of faith. From this perspective it is clear that Ockham’s thought moves closer to Luther or Kant than to Anselm or Thomas Aquinas. ([Location 6613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6613))
- It would, however, be inaccurate to claim that Ockham altogether destroyed scholastic theology. Indeed, his arguments in favor of nominalism were not universally accepted; and the end of the fourteenth century saw Ockhamism as just one of the different schools that continued to flourish, besides, for instance, Scotism, Thomism and Albertism. These schools, however, represented the Via Antiqua (the old way); Ockham’s was the Via Moderna.33 ([Location 6629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087GZIF6&location=6629))
- 5 Marilyn McCord Adams, William Ockham (Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1987), 111. One wonders, however, whether Ockham is not simply begging the question – for how can we account for the fact that two things are similar, if not by appealing to something (i.e., a third element within the two things) they have in common and that can only be delineated by referring to what the two things do not have in common?

- 7 In the Aristotelian-Thomist view, things have an entelecheia, an inner telos or goal toward greater perfection or actuality, which mirrors (and participates in) the pure actuality of God. Ockham’s universe is a collection of individuals without real community, which leads him to adopt an empirical notion of causality. See Maurer, The Philosophy, 182–83.
