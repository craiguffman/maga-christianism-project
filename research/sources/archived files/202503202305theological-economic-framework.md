# Theological Critique of Contemporary Capitalism: Framework for Analysis

## Core Theological Concepts

### Freedom as Non-Domination vs. Freedom as Non-Interference

- **Freedom as Non-Domination**
  - Defined as absence of arbitrary power or capacity for domination
  - Requires democratic accountability and participation
  - Views relationships as constitutive of personhood
  - Requires mediating institutions and complex social spaces
  - Aligns with participatory theological frameworks

- **Freedom as Non-Interference**
  - Defined as absence of external constraints or coercion
  - Prioritizes negative liberty over positive participation
  - Views relationships as potential intrusions on autonomy
  - Creates abstract individualism detached from community
  - Aligns with contractual/transactional theological frameworks

### Dominative vs. Creative Power

- **Dominative Power**
  - Operates through subjugation and control
  - Creates relationships of exclusion rather than differentiation
  - Produces what Augustine called the "libido dominandi"
  - Reduces others to instruments for one's own ends
  - Manifests as both market absolutism and nationalistic control

- **Creative Power**
  - Operates through mutuality and cooperation
  - Creates relationships of "differentiation" rather than exclusion
  - Produces what Augustine called an "order of love"
  - Recognizes others as unique persons for gift-exchange
  - Manifests as democratic participation and genuine plurality

### Embeddedness vs. Disembeddedness

- **Embedded Economics**
  - Markets constrained by and accountable to democratic processes
  - Economic activity guided by substantive moral frameworks
  - Recognition that markets depend upon pre-market social relationships
  - Economic policies subject to robust public deliberation
  - Prioritizes common good over individual utility maximization

- **Disembedded Economics**
  - Markets freed from social and political constraints
  - Economic activity guided primarily by efficiency and profit
  - Assumption that markets naturally produce optimal outcomes
  - Economic policies determined by technical expertise
  - Prioritizes individual choice over common goods

## Theological Analysis of Populism

### Appeal of Populism to Non-Elites

1. **Re-politicization**
   - Populism offers return of the political where neoliberalism naturalized markets
   - Acknowledges economic decisions as political choices rather than technical necessity
   - Names enemies rather than abstract forces
   - Promises agency to those feeling powerless

2. **Re-territorialization**

   - Promises restoration of lost status and security
   - Reframes decline as reversible political choice

### Theological Contradictions in Populism

1. **Partial Critique**
   - Correctly identifies domination created by global markets
   - Fails to critique domination itself
   - Replaces global domination with nationalist domination
   - Offers false solution to real problems

2. **Friend/Enemy Distinction**
   - Operates through Schmittian friend/enemy distinction
   - Contradicts theological emphasis on neighbor-love
   - Creates exclusionary rather than differentiated identity
   - Undermines possibility of genuine plurality

3. **Reactive Identity**
   - Forms identity through opposition rather than communion
   - Defines self negatively against others
   - Creates false solidarity based on shared enemies
   - Lacks positive vision beyond restoration

4. **Misplaced Transcendence**
   - Places ultimate hope in national restoration
   - Absolutizes relative goods of nation, tradition, or ethnicity
   - Seeks salvation through political means
   - Lacks eschatological horizon beyond political victory

## Oligarchic Power and "Crack-Up Capitalism"

### Theological Analysis of Oligarchic Alliance

1. **Dominative Alliance**
   - Shared interest in dominative power between populists and oligarchs
   - Mutual opposition to democratic accountability
   - Common desire for hierarchy and authority
   - Joint rejection of complex institutional plurality

2. **False Subsidiarity**
   - Oligarchic power presented as "decentralization"
   - Actually concentrates power in fewer hands
   - Replaces democratic plurality with competing fiefdoms
   - Creates libertarian appearance with authoritarian reality

3. **Instrumentalized Democracy**
   - Democratic language used to legitimate anti-democratic power
   - Elections without substantive democratic participation
   - Popular sovereignty claims without actual sovereignty
   - Representation without accountability

4. **Contradictory Freedom**
   - "Freedom" invoked to justify both nationalist constraint and oligarchic license
   - Liberty for capital, restriction for persons
   - Freedom from regulation for powerful, regulation for powerless
   - Liberation rhetoric with dominating reality

### "Crack-Up Capitalism" as Anti-Commonwealth

1. **Anti-Common Good**
   - Replacement of common goods with private goods
   - Enclosure of previously shared resources
   - Privatization of benefits, socialization of costs
   - Fragmentation of social solidarity

2. **Anti-Koinonia**
   - Prevention of genuine fellowship across differences
   - Creation of homogeneous enclaves
   - Commodification of community
   - Replacement of gift-exchange with transaction

3. **Anti-Differentiation**
   - Erasure of properly differentiated relationships
   - Either forced homogenization or exclusion
   - Loss of generative boundaries
   - Destruction of mediating institutions

4. **Anti-Participation**
   - Reduction of persons to consumers or resources
   - Replacement of citizenship with clientage
   - Democracy as spectacle rather than participation
   - Communion replaced by consumption
