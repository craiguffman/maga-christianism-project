### Highlights

- In my view, Hauerwas is an ideal Barth extension kit, especially for American readers (meaning readers located in the USA). He stretches Barthian categories beyond interwar contexts and European nation-state politics into a postwar setting and a politics salted with the critical purviews of the peace-church tradition (something Hauerwas learned primarily from John Howard Yoder). But critical conversations about Christian formation and community are also inaugurated by Hauerwas with giants such as Alasdair MacIntyre. Barth, pressed through Hauerwas and his key conversation partners, yields a richer, more integrated account of Christian community and of Christian discipleship, which is ultimately what Paul’s Trinitarian and participatory thinking demands.3 My learned readers will detect here, then, where I have seen that Paul is not merely Barthian but Hauerwasian.

- It will not take my readers long to realize that I have used what scholars often refer to as the ten-letter canon. I judge the letter we know now as Ephesians, as well as Colossians and 2 Thessalonians, to be authentic. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=178))

- But since the church has already recognized for some time that the absolute heart of the matter is the triune God revealed in Jesus, it seems that the pressing of this Sache is not only helpful but mandatory. So in the following account Sachkritik will mean pressing Paul’s Trinitarian and Christocentric claims over against any instructions that do not seem to be grounded particularly securely in those realities—places, that is, where Paul must reinterpret Paul.9 This technique, besides being an education into the theological method, will prove helpful as we think about how Paul’s dynamic thinking can help us today. He did write his letters a very long time ago, in a different language, to people living in a society that was vastly different from ours. We need to grasp Paul very clearly, but then go beyond him, by standing on his shoulders. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=214))

- God is definitively known only in Jesus. This is where God is present with us fully, and nowhere else—not in a book, a tradition, a piece of land, a building, or even in a particular people (unless, that is, he has taken up residence in one of them fully). We worship and pray to none of these things; we worship and pray to Jesus because Jesus is God, and so we know God fully and completely only as we know Jesus. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=360))
- Accurate God-talk is Jesus-talk. And God-talk that is not in some very direct sense Jesus-talk is probably not God-talk. Jesus is the key piece of information concerning God, in the light of which all other God-talk must be evaluated, which includes everything in this book and everything that Paul wrote. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=368))
- God has been definitively revealed, in full, without reservation, in a person—specifically in a Jew who walked the earth in the early first century and was executed by the Romans around 30 CE. But he was then raised from the dead and enthroned on high, from where he rules the cosmos beside his divine Father, right now (to anticipate a few of our later findings).7 An entirely new approach to life is necessary if the claim concerning Jesus’s lordship is correct, one alert to the resurrecting power of Jesus working away within history. The way we explain Paul must follow accordingly. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=379))
- Paul attributes the cause of the conviction about the lordship of Jesus to the call of God the Father and the activity of the divine Spirit,9 and here we see a third divine actor taking the stage in addition to the Father and his Son. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=414))
- Dismayed by the political wreckage that surrounded him in Europe—two world wars fought with one another by historically Christian powers, along with the hard-heartedness of his middle- and upper-class parishioners to the plight of their factory workers—Barth detected an underlying theological crisis that we will constantly revisit. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=426))
- He saw that modern Protestant theology had taken the route Paul rejected in his letter to the Corinthians: the high road of educated sagacity and public eloquence that sought to establish the reality and nature of God through human inquiry, beginning with doubt and then trying to construct some definition of the truth that led to God. What was needed was a return to the simple truth known so well by previous epochs in the church: the acknowledgment that the truth of God rests in the hands of God and not in the hands of humanity. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=428))
- God reveals the truth, and people respond to it (thereby constituting the church), so the theological journey begins after the fact of belief and reflects back upon it, studying, even as it prays to and worships the truth that has been revealed. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=431))
- At the root of the truth attested by the church in every age and in every person is the simple recognition that God is at work revealing his nature and purpose, and that this nature and purpose are so definitively revealed in the figure of Jesus that we must acknowledge the truth that this crucified figure was and is God and hence God in person, although, as we have just seen, Paul spoke in biblical language here of Jesus as Lord. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=435))
- we know this truth about God because it has been revealed to us by God.11 The truth has revealed the truth. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=439))
- we have learned that Jesus is God the only way we could—because God has told us that. “I am fully in this person” has been spoken to us at some point in some way by God, and we have believed it. In essence, then, Barth grasped with particular clarity that the truth at the base of the church rests on revelation—a particular revelation by God about the person Jesus, who is God, and hence one that is particular both in mode and in content. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=443))
- In Greek the language of revelation speaks of unveiling something. To unveil is apokalyptein, and an unveiling is an apokalypsis, from which we get our words “apocalypse” and “apocalyptic.” ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=453))
- Apocalyptic language in this sense will help us to talk accurately about the centrality of divine revelation for understanding Paul, and for understanding the truth affirmed by the church in general, whether in its messianic Jewish or Christian variations. Jesus is the Lord, and hence part of the divine identity. This is the focal point of the church’s truth. And its truth rests on revelation. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=459))
- This is the particular content of revelation—that Jesus is Lord—and the church knows it because this particular truth has been revealed to it. In short, the Lord has revealed the truth to us about the Lord. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=462))
- To affirm a revelation of the truth that Jesus is Lord as a revelation of God to us is consequently and necessarily to affirm a threefold activity by God in three different places: the Father sending Jesus into the world (i.e., sending him here from some other place); Jesus being sent into the world, specifically to Galilee and Samaria and Judea; and the Spirit revealing this to us wherever we are. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=480))
- When I make claims to my students about the nature of the church’s truth like those I made in the previous chapter, I usually encounter a polite “but . . .” from some of them. I completely understand people who say “but . . .”; however, I invariably go on to argue quite firmly that the introduction of a “but” here will subvert the entire basis of our truth, and therefore it needs to be avoided at all costs. Jesus’s followers need to learn not to say “but” at this moment. Indeed, this “but . . .” needs to be repented of. The desire for an independent starting point for truth was, it should be recalled, the sin that led to the expulsion of humanity from the garden of Eden and to the arrival of death. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=707))
- To say “but . . .” to the basis of truth in the revelation of God in the person of Jesus is not just a slip in epistemology—the sort of thing that might bother students in a divinity school but few others. It is a critical sin that results ultimately in the erosion of pretty much everything else that is important. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=713))
- we are grounded in the truth because we have responded positively to the divine disclosure that Jesus is Lord. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=719))
- The revealed truth about the nature of God in Jesus is a gift from God to us, and this particular gift is one over which we have absolutely no jurisdiction. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=729))
- The very giftedness of this truth, which comes all the way down to us, levels us all permanently and irrevocably in relation to one another. Everyone acknowledging this truth is placed on the same plane. None of us could access for ourselves the most important truth about reality, so humanity is radically equalized by this arrival, technically, in its incapacity. The gift of the truth about Jesus as Lord tells us that we all needed this gift and had nothing to contribute to it in advance. We are, then, in effect, all revealed by it to be equally stupid in and of ourselves. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=737))
- Like Antonius Block, the tortured knight in Ingmar Bergman’s classic film The Seventh Seal, we are playing chess with the devil. If we win, we will escape with our lives. If we lose, we will be dragged off with our companions in the dance of death. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=755))
- Although we hear it all the time, this challenge is a trap; it beckons before us like an open doorway into the smoothly reasonable discussions of the academy and beyond. It is so common that I want to spend some time in the rest of this chapter unpacking it and then supplying several important reasons why we should resist it, standing firm within the revelation of Jesus by Jesus.2 Our questioner is really posing a question about truth criteria, asking us to introduce another set to evaluate the one that we already have. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=765))
- the basic truth criterion for the church is the lordship of Jesus, which is to say, the God whom Jesus embodies with complete fullness. And I have emphasized that we know this about Jesus because it has been revealed by the Lord to those who follow Jesus. So this truth claim is active and essentially reveals itself. God in person present with us is the truth, which is our central truth criterion as well. Everything else now needs to be measured against this truth criterion ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=776))
- However, people who are not responding overtly to the disclosures of God in these terms understandably reject this criterion as the ultimate measure of truth. They bring different measurements to bear on every question, including on this one. Consequently, the questioner in our university seminar (a woman, let us assume), is asking us to place our claim about Jesus, and hence our truth criterion, underneath hers to be measured—an entirely reasonable procedure from her point of view, but an entirely fatal one from ours. She wants to measure my truth by her truth criterion and to encourage me to do the same. It is here that the gambit is offered and must be firmly declined ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=782))
- If we do this—if we accept this request and, in effect, start playing this game—then we place another truth criterion over the top of God to judge God, who is our truth. Hence this move turns out to be a denial that God is the ultimate truth. God is merely a truth and no longer the supreme truth, which is to say, the truth. We have thereby abandoned our initial… ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=787))
- As a friend put it to me once, by making this move, abandoning the living God as the ultimate source of truth, we have not just shot ourselves in the foot; we have shot ourselves in the head. We have done so, moreover, in defiance of what God has chosen to do for us. We have stepped back from God’s gracious personal involvement as the truth in our own situation and have accepted the idea that an… ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=792))
- The Bible prohibits this move in one of its most obvious variations in the first warnings of the Ten Commandments, and an important connection to the phenomenon of idolatry is also made apparent here, along with the appalling consequences of lapsing into this situation.4 We are to have no other gods before our Lord God, which is to say, no other gods beside the God who has revealed himself to us as the Lord, the Lord who delivered the Hebrews from Egypt and who lives in the resurrected Lord Jesus. Moreover, we are not to try to image this God. The imaging of God is the province strictly of God; the depiction of God is in the hands of God and of God alone. To try to image God for ourselves, thereby to construct an idol, is… ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=799))
- A more technical name for the procedure whereby we elevate our own truth criteria over the truth that is God, ultimately to judge God’s truth or falsity, is “foundationalism,” which denotes here our provision of a different foundation for truth from the one that God has laid for us… ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=809))

- Any such philosophical attempt to construct a perfect foundation for all thought and knowledge is indeed a form of foundationalism.

- When Jesus’s followers have accepted what I earlier referred to as the truth gambit, thereby undermining the basis of their own truths claims about Jesus by adopting another set of truth criteria by which to measure their own claims, they have gone off and built their own foundation.

- the recognition of Jesus’s divinity in relation to his lordship, which Paul affirms explicitly and unambiguously after Jesus’s resurrection and heavenly enthronement (see Phil 2:9–11; also Rom 1:4; 10:9–13; etc.), combined with the revelation of Jesus’s limitless compassion through his death for the sinful and ungodly (Rom 5:5–6), results in a solid theological inference to election in the terms I have described in this chapter, and hence to Jesus’s divinity. A Pauline account of election must then be understood in fully Athanasian terms, and in the compassionate terms that Barth articulated, even though Paul’s account of Jesus’s preexistence and later divinity arguably has an adoptionist side, and his account of election is not always stated in universal terms.

- We will share in the Son’s resurrected humanity. This is joined in him to his divinity in the hypostatic union—but only in him. In the Son the two natures are inseparable but also distinguishable, and not to be mixed or confused together. Just so, we, as bearers of Jesus’s resurrection humanity, will always be distinguishable from the divine nature and never mixed or confused with it. But we exist inseparably in relation to it with the intimacy of the hypostatic union—an extraordinary gift given originally in the condescension of the incarnation. How close has God drawn us? As close as this. ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=1908))

- We can count fifteen distinguishable problems that Paul addresses in 1 Corinthians. (Technically, two of these aren’t big problems yet, but they soon will be, as evidenced by 2 Corinthians.) Paul will spend a great deal of time over the next six months unscrambling this toxic tangle—a task complicated by the fact that his teaching was contributing to some of the tensions, especially by way of his hard line on sexual activity.

- Partisanship (1:10–4:21; 16:10–18). The Corinthians have factionalized behind different leaders. Some follow Paul, some Cephas, and some a rival called Apollos. Some might even have formed their own “Christ party.” Disrespect for rival leaders extends to their followers, so, at the end of the letter, Paul has to ask the Corinthians to respect Timothy and the leadership of the humble household of Stephanas.

- Because Jesus arrives as a revelation and hence unexpectedly, in a way that cannot be anticipated, we had to learn to tell the story about him retrospectively, or backward. As in a memoir, we look back on our past in the light of the present flash of revelation, and things become clear in its light. We dubbed such a plot epiphanic.

- if we ignore this dynamic and tell the story of Jesus forward, like a quest, aware all the time of what we are looking for, we surreptitiously introduce a set of truth criteria in advance of Jesus, and by introducing that set we undermine his ultimacy. We know the truth about him before he arrives, and it follows that Jesus himself is not then the truth, from which mistake disaster must ensue. In just this manner, when we begin to talk about “a problem” to which God acting in Jesus is “the solution,” we might reinstate foundationalism. If we introduce our account of the problem first and work forward, rather than introducing the solution first and thinking backward to the implicit definition of the problem, we tell the wrong story and unleash the three horsemen.

- My problem at work is you, your attitude, and your inadequate skill set. Our problem is vast climate change caused by massive use of fossil fuels, which, ultimately, is causing the earth’s atmosphere to heat up. The problem our society faces is inequality brought on by tax cuts for absurdly wealthy people and the financial starvation of welfare programs for the least advantaged among us.

- Once we have stated the problem in each of these cases, it is clear what the solution is. The problem defines “the space” where the solution must fit so that the solution bolts onto the problem into the space already prepared for it, like a tire onto a car wheel. The place for the solution and the exact shape of the solution have already been prepared. “You are my problem at work.” “Fossil fuel use causes dangerous climate change.” “Flat tax rates result in inequality and diminished government revenue and related programs of redistribution.” (“My problem is a flat tire.”) All the critical analysis in these different dilemmas has been done by the definition of the problem. Solving them just involves enacting the solution that we already know.2 And there is something very seductive about this way of working. It seems to be the right way of proceeding in terms both of history and of rationality. ([Location 1989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=1989))

- As we have seen from the outset of this book, history is not open to us in its fullness or subject to our control. God holds the complex interrelational process that is history in his hands and shapes history, so the truth about history must include both internal and external causes, and we can know what the most important external cause, God, is like and is doing only if God tells us. It doesn’t matter how hard we scratch our heads here about what problems we face. We need God to inform us of certain key things. A problem-solution sequence that we are driving is not going to work.

There is no rational road from the deficiencies of Newtonian physics to the seminal truth that the key constant in the cosmos is the speed of light; there is an imaginative leap to an entirely different metaphor for how reality works.4 So a simple rationalistic problem-to-solution story is naive, even from the point of view of modern science, and is doubly so for anyone on a… ([Location 2008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2008))

- Paul’s particular Jewish faction, the Pharisees, supported the prospect of resurrection enthusiastically,10 even if they too probably differed on the details. Hence Paul was trained in all the key texts and ideas before he encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus. As a result of this preparation, the right terminologies and conceptualities for Paul to articulate what had happened to Jesus lay just to hand. When Jesus revealed himself to Paul near Damascus, Paul knew that he was in the presence of resurrection. However, a resurrection had now happened, so Jesus gives definitive shape from this moment onward to Paul’s broader Pharisaic expectations. Paul no longer possessed resurrection hopes and thoughts and reflections, we might say; he had a resurrected person to be guided by. So we see further precision emerging concerning all these expectations as Paul develops them in his letters. ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2040))

It is the state and the pursuit of shalom, which is a deep wholeness and enjoyment of life when it is ordered as it should be. The resurrected mind is at peace with God and with itself, while it pursues peace within its communities (Eph 4:3).

- Paul’s longest description of the unresurrected mind can be found in Rom 7.3 There he states that part of a human mind might recognize the goodness of God’s divinely gifted instructions in the Torah, and even enjoy them: “In my inner person I delight in God’s instructions.” So things are not all bad. Nevertheless, these instructions will not be carried out. “I do not understand what I do. Because I do not practice what I want, but what I hate—this I do!” (7:15), an observation repeated many times through the paragraph that follows. The chapter explains this struggle by infusing this struggle with the story of Adam (and Eve) in the garden, suitably modified. Paul speaks specifically of the tenth commandment, which forbids coveting: “Do not desire. . . .” This command in its original biblical context prohibits any covetousness or lust for a neighbor’s wife, male or female servant, ox, donkey, or anything else that belongs to the neighbor. But Paul goes on to observe that the divine prohibition against lust creates the desire to do these very things when an evil force that Paul here calls Sin, like the snake in the garden of Eden, deceives the human agent and generates all manner of covetousness. It thereby utilizes the presence of this prohibition to subvert it. “… ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2330))

So Paul’s observations certainly resonate with common human experience. But he supplies a powerful explanation for the presence of this painful experience, sharpening its depth and consequences beyond this psychological dynamic. We get the sense that some hostile force occupies human nature and both deceives and enslaves it—the human passions or lusts… ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2346))

- It is worth recalling now that the mind of Flesh is characterized by conflict—where there is enough moral awareness to generate this conflict, perhaps through the presence of a divine command in Scripture—and by hostility to God. When Paul describes the person of Flesh in Rom 7, as we have just seen, sinful desires, perhaps here better translated “lusts,” exploit even God’s righteous instructions, with the result that sins are multiplied. They thereby “wage war” on any good elements within the person and “enslave” the person as a whole to habitual wrongdoing. Any remaining “inner” part of a person that desires to do the right thing looks on helplessly at this outward wrongdoing, crying out for rescue like a pitiful slave (vv. 23, 14, 22, 24). The person currently exists in a hopelessly conflicted state. “I do not understand what I do but the good that I want to do I do not do, and the evil that I do not want to do—this I do” (paraphrasing parts of vv. 15–20). And this internal conflict extends to a posture of enmity toward God. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2361))

Any quick attempt to achieve ethical perfection alert to this position will then only confirm it. We lust, all of us, for something, however trivial. The point is not that God is then angry with us and sentences us to death. The point is that we want to behave rightly but that any attempt to do so, and especially when undertaken in the light of the most important set of moral directives available, the Torah, exposes our inadequacy almost immediately, from which it follows that we do sin and that we do therefore have a problem with death.

- In the light of all this material, which appears throughout Paul’s writings, it seems that the origin of sin did not lie directly in Adam. Evil forces achieved access to the world of humanity through Adam’s stupidity and thereby threw God’s earthly creation into disarray.8 But they preexisted Adam’s transgression. Evil lived outside of him and beyond him. It was not innate to his nature or to his situation. The evil powers achieved this entrance into the cosmos through deception and then occupied it, rather like an oppressive colonial invader. Sinful humanity now sins, in part, because it has been colonized, although Adam opened the door to this invasion and must take some responsibility for it (noting, in addition, that in 2 Cor 11:3 Paul blames Eve). As a result of this combination of stupidity and gullibility, humanity now lives browbeaten by powerful forces that seduce and exploit people and human structures to achieve evil ends, most obviously effecting the crucifixion of Jesus (1 Cor 2:6, 8).

- This, then, is the problem of sin that humanity faces—life in a nature that is prone to lustful sinning from within and, from without, prone to constant assaults from deceptive and evil forces. Small wonder that God steadfastly maintains the judgment of termination. That judgment is a refusal to extend life permanently to a contaminated cosmos, resulting in an existence that is limited, declining through steady corruptibility to death. We know already, however, that resurrection will restore God’s great plan for eternal fellowship with those who bear Jesus’s image in the age to come. Death will not have the final answer, and sin will be quarantined and cut off as this age perishes. However, Paul has emphasized that the baptized possess a resurrected mind in the present. It is one of his most extraordinary, repeated, and important claims that the age to come and its eschatology have been inaugurated now. But why?

- There is a sense in which God could have waited to resolve our problems by resurrecting us only after we die and lifting us then into the age to come. This sequence would eliminate sin, exclude evil, and re-create the cosmos in the fellowship that it was destined for. But in the meantime it would leave us struggling away where we are, in the old cosmos. Jesus’s resurrection would certainly give us hope. We would know that death will not have the last word, and the coming of the future age will be assured. But the gift to us now of a part of the age to come in the form of a re-created mind brings the re-creation of that age into our current situation. The result is that we can live and act in an obedient, peaceful, and loving way within the old age, immediately. Put a little more technically, we can say that under this arrangement, God gifts us with agency, which is to say, with the ability or… ([Location 2424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2424))

- There are two distinguishable but ultimately inseparable parts to this solution, however, that we now need to think about a little more deeply. First, Jesus assumes our nature of Flesh, executes it on the cross, then travels through death to resurrection life, rising in a new, cleansed, and liberated condition. So, as Paul puts it pithily in Rom 4:25, “He was delivered for our transgressions and raised for our deliverance.” Second, we are somehow connected to his journey, concretely, so that the termination and resurrection he experienced are determinative for us as well… ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2432))
- The only detail we need to add here is the evidence that his death was an execution of our contaminated Flesh. He entered into our condition—the technical term is that he assumed it—and so our Flesh died on the cross with him and was terminated there. “One on behalf of all died, therefore all died,” Paul states in 2 Cor 5:14b, reiterating in verse 21a that “the one not knowing sin was made sin for us.” Paul basically indicates this work of Jesus on our behalf whenever he says that Christ died “for us” (or in some subtle variation on this).9 He also says that Jesus carries our burdens. So, similarly, when we carry burdens, we “fulfill the Torah that is Christ”; we follow a burden-bearing God.10 Paul summarizes these… ([Location 2438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2438))
- is worth pausing at this moment to grasp what this burden-bearing tells us about God. God does the right thing in refusing to extend life indefinitely to a cosmos that is contaminated by evil. (Of course, we don’t really make this judgment of God’s actions for ourselves; we learn that this is a correct judgment from those actions.) This refusal to endorse the ongoing existence of sin is the divine judgment on sin. The Flesh must spiral into the consequences of its turn away from God and be extinguished. In short, it must be allowed to die. But even as this judgment is followed implacably, God takes this burden directly upon himself. So God initiates judgment, frames its nature, and also makes a… ([Location 2449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2449))
- little more detail. We are part of Jesus’s journey and new life. We are not resurrected entirely, and we will talk shortly about the tensions this apparent partiality generates; but our resurrection has begun. Paul is quite clear on this point. His favorite way of expressing it is by saying that we are “in Christ” (or some similar wording). He uses this expression upward of 160x in his letters, and often in highly strategic locations. ([Location 2461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2461))
- Both the cosmic spread of God’s work in Jesus and its creative depths are signaled by the way Paul opposes this life in Christ to life as it is shaped by Adam, something he articulates especially in 1 Cor 15. ([Location 2479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2479))
- But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. (vv. 20–22) ([Location 2481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2481))

- Most people in the ancient world owned only one set of clothes, the generally ragged and dirty set they were standing in, so a gift of clothing would have been clean and fresh and rather special.15 But in Rom 6 Paul does not interpret this ritual in terms of cleansing, which water and clean clothes might first suggest. It is these things, but it is also more. The immersion is a participation in the death, burial, and resurrection of ([Location 2507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2507))
- Of course, there is an obvious sense in which converts are not yet fully resurrected. A future aspect of resurrection is still apparent. Paul notes this, among other places, in Rom 8. If [the Spirit of] Christ is in you, on the one hand, the body is dead because of sin, but, on the other, the spirit is living because of God’s righteous deliverance.16 Hence, if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, ([Location 2523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2523))
- then the one who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your mortal bodily parts alive by means of his Spirit dwelling in you. (vv. 10–11) ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2529))
- But this resurrection, although future in part, is not entirely so. Paul goes on to speak of its present effect as well. This is the point of the first third of the chapter. Those who are led by the Spirit of God—these people—are sons of God. . . . You have received a Spirit of sonship, by means of whom we cry “Abba, Father.” (8:14–15) ([Location 2531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2531))
- It is this cry in the present, in the Spirit, that guarantees a future fullness of resurrection. At the very same moment, it is the Spirit, present alongside our spirits, who allows us to live obedient lives now, a point Paul has emphasized from verse 1 onward. We “walk” according to the Spirit he says in verse 4, which is a Jewish expression for living obedient lives following the pathway laid down by God’s teachings. And shortly he adds, “The mind of the Spirit is life and peace. . . . Therefore, we are obliged . . . to put the practices of the body to death” (vv. 6, 13). ([Location 2535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2535))
- Second, he has thereby grasped that participation in Jesus has ethical force. Those who live a new life in Jesus now, beyond death, also live beyond an existence of Flesh, possessing the very different resurrected and reconstituted mind of the Spirit. Their Flesh has been executed, and they live out of a new mind of peace and can act accordingly. The details and implications of this new reality will occupy our discussion now for quite some time. ([Location 2542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2542))
- our past is caught up in thinking that is corrupt. ([Location 2551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2551))
- We can now see that we are telling the story of Jesus, broadly speaking, in the way that addicts recount the stories of their recoveries. These are stories that make complete sense only when their tellers look backward on their past. They are stories that pivot on a definitive revelation—the step from full addiction to being clean, with its attendant clarity. And they are stories that emphatically do not make sense before these moments of clarification and reflection. Prior to these moments any storytelling tends to be self-serving and destructive. ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2555))
- But of course I did not tell this story prior to entering rehab, when I was in the grip of my habit. Then I spoke very differently. I never said at that time, in the full throes of alcoholism, that I was an addict, out of control, and enslaved. I said the very opposite. “I am in control of my drinking and doing just what I want,” I would assert; “In fact, I’m having the best time of my life. No one is getting badly hurt by my behavior. It’s just harmless fun. And I can give it up any time I want to. I’m not like those sad alcoholics over there.” Of course, with a mind clarified by rehab and free from the distortions of the drug itself, this narrative is revealed to be utterly delusional. ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2568))
- We can see where our constant collaboration with sin has led to destructive behavior, and where this activity has been intertwined with destructive thinking. And we confess now both the center of our lives and the key point of our developing clarity, namely, Jesus, and our commitment to letting his clarity penetrate more deeply into our distorted and twisted minds, aided by the Spirit, showing us, among other things, how destructive and broken we are. ([Location 2577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2577))
- Any account of sin, in short, must be undertaken in a confessional mode. Looking back, in the light of Christ, we confess our previous actions to be sinful, and we generally know rather better than we did before just what to confess. ([Location 2589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2589))
- Paul belonged to a religiously motivated death squad, to a terrorist cell. Like some terrorists, he was completely sold out for God and was clearly working hard to do God’s work. But the revelation on the road to Damascus of God’s very nature in the person of Jesus Christ revealed in the same moment the utter, total, and complete misdirection of his zeal. Instead of accelerating ahead of the pious crowd, winning the race for Jewish virtue, Paul was deeply and profoundly mistaken about God, God’s nature, and God’s purposes—so much so that he was zealously opposing God, fighting against the very God he thought that he was serving. This all became apparent no doubt when God was revealed to Paul in Jesus on the road to Damascus. From this event onward Paul’s story changes dramatically, including his account of his past. The zealous Pharisee is a zealous misdirected Pharisee. The one viewing Jesus then in a merely “fleshly” or “human” way does so no longer but sees him as the very creator inaugurating the glories of the age to come (2 Cor 5:16–17). ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2597))
- With this reinforcement of our retrospective purview on the past in place, we are ready to turn back to the question of the present. God has broken into our situation and has freed us from our twisted and addicted minds of Flesh so that we can begin to think more clearly about him and simply to respond more obediently to him. We have the mind of the resurrected Christ, Paul says (1 Cor 2:16). ([Location 2617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2617))
- According to Paul, we are in some sense presently resurrected within Jesus. In particular, we have the mind of the risen Jesus and can live at peace. This contrasts with an unresurrected mind. Paul explains this contrasting, conflicted mind by using two stories: Gen 3 and the powers (i.e., fallen and evil heavenly rulers under the overall control of Satan). ([Location 2622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2622))
- God solves this situation for us presently, in two ways. First, Jesus takes up our condition of Flesh, executes it, then is raised from the dead in a new form, liberated from Sin’s lusts and free from a world where the powers roam. Paul speaks clearly of what Jesus has done for us here in assuming our sinful Flesh, and he speaks in addition of how Jesus carries our burdens. ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2636))
- This judges our sinful condition by terminating it and provides a new form for humanity that is free from infiltration and occupation by sinful lusts. Second, we are concretely joined or connected to Jesus’s journey in some way, so that we possess a resurrected mind now. Paul’s favorite expression for this connection is that we are “in Christ.” But he also speaks of how we are caught up in a new creation that is superior to Adam’s and is spiritual as against earthly. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2641))
- This resurrection must, to some degree, be present. As such, and only as such, it has ethical force. This all speaks of the divine love for us clearly as well, although to a near incomprehensible level. God judges sin, refusing to extend life to it, but he also takes that judgment upon himself and bears it in order to create a pathway out of it. The claim that we are concretely transformed in Jesus is expressed by the ritual of baptism; see especially Rom 6:1–11.

- Paul’s main concern in Philippians is captured by the verse that begins the famous passage that has informed much of our discussion thus far: “Think this among yourselves, which is also in Christ Jesus,” Paul writes in 2:5, going on in verses 6–8 to describe Jesus’s self-effacement in the incarnation and the crucifixion. This emphasis in verse 5 on the centrality of the mind of Jesus to right behavior is then found in many other places in the letter.

- We infer from elsewhere that this peace is derived by way of “fellowship with the Spirit” (2:1), as well as through “fellowship with [Jesus’s] sufferings,” “conformity to his death,” and “knowing the power of his resurrection” (3:10). It is apparent, then, that Paul constantly urges his Philippian converts to live out of the mind of Jesus, available through the Spirit, expecting this factor to concretely change a congregation that seems to be threatened with internal fracture.

We live in vulnerable, mortal bodies that die, largely because we think fleshly thoughts and sin. At the same time, we possess a resurrected mind from Jesus and the Spirit. This is a very different mind from the mind of the Flesh, being attuned to the concerns of God and at peace in following those.

- Fortunately, the Spirit is a “deposit,” or “down payment” (2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; Eph 1:13–14; 4:30), who brings gifts and virtues in the present (Rom 12:3–8; 1 Cor 12 and 14; Gal 5:22–23), thereby guaranteeing the perfected state that lies ahead. We have already seen Rom 8:9–11 speak of this guarantee. Hence, despite all the struggles, the presence of the Spirit now, in love, peace, and joy, brings “hope.” Paul cannot exactly see all these resurrected realities, and certainly cannot yet see “the glorious freedom of the children of God” (8:21). This freedom will become apparent only after we have been liberated from our slavery to mortality on the great day of Jesus’s return. All of creation is waiting for this moment—this flash of cosmic revelation—but it isn’t here yet.

- Insofar as we are modern Westerners, we tend to view thoughts as separate from acts. We think, and then, in the light of this thought, we act. Moreover, we think in our heads, internally, and then go on to act “out there” in the world, through our bodies. “I think I should have my second cup of tea around about now. . . . But I should really finish editing this chapter first . . . but I can’t be bothered, and it can wait. I am going to indulge myself.” And so I rise from my chair, leave my office, go to the kitchen, and act; I make my cup of tea and sip it guiltily, in a classic instance of a thought-act sequence—except that every event here is an act, and several are not in a particularly ordered and rational sequence!

- Thinking is acting; being is acting; and thinking is also being, which is to say, a new, dynamic, active sort of existence. To think differently is to act differently and consequently to be different. So it follows that when we recognize that we possess the mind of Jesus, we recognize that we possess an entirely new type of existence. Our new beliefs are not some small zone mainly comprising thoughts and a few pieces of information that reside somewhere in a person’s brain that do not change what we actually are anywhere else, at least directly, but that we hope will eventually cause other things to happen by way of acts. Rather, they denote a comprehensive claim about what a person actually is and what he or she does, at which moment Paul’s astonishing statement toward the end of Romans is now intelligible: “Everything that is not ‘through believing’ is sin” (14:23b).7 Everything that does not proceed from the mind of Jesus within us by way of the Spirit—a mind that is, at least in large measure, an ongoing dynamic bundle of… ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=2908))

- duality (as against an outright dualism, a challenge we will face in an especially sharp form momentarily). In effect, we possess two minds at any given moment, along with a dragging and vulnerable body of Flesh. We are located in two different, fully overlapping, existences. But Paul is very clear that we should be living out of just the one, the mind of the Spirit—if necessary, beating our bodies of Flesh into submission (1 Cor 9:24–27). It is, as McSwain’s recent analysis makes clear, an asymmetrical duality. The relationship between iustus and peccator in the person is not equal or balanced. The presence of righteousness by way of Christ is vastly more important and dominant than the reality of the Flesh, hence the duality is profoundly asymmetrical. (Paul’s cognizance of this point is apparent in texts like Rom 5:15–17.) ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3005))

- Paul himself was facing at least a quasi-Gnostic challenge at Corinth as early as 52 CE. But what are Gnostics, and why are they a problem, and such a recurrent one? ([Location 3020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3020))
- Gnostics—to cut a long story short—view the resurrection as applying only to a part of the person, usually the soul or spirit. The rest of our present location, including our bodies, is viewed as contaminating garbage and so relegated to a zone of irrelevance, if not of direct pollution. So Gnostics believe in the goodness of just a tiny piece of a person. ([Location 3022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3022))
- Gnostics are all about escape from where we are in all its breadth, complexity, and tawdriness. They just want to downplay and ignore the Flesh in favor of our better side—a highly persuasive appeal! ([Location 3026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3026))
- The affinity between Gnosticism and Paul’s claim that we currently possess a resurrected mind is readily apparent. Gnostics, in a way, just strip down Paul’s gospel to this claim. They double down on the present reality of resurrection in our minds or spirits. We have it all now! ([Location 3028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3028))
- Since all that matters to these types of disciples—if they can be called that—is the resurrected spirit and the appropriate “knowledge” of this, a life of shameless dissipation can result. “Now we can just ignore all these temporary structures and categories playing out through our fleshly bodies that will be so decisively transcended on the last day.” Some of the Corinthians seem to have thought this way and plunged into a rampant enjoyment of eating, drinking, and radical sexual practices.16 “Wow. This Christian lifestyle is great. We get saved and we get to have a great time waiting for the end.” In fact they seem to have quoted the maxim “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,” which results in pretty flexible behavior when it is applied to certain other organs. They also seem to have employed the even more exciting slogan “Everything is legitimate!”17 ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3039))
- Both these views tend to translate into a stunning ethical indifference to the needs of others. Since they concern only “irrelevant” bodily activities, problems in relation to food, water, land, work, sex, illness, and even violence can be treated as matters of indifference. But what important ethical issue does not at some point involve a body?! There is no actual ethic operative in this system, and certainly not an ethic of ([Location 3046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3046))
- But we need to grasp clearly at the outset that this Gnosticizing application of eschatology—not uncommon, quelle horreur—is a straightforward non sequitur. It simply does not follow from the fact that aspects of our current existence are temporary and ultimately being transcended that they do not matter—a common inference, but a false one. Doctors and nurses still work hard to heal people, despite the knowledge that one day their patients will all die. Everything positive we do to people made of declining Flesh is temporary. But we still do it! Temporary things involving people still matter. And God is the same way. Temporary things still matter to him as well.19 And there are lots of good reasons for repudiating any allied Gnostic attempt to divide our present existence into a spiritual zone that matters and a material one that doesn’t. ([Location 3059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3059))
- There is therefore no area of life as we know it that lies outside of God’s concern and involvement. None. Everything must be subject to the God who made and rules and redeems everything; all must remain open to his commands.23 ([Location 3076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3076))
- This broad commitment to the here and now is confirmed by the deep involvement of Paul’s communities with practices that are bodily—things like appropriate sexual practices, shared food and clothing, healing, deliverance, and nonviolent peacemaking. ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3078))
- Complementing this insight into the importance of positive bodily practices is the sense of damage that negative activity inflicts on others. Whenever we fail to obey the promptings of the Spirit and turn, irrationally and foolishly, to our own sinful actions, we inflict pain on ourselves and on others. Evil is unleashed to this degree within the creative dimensions operating within our present locations, and disorder and pain ensue, which should all clearly be avoided. Damaging people is wrong; it is not simply irrelevant. ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3083))
- Jesus came in a body and was resurrected with a body. He expects us to act through our bodies in relation to other people as the church—and how else could we act?! ([Location 3091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3091))
- our current activity, in bodily ways, affects those around us, for good or for ill. (And it risks embracing a simple non sequitur; the temporary, despite being temporary, is still freighted with significance.) ([Location 3095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3095))
- Paul expected Jesus to return at any moment, when he expected to receive a wonderful new resurrection body made of spirit, which he describes in some detail in 1 Cor 15:35–50, as we noted earlier. And we probably should have roughly the same expectation as well. But in the event Jesus does not return before we die, another question comes up. What happens to us then? ([Location 3099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3099))
- There are two basic scenarios, but each of them leads to a problem. On the one hand, we could die and then cease to exist until our complete resurrection, soul and body, on the day of Jesus’s return. At that vital moment we would be entirely reconstituted. Now this would not presumably bother us. Paul euphemistically calls this “being asleep,” but that metaphor would be applied with reference to the complete lack of consciousness associated with death.25 In fact, we would “wake up” on the last day as if from a deep anesthetic, not remembering that a great deal of time might have passed—something of a Rip Van Winkle moment—because we would not actually have been in existence at all. But a potential problem is lurking here. ([Location 3106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3106))
- Clearly we would not have spent the intervening time with God, in the arms of Jesus. Moreover, death would thereby have intervened decisively into our relationship with God. And the resurrection mind would basically have died too. The break in relationship would not have proved permanent, but death would have been temporarily victorious. God’s desire to commune with us would have been thwarted for a time, and in Paul’s case for almost two thousand years so far. So God’s lordship would have been called into question, along with the efficacy of his resurrecting act in Jesus. If death can interrupt our relationship with God in this way, then there is something quite weak about it, along with the one who is establishing it, and the resurrection into the new age would be reversible, and Paul really doesn’t seem to think this is the case. ([Location 3112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3112))
- Perhaps we can get around this difficulty, however, simply by supposing, on the other hand, that we do go to be with God and to rest in the arms of Jesus after we die, but before we receive our new bodies on the last day. That final event—that consummation—will lie ahead of us, but we will wait for it safely tucked up in the folds of Jesus’s robes, perhaps in the way that the poor man Lazarus was being carried around after his death by Abraham (Luke… ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3119))
- Scholars sometimes refer to this temporary existence of our spirits with Jesus after death but before full bodily resurrection as “the intermediate state.”27 We live in this state until the last day when—with a blast—we receive our wonderful new bodies and become fully alive and operational again (out of bed and, presumably, running around fully awake, embracing the day). And this scenario does explain a number of Paul’s texts, especially his firm expectation that death will not separate him from God. If death arrives imminently, perhaps at the hands of… ([Location 3124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3124))
- If we go to be with Jesus after we die, living in a real, authentic relationship with him prior to the receipt of a new body, we must exist in some soulish state as a spirit and so rather like a ghost. Part of us floats off to be with Jesus while it waits for the other part to be added later on. But if we really live with Jesus after death in this soulish state, sleeping in the ancient sense of that happy activity, it seems that we don’t really need a body to be added later on at all. If we are already with him, sleeping and waking off and on in his arms, then this is the goal of the entire process. We are living with Jesus! And we have thereby opened the door again to Gnosticism. It seems we have conceded that only souls or spirits really matter.… ([Location 3130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3130))

We are, in effect, extinguished, any previous experience of the resurrection having been snuffed… ([Location 3138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3138))
- seems, then, that we are on the horns of a real dilemma here. If we can’t live with Jesus fully as a soul but need to wait for a new body, which we will receive on the last day, this leaves us with a broken relationship with God for a while. Both God’s lordship over death and the reality of his resurrecting act in Jesus are thereby impugned. If we can live and be with Jesus effectively as a soul or spirit immediately after we… ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3141))
- Paul himself seems to affirm the intermediate state, going on to affirm scenario 1 as well(!). When he dies, he will fall asleep in the arms of Jesus as a soul or spirit, but he will get a new body eventually. This view seems particularly clear in Philippians, as we have already briefly seen. He desires to depart and to be with Christ after death immediately in 1:21–26; but he also looks forward in 3:20–21 to the receipt of his glorious new body when Christ returns. He has a new soul or spirit in the meantime, and it is tightly intertwined with the divine Spirit. Indeed, it is his indwelling by this Spirit that makes him especially confident that he will, one day, be fully resurrected, in soul, mind, and… ([Location 3146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3146))

- The difficulty in this whole relation is being caused by a false conception of time. The problem of the intermediate state is arising because time is being treated as a fixed, linear constant. It is being treated like a “line” that both God and we travel along. (Alternatively, it travels slowly and steadily past us all, like a river.) Neither God nor we can shift around on this line beyond our regular fixed movement as a point along it. We cannot reach behind the point where we are into the past or jump forward into the future. Time is inexorable, and we are locked into the present, a… ([Location 3162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3162))
- The result of this view of time is that we will probably die at a point ahead of us on the line, whether near or far, while the last day must take place still further away, down at the end of the line. And a long gap now opens up, created by the piece of time that will need to elapse between these two events. This piece is the stretch of linear time that is yet to unfold between our death and the final day. It is this particular piece of the timeline that creates the tension or pressure that we are currently struggling with. It… ([Location 3167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3167))
- We might say, then, that an unavoidable piece of time on the timeline in between personal death and the end of the age is causing this problem. ([Location 3177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3177))
- Time is in fact not a constant or a line that moves along steadily; rather, it is a field just like our experience of space. And all the physical fields interact with one another relationally and dynamically. People exist in a space-time continuum. The one constant in the universe—so the only thing approaching a line in form or notion—was, Einstein proved, the speed of light. ([Location 3179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3179))
- This view of time as a field is hard to detect at our local level, where Newton’s equations, based on a false view of reality presupposing time as a constant, nevertheless predict movement (and much else) very well. At vast distances of interstellar dimensions, however, it quickly becomes apparent that Newton’s account is false and Einstein’s is correct. Time is a field that bends in the vicinity of large masses like stars. It interacts and shifts in relation to mass and other things, just as space does (hence the phenomenon of gravity as well). Consequently, space travelers experience time at different speeds from people… ([Location 3182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3182))

- We are still “presently” caught up in the field of time, experiencing it as a movement from past to present to future. In terms of our experience it feels like a line. But God is not part of this temporal experience. He is not governed by a timeline (and neither in fact are we; we are “moving” through a field). Consequently, he is not waiting for the cosmic clock to expire so that he can transform everyone who is still standing around at that point and resurrect everyone else finally at that point on the timeline. He is not subject to time and is certainly not affected by time as a constant. Time is something he created and governs. It gives us a structure within which we can exist, but it hardly structures God. There is a sense, then, in which we must think about God as being “above” the field of time.

- It follows from all this that the end of history, when God transforms and resurrects everyone at that moment on the timeline, in effect cutting it off and ending it, no longer makes much sense as some particular future day in relation to which the cosmic clock is ticking, and toward which the line of time is slowly moving. It is not a point at the end of a timeline, any more than the new heaven and earth is another space somewhere next to our present one. Any day is simply a particular plot on the space-time continuum, while the continuum itself has no obvious end.

- our problem here has been solved. This problem, because it presupposes a temporal linearity, now basically disappears. It seems that when people die, they leave our space-time continuum and go to live with God in the perfection of time, and consequently in a sense “above” our time.

    - **Tags:** #pink
- God is experiencing the perfection of the space-time continuum, which is where we are headed. Moreover, as we already know, this time-bending action by God is not really difficult, because he created it. So there are no gaps here, no partial actions on his part. Everything holds together. ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3230))
- I suggest, in short, that there will be no separation between death and a fully embodied resurrection in the presence of God, but the dead will enjoy that fullness in another place and another time, so to speak, as they are resurrected there. We who are left behind experience this situation differently. It feels future to us because we have not seen it take place, except in Jesus. But this is a deceptive intuition derived from our experience of time as a constant. On the other side of the coin—the arrival of the end of the age—we can now see that the last day and its resurrection will come all around us, in the past, the present, and the future, “when” it comes. The perfect time of God will overwhelm and transform the fallen time that we are living in. So, just as we can think of God’s arrival as happening all through existing space, we ought to think about it happening all through time as well. Both these fields will be transformed. To ask “when” this will happen is consequently to ask a meaningless question. ([Location 3232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=3232))

- But Paul is equally committed to the unbreakability of our present relationship with God, into which nothing can intervene—not death or life, the present or the future, and so on. So we cannot commit to an “interval” imposed on us by our deaths, as we wait for new bodies, which Paul is expecting to be provided on the last day. And in fact, in this famous text, Paul comes very close to giving us permission to think about how time cannot break our relationship with God.

- All our difficulties here are being caused, I would suggest, by a basic theological mistake. The conceptualizing that is being done at this moment, especially about the way God acts on us, is uncontrolled and projected. In other words, we have slipped once more into foundationalism. We are making things up for ourselves. We are analogizing about very deep dynamics in relation to God and reality in an undisciplined and ultimately inaccurate way, grabbing notions and metaphors from around us—from our history and culture and from a naive approach to reality—and supposing that they explain accurately both God and us, instead of letting God supply the key analogies through the prism of Christ. This is what is getting us into trouble, as it usually does. In fact, this is the way in which foundationalism can reenter Christian thinking and subvert it, infecting a particular issue or area within a broader, healthy body (i.e., a body of thinking that is basically oriented by Jesus) and spreading contamination outward from that point. To deal with this diseased theologizing, we must return to strictly christological analogizing and cut out the offending foundationalist tumor. Some theological surgery is necessary!

To be caused in an automatic, or even mechanical, way is not to be free to this extent. A lump of wood does not act freely. The more an automatic election, the less freedom, so any maximal commitment to election in this sense must erase human freedom, which then reduces much of the Bible’s advice and our own experience to nonsense (although the practical effect of this inference will often be the moral repudiation of any notion of election).

This deeply personal journey together is perhaps ultimately as irresistible as a potter’s shaping of a vessel (this being the question we wrestle with in ch. 18), but it is by no means reducible to that relationship.

This is the secret that lies at the heart of the universe. We have also learned that something has gone wrong. A great dislocation in this communion has taken place so that God’s unfolding creation has become pervasively contaminated with sin. Nevertheless, God has acted decisively—in person!—to deliver us from our deathly contamination and to set us back on the pathway to life. We have been resurrected, at least in our minds, a claim that is plausible when we avoid applying distorting Western categories to it. We have also learned how to avoid crippling our ongoing journey by misunderstanding the way God’s electing actions relate to ours.

- We can probably see immediately that effecting this communion will now break down into two closely related but distinguishable activities. We should deepen the communion of those who are already acknowledging and living explicitly out of it. And we should try to reach people who are currently turned away from God, drawing them back into the communion with God and with one another for which they have always been destined. God calls us into communion, he always has and always will, and so those who have broken this fellowship will be called, ceaselessly, back into it, while the broken people currently indwelling it will be tirelessly encouraged to further abandon their brokenness. Hence, at bottom, when we think about what God’s sweeping cosmic vision looks like concretely, on the ground, as we are actively involved with it now, we can see that God is in the business of nurturing and founding (further) communities.

- We need now to add a further important dimension to our developing understanding of learning and freedom. Freedom, in the positive, increasing, incremental sense of learning, requires structures to grow in relation to, and is in fact inconceivable without these underlying, preexisting forms. Our liberal culture—as we will see in more detail shortly—might be tempted to denote these structures as limiting our freedom. Anything that encroaches on or blocks our freedom is often thought to be a bad thing and emphatically not an aspect of freedom itself; it intrudes on our “space.” But this is to be deceived by the liberal account of freedom. Free behavior is acting, and acting always takes place in relation to something. By acting in relation to structures, many other acts are closed off—but so what? Structures allow further free acts that we couldn’t do before. They facilitate them. ([Location 4115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4115))

But if I sit in a room for long enough and learn sufficient ancient Greek, then I can read books written in ancient Greek, including a number of letters by Paul. Moreover, I need the preexisting structure that is a pedagogical tradition concerning ancient Greek so that I can begin to learn Greek within it. I need a textbook and teachers and now can even utilize the occasional YouTube clip. I need an entire structure that orchestrates and conveys a complex arrangement of information and knowledge in such a way that I can respond and gradually learn it, and this structure is considerable.

- One way of speaking of these all-important preexisting structures is in terms of “traditions.” This word can sound a little negative to some, but it is really nothing more than the recognition that human beings cannot act without these vast, complex, preexisting patterns and arrangements.

And although it resonates with our experiences as people in some respects, if it is embraced in its totality, it generates all sorts of theological problems.6 So if we are to move forward constructively, we must undertake some further disciplined reflections on the nature of true freedom, and we must learn to recognize and to repudiate its cultural counterfeit, here as offered by liberalism.

- However, rather than holding on to the insight that relationships should be intrinsically free and loving—or at least respectful—and not characterized by bullying and coercion, liberals tend to think about “freedom from” as a space that individuals need to be able to live in, where they can operate unconstrained by anything. To be free in the sense of liberated is to be free from any relationships at all, a position that arguably resolves definitively the problem of tyrannical intrusion by a government or by any other entity. However, several other intellectual notions underpin this ultimately rather curious notion, allied with a final, more self-serving claim.

- That is, liberalism tends to assume a cosmos within which causal factors are automatic and so necessarily limit freedom as choice. Any causality acting on us must in that very influence constrain us. Causality is always automatic, and frequently mechanical. Hence to be caused in any way is not to be free to that extent. It follows from this line of thought that our freedom is the part of our reality that is set apart from causality and protected from it (although this need to divide reality into two fundamentally different worlds has caused liberal intellectuals a lot of problems). Freedom must exist, for those thinking in these terms, in some sort of uncaused space of its own.

And this all results in an approach to acting that is oriented very strongly by our “wills.” Wills are a strange notion, but we have to infer their existence if we are thinking in this way.

Anything else would be tyranny! “You can’t tell me what I want or don’t want.” And this conception has led to a long and very unhealthy intellectual trend in Western thinking called voluntarism.

- But if the liberal account of negative freedom, or freedom from, is problematic, its account of positive freedom, or freedom to, doubles down on the damage. Few suggestions are more destructive than the notion that true human freedom consists of choosing between options, largely on the basis of a “will,” and in a way that is necessarily unconstrained by outside influences. In the first instance, this pulls freedom out of its appropriate location, in concrete, particular, personal relationships, where it operates within those relationships, usually either initiating or responding. Healthy freedom, understood in these relational terms, has a unidirectional quality. It chooses to initiate or to respond but it does not choose between equal options.

- marriage or friendship intertwined with a liberal account of freedom might unfold very differently, however. Perhaps influenced by the belief that freedom is a space around the individual free from influence from anything or anyone else, a spouse might feel that marriage is a restriction on freedom. This might even have been symbolized by the groom’s wearing of a ball and chain at his bachelor’s party the night before the ceremony—prison awaits!11 And this attitude make sense. After marriage, choice is clearly delimited. A married man cannot simply will or do what he wants to, and he cannot just choose what he wants to any more, so marriage is a sacrifice of liberal freedom. But perhaps if another tempting opportunity comes along, in the name of freedom, a participant might decide to leave the marriage, to dissolve it, and to move on to another relationship. Such marriage dissolution would be a blow on behalf of freedom! Or someone might simply decide to move on, as Lynyrd Skynyrd’s immortal signature song, “Free Bird,” puts it: If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now Cause there’s too many places I’ve got to see.

- We know well by now that love is not coerced or coercive—with the exception of extreme circumstances where protective restraint is required—and that it is profoundly free. Love that is not freely given and freely received would not be love. But if the basis of a relationship is shifted to choice, it is necessarily shifted away from love, and undermines it. We do not choose those whom we love. We love them! And this means that there is a great compulsion about our relationship! It is not physically and abusively coercive, but it is a powerful thing—a tide of emotional and psychological longing and affection and curiosity and passion. We commonly say that we fall in love. In the first great high of love, the thought of enduring a long separation from the one we love feels like the pangs of death! My relationship with my wife, Rachel, began freely. But it was not a choice between different options. I did not walk into church one day and look around and say, “I think I’ll choose Rachel today to be my wife, although I could equally well choose Mary or Joan or Cynthia. In fact, I might just choose Sybil. Or I might not. So many options, so little time.”… ([Location 4312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4312))

And this is where our true freedom resides, in this relationship, where it stays freely, and where it can grow as we learn to love God more and more.

- But with these realizations, the theological damage introduced by a liberal account of positive freedom has not yet ended. An emphasis on freedom as a choice between different options, unconstrained by outside influences, also destroys any traditioned process of formation (which is why we are discussing it here). This account of freedom is hostile to traditions, and hence to learning, since all learning presupposes tradition. Such traditions, with their accumulations of learning and knowledge and wisdom, and their influences from teachers and from other guardians of the tradition who know more than the learner, along with their relational patterns of attentiveness and subordination, tend to be viewed as unacceptable impositions on the freedom of the individual, who finds the deepest roots of choice within himself or herself! Learning, it is said, should begin with the learner, not with those who know more and who are deeper within the tradition. People should guide their own learning. To be free and to make the right choice ultimately entails only that a person “know thyself” (and presumably this is why so much of modernity… ([Location 4329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4329))

- Inveterate consumers might begin to think that preference precedes truth and might be encouraged in this perversion by market-oriented news outlets and social media. Classical liberals would be horrified by the current profession of many citizens of modern democracies that the truth is chosen, and that they will choose as they see fit. They would implore such dilettantes to employ their reason and their integrity to seek hard after what is actually true—to address things like evidence and valid argumentation. But their system has no strong reasons for enjoining these virtues upon modern liberals (virtues that classical liberals may have taken for granted from their Christian tradition), and liberal rationalism is no match for the powerful narratives and emoting of modern consumer society—for that tradition.

- They therefore insist on a “space” or “zone” of freedom around the individual that is free from any influence. The uncaused and free space of individuals is anchored by their minds and their rationality. It includes their property, which is private. Positive freedom is exercised in this space.

- Negative freedom denies the need and legitimacy of relationships, thereby denying the very thing that gifts personhood and learning, which results in a growth in positive freedom. Recognizing the ubiquity of relationships, it allows people to engage relationally on the basis of the individual’s consent.

We must therefore trenchantly reject and resist a false liberal account of freedom, whether in terms of freedom from any causal influence from outside of the individual, especially traditioned or relational influence, or in terms of freedom to do things anchored in a faculty of will that merely decides to act on the basis of internal preferences, choosing one option over another.

- A lot of scholars have been awakened to the importance of Christian formation and virtue by the work of Alasdair MacIntyre. This was the case for me to a certain extent.

In this chapter, however, I have undertaken a completely different theological justification for formation from MacIntyre, and my subsequent account will continue to differ from his in key respects. MacIntyre is a foundationalist, a position I clearly want to avoid. I have also avoided using Aristotelean categories in a seminal role. Neither MacIntyre nor Aristotle develops an eschatological virtue ethic! Having said this, there is always much to learn from MacIntyre’s stunningly learned mind (and from Aristotle’s).

- As sociologists have long known, elitism names the construction of every human community we are a part of. All groups have leaders and followers. Every human group is hierarchical in some way, whether we are speaking of families, classrooms, playgrounds, factories, faculties, churches, governments, or tribes. Hence, although intellectual resistance to this notion is widespread, one wonders whether this is not rather like standing on the beach and defying the tide to come in. Elitism is ubiquitous, which is also to say in the same breath, that leaders and leadership are ubiquitous. The really useful questions we need to ask at this moment are not whether elitism exists or what the way to eliminate it is as much as what specific mode of instruction leaders should employ and students should submit to, what sort of leaders we should have, and how we should relate to them. Just because we know we should have teachers and should learn something doesn’t tell us how they should teach and how we best learn.

These responses then radiate through their relational networks to four degrees of separation and beyond. Our relationships change us to a degree we find it hard to imagine, although the data are quite clear. ([Location 4604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4604))

- We know now that people learn from one another as they receive, imprint, and respond to simulacra—that is, reproductions—of the mental and affective states of other people with whom they are relating and, in a sense, resonating with. ([Location 4689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4689))
- We can understand now, moreover, how Paul can speak of oneness, or unity, in fundamentally relational terms that seem to stretch to include multiple people, who do not lose their distinctiveness but are also a unity in some powerful sense. God is one, but is God the Father; and the Lord is one, but is the Lord Jesus. Both are also one God in their inseparable relationship with one another and sharing in one another.12 Similarly, a man who has left his father and mother and cleaved to his wife in marital and sexual union is one with her. They are profoundly intertwined relationally, as one, with many simulacra, putting things prosaically, from the one existing in the other, and yet they are distinct. And in just the same way, Paul envisages his teaching taking place imitatively through coworkers. Jesus is in Paul, and Paul is in Timothy, along with Jesus (the latter indwelling being rather more important). So the Corinthians can experience Jesus through Timothy and should imitate him. In just the same sense, Paul always works in groups, in a relational team. He is never alone. Jesus is mediated within the team to one another, and through them to others. This inherently relational interplay also explains Paul’s application of a body metaphor to his communities in an analogy we will develop in more detail later on. People in Paul’s day thought of bodies in highly relational ways, as porous and interconnected entities, so this metaphor deepens his investment in a unified relationality.

- At the heart of relating is—once our incapacity has been healed—a learning process, a process that also leads to our growth in freedom. ([Location 4729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=4729))
- We all “frame” people essentially by telling a particular story about them. Christians do this framing of outsiders all the time; a definition of the non-Christian is built into Christian identity. So we all have a characteristic story we tell about non-Christians—about what they are really like, deep down, how they are not like us, and what they should do about it.1 ([Location 8058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8058))
- What is our body language transmitting to people we view as outsiders as we walk among them and speak with them? Do they detect a fundamental posture of judgment, in which case we are positioning ourselves as morally superior to them? Are we in effect speaking down to them from a height somewhere above them? And are we asking them—perhaps before we open our mouths—to change and to be more like us as a condition of our continued relationship? Are we saying, “You and I are fundamentally different, and I’m basically a little superior to you, so you need to become like me”? Or are we sending a more constructive and affirming message about their personhood and value, irrespective of their visible differences from us? ([Location 8065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8065))
- We have three options available when we start to think about those who lie outside the key group we identify with, and who we think are not like us in various supposedly important respects. We can frame these outsiders negatively as we proceed to think in foundational terms, forward; as we will see momentarily, this is the most dangerous procedure. Or we can proceed retrospectively, and so free ourselves from the foundationalist trap, but still frame outsiders fundamentally negatively. This is not as dangerous as the first option, but it is still potentially destructive. Or we can frame outsiders retrospectively and fundamentally positively. This is clearly rather more constructive. However, it leaves certain key questions dangling that we must still be able to answer, among other things, why people should become Christians, and what now distinguishes Christians from non-Christians. ([Location 8082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8082))
- As we saw already at the inception of this book, in part 1, a foundationalist makes truth claims about God and God’s ways by appealing to some ultimate truth other than Jesus Christ—and often with the best of intentions. ([Location 8091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8091))
- We already know that the endorsement of theological foundationalism by way of this simple evangelistic schema is very unwise, not to mention, disobedient; the central, sovereign truth that is God revealed in Jesus has been subtly but permanently undermined by its forward-oriented argument. ([Location 8117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8117))
- That is, if one transgression, by Adam, can have the effectively nuclear impact of death for all of humankind, how much more powerful must the one act of Jesus be, which follows an entire humanity of transgressors, each one of which has committed a potentially nuclear sin, and yet solves everything. ([Location 8165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8165))
- labor this point a little because Paul’s interpreters can lose sight of it so easily, and yet it is so important. Jesus is bigger and better than Adam, so Jesus’s work encompasses Adam, which is to say that he encompasses and defines humanity. We are all who and what we are in relation to Jesus and as defined by him. And this includes “outsiders.” Indeed, there are now no real outsiders. We are all inside Jesus, even those who do not know it. The truth of each person is the truth that he or she is informed by Jesus deeply and significantly. This relation is what makes people good and right and true, insofar as they are these things. Jesus is at work in them because Jesus comprehends and is at work in the world as its creator, as well as its redeemer. ([Location 8170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8170))
- We should recall our musical analogy here again. We are all in Jesus, which is our determinative reality. But as we already know well, we are also all in Adam. The discordant music of the Flesh is playing simultaneously in us alongside the music of heaven. We live in these two dimensions at the same time. But we must affirm that our determinative reality is God, which is to say, Jesus. If we deny this relation, then we lapse into a functional Marcionism, as T. F. Torrance once observed so insightfully.4Any denial of the full determination of us all by Jesus commits us to the existence of some part of creation—and this instance a very important part, namely, all those people who are not in the church—in a state of separation from Jesus, which is really just theological nonsense. Where God the creator is present, whom we often think of as the father, God the savior, Jesus, is present as well; it is the same God. Marcion separated creation from salvation, and he separated two Gods here as well—as he had to—and the church rightly repudiated these mistaken assertions. So we must continue to repudiate this separation, following Paul’s lead in the texts we have just noted. We must not fail to affirm that God’s actions on us in Jesus are superior to the evil erosion of our goodness that the Adamic story speaks of. Who is more powerful, more important, more determinative: God or the devil? ([Location 8176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8176))
- As we saw a moment ago, we can—and must!—now define the non-Christian positively, in relation to Jesus. There is no inside and outside here anymore. There are no more “outsiders.” (Rejecters, maybe, but outsiders, no.) Furthermore, if Christ is present with and at work in non-Christians, then we are free to recognize and to affirm this. And Jesus is at work in non-Christians, often to our shame. ([Location 8188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8188))
- Jesus is present there. So we ought to treat everyone as Jesus. When we serve anyone, we serve Jesus. When we meet anyone, we meet Jesus. However, even as we recognize Jesus in others, we must also recognize the Adamic dimension that is present in all of us as well. So while we might be open to the work of Jesus in non-Christians, we should not be surprised to see the powers of evil at work there as well. Of course we should be equally unsurprised to see the powers at work in us. We are all in Adam. So we actually possess a double solidarity with the non-Christian: the solidarity of a fundamental if subtle determination by Jesus, and a shared collaboration and solidarity with the forces of evil and sin. We are in solidarity both in Jesus and in Adam. Hence our fundamental relationship with the non-Christian is one of solidarity, and not of otherness at all. Paul’s Initial Proclamation We need to let these insights restructure how we think about Paul’s presentation of the gospel.

- In all this, Paul is revealing a heavenly secret, he says, which ancient Greeks called a mystery. This heavenly secret has been present since the foundation of the world and is bound up with God’s Wisdom, but it has now been revealed to Paul, who reveals it in turn to those who will listen to this bedraggled messenger. It is, in some sense and despite appearances, a message of power. Jesus, the crucified one, is the Wisdom of God, and those “in him” receive “deliverance and cleansing and release” (1 Cor 1:30). Moreover, this God is interested in everyone. ([Location 8223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8223))
- Those possessing status, learning, and pedigree, as well as those possessing significant reservoirs of prior religious knowledge, tend to deride this message. But God has sent his Son to experience the shameful death of crucifixion—the death of a low-class felon. And in doing this, Paul says, God has shown that he is deeply committed to those the world regards as unimportant. He reaches down into the very depths of our existence and into the most distant and shameful corners of our society to touch and to gather back the people living there. So Paul’s Corinthian converts are primarily an unimportant group, ill-born, despised, and possessing little or nothing. This stooping, affirming, including event is the message of the crucified Lord. And it links hands directly with parts of Paul’s message that are already well established for us. ([Location 8227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8227))

- It can hardly be overemphasized that this is Paul’s first word in his preaching. There is no preamble because there can be no preamble to the revelation of a divine secret. This can only be declared by an appointed ambassador like Paul.5 The declaration focuses on a divine Father who sends his only Son to die a shameful death for you, whoever you are. Your baptism declares how you have entered his death and thereby entered his new life. And if all this seems a little hard to credit, the signs and wonders of the Spirit affirm that this new life is present, albeit in some oddly invisible way. The strangely vulnerable figure before us is speaking the truth about God, a God who loves you enough to send his Son to gather you back and his Spirit to heal you. So we can see now that Paul’s preaching—at least insofar as he tells us what it is—is fundamentally inclusive. It does not “… ([Location 8239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8239))

- So the church is—at least in theory—living overtly and vigorously within its relationship with God. It is self-consciously walking in obedience and thereby in joy and peace, and it is teaching its members to resist the allure of evil, aware that any lapses lead to pain and destruction. This is not to claim that the church’s correspondence with the ways of God is perfect or that the world’s lack of correspondence is total. But it is to affirm that a wholehearted commitment to God is the pathway to life, and any rejection of this commitment is to stray onto the pathway to death. And herein lies the basic distinction between the church and the world.

But she is lonely and wants to find the perfect man to marry so that she can enjoy the riches of that relationship. Somewhat strangely, however, she is in fact married, to a lovely man, who sleeps next to her at night in her bed, gets up and makes a glorious breakfast in the morning, with French toast and fruit garnishes and a steaming cup of coffee, and talks to her happily when she gets home in the evening from work. (It is a somewhat old-fashioned relationship.) But she does not believe he is there and steadfastly refuses to acknowledge his presence. As far as she is concerned, she sleeps alone, she has to make her own breakfast—a hurried mix of bland instant porridge—and her days pass silently.

- In addition, this approach—this frame—encourages us to think about the church as a bounded entity. It is separated from the outside world by some sort of wall, which we must now spend a lot of time defining. And its relationship with non-Christians is now significantly differentiated. There is a qualitative difference between those on the inside and those on the outside. Non-Christians are being “othered” as something different and inferior (and the Jews are often the quintessential other). And missionary work is now a foray by morally superior people out into hostile and debased territory. It is a dangerous sortie. Furthermore, if the missionaries are using a foundationalist account of the situation, narrating the journey of the non-Christian from the outside in, so to speak (i.e., beginning with the broad situation of the outsider, under judgment, then trying to supply them with good reasons for becoming a Christian), the negation of the outsider will be written permanently into the constitution of the Christian church, along with a foundationalist approach to theology as a whole.

- Paul was no Marcionite. His vision of reality is Christocentric. And the church is consequently not set off qualitatively from the rest of humanity. It is in solidarity with humanity, both in Jesus and in Adam. However, it is set off by its obedience. When messianic Jews and Christians live in obedience to Jesus—when they follow him—they fulfill a priestly role, attesting to the world around them what the ways of God are really like. So there is no need to spend time articulating and specifying—and perhaps even erecting—a barrier between the church and non-Christians. There is a comprehensive difference operating here all the time as those in the church obey God, bearing in mind that non-Christians obey too for some of the time, even as many in the church do not. Nevertheless, the church is that specific part of the broader circle of humanity that enjoys the presence of God and walks self-consciously on the pathways of life. It is the primary place where the peace and joy flowing from that relationship can be found. ([Location 8321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8321))

- I trust, then, that it is clear that it is entirely possible to frame non-Christians in fundamentally positive terms, not to mention in full solidarity with the church, in relation both to Adam and to Christ, and yet to supply an entirely convincing account of the difference between the two groups in terms of a difference of ethics or obedience and its attendant consequences.

- There is an important difference between (1) wanting to be resurrected and then be judged worthy of life in the age to come and (2) wanting simply to be one of the resurrected who thereby is part of the life of the age to come. The resurrection is doing different things in these two stories. And although Paul is often read in terms of the former scenario, where all are resurrected bodily, judged retributively, and then the virtuous are rewarded with eternal life, a careful consideration of his letters suggests that he was an advocate of the latter scenario, where only the righteous are resurrected. And this understanding will change some things. ([Location 8449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8449))

- That is, everyone who is resurrected is confessing the lordship of Christ and therefore is presumably both righteous (in him) and saved.8 The only way to make sense of these two positions consistently—exclusion of some people right beside the universal confession of Jesus’s lordship by the resurrected—is through a limited resurrection of the righteous only, but this expectation does explain things neatly.9 Only some people are resurrected and saved, and all the resurrected are consequently obedient followers of God. They all bend the knee to him and confess him as Lord. The disobedient simply do not get resurrected, which is why pagan converts in Corinth were being baptized vicariously on behalf of dead family members (1 Cor 15:29). They wanted them to be resurrected as well. So sinners are indeed excluded from the future kingdom. ([Location 8468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8468))

- When Jesus was resurrected, he in effect coded bodily resurrection with an indelibly positive function. That event and process were taken up into him. Moreover, he did not get resurrected and then face judgment. Jesus’s resurrection is, for Paul, a saving event in its own right. It is the reconstitution of humanity beyond the contamination of Sin and the grip of Death. The resurrection is, then, by its very nature, saving, although it is also rather more than this. It is liberating, life-giving, and glorious. In view of this, it is extremely difficult to make sense of a future scenario within which some are resurrected bodily, only to be judged unworthy and sentenced to death and possibly also to hell. Gifted momentarily with bodies free of sin, contamination, and death, and temporarily glorious, thanks to the work of Jesus—raised in him, bearing his image—these people are nevertheless herded after their sentencing onto the heavenly equivalent of cattle cars and sent away to be exterminated. If the resurrection is to function as a salvific act in and of itself—and Paul’s ethic depends on it—then this scenario doesn’t make much sense.

- understanding of judgment sufficiently transformed by the great process of judgment that stands at the heart of the cosmos—and that stands at the heart of all healthy parenting as well. The judgment that Paul has in view in all these texts is, I would suggest, an evaluative and not a punitive judgment.14 Once our eyes have been opened and our ears attuned to this alternative type of judgment to the strictly retributive, we can see that this is what Paul has in mind in his judgment texts that discuss a future evaluation, and consequently only of the saved before God’s throne. We learn from these texts, that is, that the righteous who are resurrected will still face some sort of scrutiny. They will be held accountable. (We will be held accountable.)

I am a parent, and a child, so I know this statement to be true. We are constantly being evaluated in relation to our behavior by our parents, and we constantly evaluate our children in the second type of evaluative judgment process just described.

Parenting helps children to grow in wisdom, drawing the connection between a bad decision and its resulting set of painful consequences that is obvious to us but far from obvious to our children in their youth and stupidity. “I shouldn’t do this anymore.

The prospect of this scenario should motivate his followers powerfully. They want this job evaluation to go especially well. It is the big one. They want Jesus to be pleased, not disappointed.

- We have just seen that all Jesus’s followers will be resurrected bodily and judged in the sense of being parentally evaluated. Everyone who is so resurrected and judged will be a community member, hence a messianic Jew or a Christian, and no one else will enjoy this second life. Paul is confident, that is, that God will destroy all remaining evil and evildoers on the last day, leaving dead evildoers unresurrected, and this position is especially apparent in his earliest letters, which were written to the Thessalonians.

They will all meet again, the creeds phrasing this gathering as “the communion of saints.” But note that no universal resurrection and ensuing punitive judgment are mentioned here, and it is difficult to see where these could be inserted into the story without disrupting it.15 Community members left alive are transformed “in the blink of an eye” and caught up to be with Jesus, as 1 Corinthians explains ([Location 8575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8575))

Most important for our present concern, to be resurrected here is simply to be glorified (so Phil 3:21; Col 3:4).

- There can be little doubt, then, that Paul saw the future playing out very differently in relation to two contrasting groups of people. The chosen will be saved. They are marked now by the Holy Spirit and are supposed to live spotless lives. On the last day if they have died, they will be fully resurrected and glorified, along with the suffering cosmos, or if they are still alive, they will be transformed in the blink of an eye. They will all then be presented blameless before God, where they will give an account of their work—a moment that could be exquisitely embarrassing but that will not result in ultimate exclusion. Shockingly, Paul made the offer of salvation indiscriminately to pagans, and in a double shock, his definition of righteous living did not include many standard Jewish activities (something we will discuss shortly in more detail in part 4). So there will be some surprises in this happy throng and their divine evaluation. ([Location 8599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=8599))

In the first instance we need to grasp that it is entirely possible for people to push an arrangement away, however destructive and irrational that rejection might be, but this refusal does not mean that the overarching arrangement is a contract, as any parent of troubled teenagers knows.

Her rejection of this reality and its ongoing gracious invitation does not mean that she can do anything to reestablish the relationship itself and thereby turn this covenant into a contract. The covenant is still in place. It is there. It is always there. She is just rejecting and abusing it. She should respond to this covenant as is appropriate; in doing so, she would stop damaging herself, as well as the other people who love her and are engaged with her.

- Barth of Church Dogmatics III/2 says, God is then under no obligation to save such people in the future in spite of themselves. He is free to endorse their rejection, to leave them in their vain imaginings, and to continue into eternity with the grateful saved alone. Those who are saved in the meantime ought to pray and to hope for the salvation of all; this is the loving thing to do. We are to love our enemies, or at least to try to. And loving them presumably includes both hoping the best for them—that they will be saved—and praying accordingly. But we are not in a position either to tell God what to do or to affirm confidently that universal salvation will in fact happen. That is up to God. And this eschatological agnosticism does not entail that God is contractual. It is just that the covenantal God will not override the stupidity of sinful people, and it may even arguably be the covenantal thing not to do so.19 So Paul’s harsh exclusionary texts in relation to the future do not undermine his central claims about God’s love, depressing though this ultimate prospect might seem.

- All Paul’s befriending and converting is not merely an appropriately sensitive process, treating the other at bottom with dignity as a person whom Christ loves and sometimes even speaks to us through. It is a radically inclusive process, in Paul’s case involving outreach to the despised and hated pagans. His friendships are strange friendships, resulting in a radical and unavoidable diversity in his communities. Christians, after all, are not messianic Jews, and Christians themselves differ a great deal from one another. Lydia dyes cloth and sings and dances with former slaves and other stinking undesirables in Philippi, while Sergius Paulus reclines in his dining room with members of Rome’s political and cultural elite. And diversity of this magnitude causes trouble. It caused tremendous conflict in Paul’s day, and in different forms, it still does in ours. So we must try now to give an appropriate account of this signature feature of Paul’s missionary work and of a Pauline church network, which is the subject of part 4.

- Missionaries must frame non-Christians as people with whom Jesus is already involved. Moreover, to this end, they must incarnate as best they can into their contexts, walking alongside the people there, eschewing the use of power and resources to effect relationships and conversions, which would be manipulative. They must become like those they want to convert. “Brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you,” Paul says insightfully in Gal 4:12. And he makes the same point more programmatically—and rather famously—in 1 Cor 9:19–22 (which is a chiasm). ([Location 9750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=9750))
- Paul now thinks, and also constantly instructs his converts, on this basis, which is to say, in terms of what we can call a “resurrection ethic.” Our capacity to act in a good way comes from the fact—the fact!—that we have been reconstituted mentally within the new age, that is, the age to come, from the future (Col 3:1).

To be “justified” at this moment is to be “judged just” or “judged righteous” by God. ([Location 13207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13207))

- This is where Jesus comes in. His death on the cross (which isn’t mentioned in Gal 2:15–16 but comes into view, at least in some sense, in v. 20) is a payment for the punishment of everyone, at least potentially. His death “satisfies” God’s just anger with sin, which demands some sort of equivalent recompense.6 This event consequently balances out the scales of justice, or in a slightly different picture, it pays for the debt that has been accumulated when sinners have injured others. So Jesus’s death, understood in these terms, is very important. He steps into the place of punishment and bears that burden for us, vicariously (this being an act of divine generosity rather than justice). But we have to grasp on to this solution that God is offering us or it isn’t applied to us, and we do so by believing in it. We are saved by faith. We should place our entire hope in Jesus and trust that he will pay off the punishment accumulating in store for us. In addition, his perfect life will be “credited” to us so that when we stand before God on the day of judgment God will pronounce a verdict over us as if we are Jesus, and not as we actually are ourselves. It will be as if we are clothed with Jesus, and so we will receive the verdict “You are indeed perfectly righteous; enter into your owner’s joy in heaven.” ([Location 13223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13223))

- This whole sequence of learning about our own sinfulness by striving to obey the law, getting appropriately anxious and fearful, then hearing the good news that Jesus has paid for our sins on our behalf should end up with us enthusiastically and gratefully grasping the offer of salvation by faith. Consequently, the entire process is the gospel according to many scholars who read Paul in this fashion, with the preaching of the gospel necessarily prefaced by the proclamation of the law. The basic underlying sequence, then, is “law first, then gospel,” and clearly this progression works forward and can only work forward. It is our experience of the law that drives us to the gospel.

And this story clearly needs both of them to work and in this exact order. The first box is the foundation for the story. The story starts here, with the non-Christian, and if this box is taken away or its terms are significantly altered, the whole story falls apart. Salvation loses its rationale. There would be no reason to become a Christian and no explanation of how to do so or of what exactly God accomplishes in Jesus to make salvation happen. In addition, however, and as we have already seen, this box is Jewish. So Jews must represent the generic non-Christian.

Jews are basically supposed to realize that Judaism sucks, and self-evidently so! It is supposed to collapse because it is, in and of itself, unworkable. No one can get saved by doing works of law perfectly, which is to say that Judaism saves no one. And so those Jews who grasp this “truth” become Christians saved by faith alone and leave Judaism behind. It is the moral and rational thing to become a Christian, then, and the immoral and irrational thing to remain Jewish. As a result, the heart of Jewish identity is the realization that Jewish identity is inadequate and should be abandoned! It is a negative identity—an identity that rejects itself, and if it does not do so, it should be condemned.

- they are Jews characterized above all, according to this reading, by the attempt to gain salvation by doing works of law. It is as if salvation is a brownie point system. Each good deed earns points, and when Jews show up before God on judgment day, they expect the verdict “Well done, my good and faithful servant; you have earned enough brownie points to get into heaven; enter into your master’s joy.” This approach is often called legalism, and its advocates legalists (although we will recharacterize things more accurately in a moment). And there is a very basic problem here: Jews in Paul’s day were just not like this. ([Location 13302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13302))

- When we read what Jews themselves wrote in Paul’s day about God, as Sanders did, we find a very dedicated group of teachers who followed the instructions of Moses scrupulously because God had given these teachings to them to guide their lives. When God gives instructions, handing them down personally to one of your great leaders in an extraordinary event on a mountaintop, you take very careful consideration of what they say. So, just as many Christians are dedicated to studying and obeying the Bible today, Jews were (and are) dedicated to studying and to obeying the Torah. Most Christians don’t obey the Bible because by obeying it they hope to accumulate brownie points and thereby to get to heaven. They obey it because it contains critical instructions for living life. It is Scripture. It lies at the heart of pious living and obedience—of ethics. Christians know that they can’t do everything instructed by the Bible. But we still read it and study it and try to do what it says (suitably interpreted). Just so, most Jews obey the Torah for ethical reasons, not for self-interested reasons of salvation. Torah is a gift from God that shapes the Jewish way of life. Putting things a little more technically here, we could say that a careful analysis of the Jewish sources reveals a critical inaccuracy in this reading; the dogmatic location of Torah for most Jews is within ethics, not within soteriology.

- Complementing this insight is the belated realization that Jews are saved by election, which is to say, by God. God chose the Jews’ ancestors a long time ago and promised to save both them and their descendants. He called the Jewish people into existence by summoning and blessing Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah and Rachel. The resulting people, whom we know now as the Jews, are consequently his chosen people. God loves them and has a wonderful plan for their lives, which includes saving them. What sort of God would dump a people he called into being, having stayed in relationship with them through all sorts of ups and downs? It would be like deserting a beloved marriage partner on his or her deathbed! ([Location 13322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13322))
- By no means. Like any good parent, God knows his people sin and has made a lot of arrangements to deal with it. Moreover, like any good parent again, God does not cut off his people—his children—because they step out of line. His relationship with them is not dependent on a mere contract. He is Israel’s parent, and so he stays committed to the Jews in spite of and through any wrongdoing. And Jews in Paul’s day could be equally mature. They were often quite realistic about their transgressions. ([Location 13328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13328))
- God had made careful arrangements to deal with all this sin, and Jews were deeply dedicated to continuing those arrangements. They supported and in some cases ran a highly expensive and complex temple system that, among other things, atoned for sins. It did this every day and local Jews defended its purity to the death. Even if they lived thousands of miles away, Jews would send large sums of money for its upkeep annually and would travel and visit it in pilgrimage as often as they could. That is, most of the Torah is taken up with instructions for building and running the tabernacle, instructions that were taken to apply in turn to the temple in Jerusalem. And the temple, among other things, atoned for sins (see esp. Lev 16–17). So everyone Jewish knew that sin existed and that it was a problem that had to be dealt with, but they faithfully continued one of God’s solutions to this problem located in the temple.

- So the exquisitely penitent Prayer of Manasseh says, You, Lord, according to your gentle grace, promised forgiveness to those who are sorry for their sins. In your great mercy, you allowed sinners to turn from their sins and find salvation. Therefore, Lord, God of those who do what is right, you didn’t offer Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who didn’t sin against you, a chance to change their hearts and lives. But you offer me, the sinner, the chance to change my heart and life, because my sins outnumbered the grains of sand by the sea.

- “Jews think that they can be justified by works of Torah; they work away and expect God to pronounce them righteous on the day of judgment, in which they will fail because God will condemn them for not being perfect,” they opine.

- soteriological terms—as the definitive story of Christian salvation—is now in deep trouble. The challenging Jewish arrangement in Box A is the foundation for his whole position. It sets the entire account of salvation in motion by placing pressure on its occupants to learn that they are sinful and thereby need to move on to become Christians, and it just seems untrue. It is in fact an absurd and rather nasty generalization that cannot stand up to close scrutiny. Jews were not legalists, or at least many of them weren’t. However, without this claim holding good, in its entirety, for all Jews and then everyone else besides, Paul’s account of Christian salvation in terms of faith alone has no rationale. We are supposed to get saved by faith alone, which is nice and easy,13 because we fail so badly at attempted justification through works, as Jews do. Faith is manageable for us, we learn. And we want to get saved because God is going to punish us harshly if we don’t grasp onto Jesus by faith. But the first stage in this argument now seems to be false. Jews aren’t like this, and neither is God. God doesn’t expect us to observe the law perfectly, as any reasonable Jew will tell us. So there is now no reason to progress out of the first box into the second. In fact, there is no need to enter into Box A in the first place. Its account of Judaism is too extreme and unreasonable.

The men did not have to be circumcised, and the communities did not have to observe the Jewish calendar, to eat Jewish food, and so on. This teaching caused a lot of controversy.

- It cannot explain, that is, the signature feature of Paul’s mission, because when we read the argument about justification very carefully, we notice that the Torah is not abolished in relation to Christian behavior. It is abolished only salvifically, or as the texts say, in terms of justification. Christians are not justified and saved by observing the law. Fair enough (although who ever really thought they were, apart from a few foolish Jewish proto-Pelagians?!). But Christians should still be living in terms of the law’s instructions (which is what reasonable Jews did). Its ethical relevance is undisturbed!

- When the Torah says, “Do not covet,” it is true that no one can fully observe this commandment. We won’t be saved by fulfilling this demand perfectly if that is the way we get saved. But just because we won’t be saved this way, it does not follow that we don’t have to worry about covetousness any more. The ethical challenge named here remains. It is still the right thing not to covet, as the Torah says. Just because we can’t do it perfectly doesn’t mean it no longer applies. We should continue to work on our covetousness as hard as we can, meaning, we should try to resist it. ([Location 13398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13398))

- Recognizing Paul’s engagements with this group of counter-missionaries is a key move as we try to purge these passages of their anti-Judaism.

- We have already seen how Paul had to negotiate his shockingly radical new missionary approach with the other Jewish leaders of the early church. This process culminated in a gathering in Jerusalem over the winter of 49–50 CE, during which an important deal was made. Peter would lead a mission to the Judeans, which would proceed in conventional Jewish terms; Paul would lead a mission to the pagan nations, which would continue in a more diverse way, and he would also send a great deal of money to Jerusalem to assist their ministry to the poor. But not everyone accepted the Jerusalem deal. As is common in deep conflicts, a small, militant faction did not accept the decision of the majority at the meeting and set out to undermine it. We will call them “the enemies,” since this is what Paul calls them once in an uncharitable moment.17 ([Location 13462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13462))
- Reading between the lines, the enemies thought that only circumcision and complete commitment to the Torah would generate right behavior.

- The enemies, however, are much more aggressive colonizers. They want Paul’s converts to embrace Judaism in toto! There will be no careful adoption of local pagan forms but a comprehensive introduction of Jewish structures alongside the introduction of an appropriate relationality. Pagan culture, except where it fortuitously overlaps with Judaism, must be erased, and Paul’s Christian converts will become messianic Jews. And most significantly, in support of this agenda, the enemies seem to have done something that Christians through the ages have done as well. ([Location 13488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13488))
- They took the practices that they cared about ethically and built them into salvation. Becoming a Jew and doing all the deeds prescribed by Torah are how you get saved, they claimed. “Do them or go to hell!—but do them well and you go to heaven!” We know well by now that this move conditionalizes salvation and shifts it into a contractual form. ([Location 13492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13492))
- The enemies seem to have believed that Jesus was the Messiah, resurrected on the third day, and that his death, with its shed blood, had atoning value, although to just what extent is hard to say. But this embrace of Jesus and his significance was far too limited. He might have been confessed as Lord, but he was not operating as Lord over the enemies’ understandings of the truth and ethics! ([Location 13499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13499))
- We learn from the enemies, then, that colonizers reify parts of their culture as God-given—as a foundation—which makes them nonnegotiable forms that must be imposed on any converts.19 Christological scrutiny is thereby also blocked, which means that any structures endorsed fundamentally—here Jewish—along with any inappropriate relationality embedded in those (perhaps the legitimacy of violence in their defense) will not be subject to the overarching challenge of a loving triune relationality either. Moreover, any differences from these nonnegotiable forms are to be condemned. Such differences are sinful and wrong. So the colonial project operative here has a certain impermeability built into it, along with a characteristic self-righteousness. Everyone must look the same. Disaster!

- In chapter 13 we discussed the virtue of faith, including a careful description of the way it involves, but is not reducible to, believing.21 We spent some time there exploring how Paul grounds our faith in Jesus’s faith. We saw then that Paul loves to use the terminology of Hab 2:4, although assisted by texts like Gen 15:6 and Isa 28:16, to link the faith of his converts to the foundational faith of Jesus himself, arguing that the presence of this faith within us is a guarantee that God is at work within us by his Spirit and that we are on track for glory. We are part of the difficult part of Jesus’s life now, when he journeyed faithfully and obediently to the cross, but precisely because of this action, we know that we are on track to enjoy the resurrection and ascension that came after this for him. It is consequently an argument intended to assure us, not to tell us how to become Christians in the… ([Location 13539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13539))
- Furthermore, we have been set free, released from the need to repay the debt generated by sin now (which is death) and so “justified,” right where we are. So we do not have to wait nervously and uncertainly for a verdict on the day of judgment. God is for us because God is in us, now. And the threats of the enemies can be ignored, and on all counts.

- The enemies, thinking foundationally, want Christians to earn their way to heaven, basically by becoming Jews. If all goes well, they will be granted entry into the blessings of the age to come after the day of judgment. So resurrection is all about us and how we earn it, and an aggressive messianic colonizing project will meanwhile unfold on the ground. But Paul is investing heavily in God’s plan for resurrection, which involved the sending of his Son, who died bearing our humanity and was resurrected carrying a new humanity for us into heaven. If we are connected to him, through the Spirit, we will be resurrected. And our faith is evidence that we are part of him now and that the completion of our journey is guaranteed. ([Location 13556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13556))
- Paul’s repeated use of revelation elsewhere in Galatians now reinforces the sense in which there is no human journey to salvation from an unsaved to a saved state that is oriented primarily by human considerations—that is to say, a journey that we control and think through for ourselves. God brings us to the realization of his Son and of his truth and importance by revealing these things to us, as they were first revealed to Paul. So a key text from Galatians noted earlier bears repeating here: But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me so that I might preach him among the pagans, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. (1:15–16) ([Location 13561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13561))
- The key point is that underlying whatever process took place God was in charge revealing himself. We know that Jesus is the Lord because the Lord has revealed it to us. So we are certainly involved in this event and are summoned to respond to the resulting relationship. God loves us and respects us as people, treating us with more dignity than we deserve. But the initiative and the effectiveness within this whole process lie with God. ([Location 13571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13571))
- I would translate Gal 2:15–16 as follows, and our problems with soteriological anti-Judaism are solved. We who were born Judeans and not pagan sinners, who know that a person is not released [from the debt of sin] through works instructed by Torah only but through the faith of Jesus Christ as well, even we believed concerning Christ Jesus that we are released through the faith of Christ and not through works instructed by Torah, [and understood further] that [as Scripture says] “all flesh will not be released through works as instructed by Torah.” ([Location 13577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13577))
- A Pauline navigation, as we have seen repeatedly in what precedes this point, should enter any new context in an incarnational mode, freely adopting the healthy relationality operative there already, along with any structures or forms that are not overtly offensive in relational terms. It is a noncolonial venture and a diversification inevitably results—a flourishing of God’s community into new, different expressions. Much still needs to be navigated locally, whether the introduction of a translated pedagogy or the reform or even abandonment of any sinful practices and structures. A transformation still needs to take place, and it can be quite dramatic. But much in the original context can be left in place as well, or at least remains recognizable after its relational modification. So a legitimate diversification in the church as a whole slowly takes place. And it is important to recall now, with the example of Paul’s enemies fresh in our minds, that one feature of this situation is a reflexive impact on the group and the parent culture that sent out the missionaries in the first place. ([Location 13594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=13594))
- When pagan converts become Christians and not Jews, the structures and forms of Judaism—the cherished customs and practices underwritten by the teachings of Moses—are necessarily revealed to be important but not mandatory, which is to say that they matter to Jews precisely as their historical and traditioned forms but do not have to matter to other people in the same way. I have taken pains to point out that they are neither trivial nor erasable. Jews are embodied, like everyone else, and the structures and forms that they act through count; they are the vehicles of their relationality and key components of their identity. They matter. God cares about them. But they matter only to this degree, which can be a humbling realization. Previously some Jews might have thought that their customs were rather more important than this. They might have thought that Jewish practices were the practices, superior to all others, and, if possible, necessarily to be adopted by all others. They should be universalized. But Paul’s mission revealed that such conclusions would be in fact to overvalue Jewish practices. They were important. They were no less, but they were also no more than this, and this implication was clearly rather galling to his messianic enemies.

If we resist this lesson, we resist Paul’s constructive account of differences in terms of diversification and return to an account of difference in terms of superiority and inferiority, to a colonial mentality, and to attendant practices of inappropriate negation and erasure.

- Historicism is not history or sheer historical analysis. Far from it. It is an underlying set of presuppositions, themselves closed off to historical analysis, holding that observable history and its causalities are all that exist. It is the assumption that reality is entirely immanent. These premises about the nature of history cannot be established by history. We do not observe or reconstruct them from the available evidence. They are really a prior metaphysics in the light of which certain types of derivative “historical” interpretation are then undertaken. Nevertheless, they are held by many modern secular scholars, and even by theistic scholars who accept the secular parameters of analysis within the modern university.

- If history works forward, immanently, and also evolves upward, the emergence of Christianity from Judaism must again be rooted in some prior deficiency within Judaism, and we will thereby return to all the problems of soteriological supersessionism, although these will play in a new key, so to speak, in grand historical mode. The new form that is Christianity emerges out of Judaism, although it is different from Judaism in many respects; consequently, it improves on Judaism, progresses beyond it, and must displace it. Jews who resist this movement resist progress, and maybe even resist “freedom” and “modernity” as well. Hegel’s terminology for this shift was a movement from “the particular” to “the universal.” God in history needed to move from the narrow details of existence to the great universal abstractions of modernity and the nation-state. So the cramped details of Judaism needed to be discarded and left behind for the massive and greatly purified reach of Christianity.

- So the only way to prevent the emergence of this demonic supersessionist variant within the analysis of Paul is by insisting that history is an open process, not a closed one. This approach still allows us to undertake sober historical analysis, but it will not be pursued in historicizing terms, which would in any case, if I am right, be reductionist. God is involved in history, and so good historical analysis needs to take this factor into account, and I have tried to do so throughout this book. Moreover, as election indicates, God’s plan for history is the real key to the ultimate direction of history, however complicated and opaque its detailed outworking might be (Rom 8:28), and we grasp this truth only after it has grasped us, through revelation. So history does not itself contain an internal upward momentum—far from it. It stands always on the edge of chaos and evil, being held against complete disintegration by a good God acting on it faithfully “from above.” The truth about history holds history in the palm of its hand. If we let go of these insights we inevitably fall back into a closed historical process, and then it is very difficult to resist building anti-Jewishness into the heart of Christianity. Moreover, any Christian commitments on the part of this type of analyst will, somewhat ironically, make supersessionism nigh on unavoidable.

- Fortunately, an open, elective view of history—which is really just to say an eschatological view of history—is undergirded by deeply Pauline claims. Almost everything he wrote makes sense only on the assumption that God exists and acts definitively through Jesus, and that our gathering in him into the triune communion is the destiny of the cosmos. This is as important and as real as it gets. It is a difficult stance to maintain within the modern academy. But if we are followers of Jesus in the terms that Paul describes, then we have no choice. We simply hold this to be true, and it is true because it has been revealed to us, so we can no more deny this reality than deny that the sun rises. Moreover, the heart of our ethic calls us to maintain these convictions with as much courage as we need to resist their erosion, if necessary to the point of death!

- Hence, given that the thrust of the schema is forward, the differences that Christianity embodies will, once again, as in the soteriological schema, have to arise out of the prior deficiencies of Israel.

- In short, we can see that whatever particular rationale we choose to run, a harsh form of Jewish accountability is again necessarily generated by any broad account of salvation history that works forward, from Judaism to Christianity.

And the Torah will be left behind somehow, for some reason, so Jewish forms and structures will ultimately be erased.

- Moreover, the gift of the Torah is, as we have seen, a double-edged sword. It is not just a treasured repository of God’s instructions about right living, although it is this. It is an opportunity at the same moment for the evil powers working on human nature and the sinful lusts present within, to seduce and to deceive Jews into sinning—a position informed by other aspects of Jewish tradition, principally by the tragic story of Adam and Eve, but underlined by the universal human experience of death. New information in the Torah about right living is also new information about wrong living, and wrong living takes people onto the pathway to death; this is the “payment” that we must all make for the accumulating debt that is our sin (Rom 6:23). So Paul’s history of Israel reduces the gift of the Torah—which remains a good gift—to an interlude between the patriarchal origins of Israel, with all their anticipations of resurrection, and their later fulfillment in Jesus’s arrival, death, and resurrection. The Torah cannot resolve the conundrum of mortality and death. Indeed, it exacerbates this situation. ([Location 14150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084GVFVGJ&location=14150))

- God has come to Israel in person, and as a result of this definitive insight, revealed to him on the road to Damascus, Paul tells the story of Israel backward, like a memoir. The significance of Israel becomes apparent in retrospect. Moreover, by telling the story of the Jews prior to Jesus in this way, Paul has avoided some very nasty traps. In particular, there is now no need to erase Judaism, including many of its precious forms and structures, when Jesus comes and Christianity emerges shortly after. It is possible to tell a story of subsequent diversification instead, and one that by this point we know well. Which is also to observe that in order to exorcise the demon of supersessionism from Pauline interpretation completely, we must press on to consider what Paul does with Jews in the present and in the future, and not merely in the past.
