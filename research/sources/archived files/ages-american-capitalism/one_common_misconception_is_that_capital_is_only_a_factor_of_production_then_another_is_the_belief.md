### A debt was a contract, the creditor’s property right. The Revolution, after all, was fought because Great Britain taxed American property without their consent. Now overzealous democratic “majorities” trampled on private property rights. Hamilton also believed debts had to be paid in full, because rich Americans, not to mention Europeans with capital to invest abroad, would not invest in the United States if men like Hezekiah Mahem could shove it down their throats. Hamilton worried over investor confidence.

### Historians disagree intensely about the relationship between capitalism and slavery. I have no room here to do justice to the debates.9 This book’s starting point is capital. Slavery is an ancient institution that has exhibited many common characteristics over centuries, but capitalization is not one of them.

### Please, Hammond instructed his legitimate white son Harry in 1856, “Do not let Louisa or any of my children or possible children be slaves of Strangers. Slavery in the family will be their happiest earthly condition.”42 No eighteenth-century U.S. slave master would likely have written such sentences to himself or his children. Hammond espoused a reconfigured, white supremacist slaveholding ideology, rooted in the familial intimacies of the plantation household—paternalism.

### Lincoln’s attack on Senator Douglas was simple. The “Slave Power” was conspiring to open not only the West but the entire United States to slavery. Douglas was aiding and abetting it. First, the Kansas-Nebraska Act had revoked the Missouri Compromise. Then in a monument to white supremacy, Chief Justice Roger Taney and the southern-controlled Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v.

### They were among the 23.5 million central, southern, and eastern Europeans—Poles, Slavs, Hungarians, Czechs, Jews, and Italians—who came to the United States during the proletarian migration of 1880 to 1920, a great number of whom planned to return and subsequently did.6 Meanwhile they transformed U.S. labor markets, and their supply of waged labor made possible industrialization, including Carnegie’s steelworks.

### In the West, given the absence of waterways, there was no market access without the railroads. Illustrated here is the American railroad network by century’s end, but also the extraordinary power that the great railroad corporations exercised over commercial farmers in the Plains states, the hotbed of the Populist Revolt.

### Whether out of sheer panic or a belief that Germany was now following a renegade path, half of Germany’s gold reserves now left the country. It could not make its outstanding reparations payments. In June, Hoover announced a plan to delay all political debt payments, including German reparations. France balked, but by July, when it finally agreed to suspend a portion of Germany’s political debts, the German financial system had already collapsed.

### To this day, the owners of capital level the same charges against government. Back then capitalists complained especially about the 1936 “undistributed profits tax,” which taxed profits that companies did not immediately invest or distribute through wages or dividends—a direct policy assault on the precautionary hoarding of corporate cash.

### Law School professor Robert H. Bork argued that the “only goal that should guide interpretation of the antitrust laws is the welfare of consumers,” which was best served by the efficient market allocation of goods free of government regulation. Low consumer prices, not general market structure or barriers to entry in enterprise, were the only proper standards for the application of antitrust laws. Besides, market competition would always blow down any barrier to entry worth blowing down.
