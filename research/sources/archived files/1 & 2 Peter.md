### Highlights

- In the one, 1 Peter, we have an extended exhortation for the church to take up, dwell in, and live out of its identity as "the elect, the exiles of the Diaspora" (1:1 DH), a chosen people called out from the wider social and political orders to embody and display God's transforming holiness and love as its peculiar mission among the nations. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=155))
- In this messianic calling, the church, like the Messiah, will often encounter disdain, opposition, and even persecution from those who continue to live under the reign and by the rules of other gods and lords. In carrying out their mission, the people of the Messiah must therefore prepare themselves for suffering. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=157))
- At the very heart of this first epistle stands the figure of Jesus Christ as the one who suffers. As the suffering Messiah he defines the very character of messianic life. The people that has been called by God and redeemed through the Messiah's suffering and death, that shares in his resurrection and fullness of life, does not shrink from the wider world or go into hiding among the nations. It shares in the suffering and destiny of its Lord joyfully and full of confidence and lives without fear in the societies in which it finds itself. For the followers of Jesus know that God's justice is being done through them, and will be done for them, exactly because God demonstrated his justice for them and for the world in the crucifixion and resurrection of the… ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=159))
- The term "messianic;' appearing frequently in the commentary, needs some explanation. Why not simply "Christian"? What is signaled with the term "messianic"? First and most obviously the term links the people and way of life designated messianic with the Messiah Jesus. The "messianic" in the New Testament is not a free-floating concept awaiting our bestowal of attributes. On the contrary, it is fully enacted, summed up, and defined by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth… ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=166))
- radical trust in the Father is itself the very enactment and definition of the messianic. At the same time, Jesus does not substitute a "spiritual" or "religious" messiahship in the place of social, economic, and political ones. Rather, trusting in the Father, he enacts in his concrete historical life and death, within the concrete historical conditions of his time, an alternative sociopolitical messianic life and calls his followers to participate in and imitate that messianic life… ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=172))
- The believers to whom he writes are being scorned, abused, and made to suffer in various ways at the hands of their unbelieving neighbors and rulers. Peter… ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=180))
- Among the number of modern commentaries on 1 Peter that I use, I rely especially on two superb comprehensive works to guide me through the issues of text, language, history, and culture: Achtemeier 1996 and Elliott 2000. Boring 1999 is also invariably useful, and Calvin 1963 never fails to illuminate, instruct, and kindle a passion for God and his reign… ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=192))
- When we come to 2 Peter we find ourselves in an atmosphere very different from the first epistle, one not frequently breathed by Western (Protestant) Christian readers and that therefore requires a kind of acclimatization. What shall we think, for example, when the language ofgnosis ("knowledge") rather than pistis ("faith") predominates; when salvation is thought of as rescue from the corruption that comes from desire; when eschatological fulfillment is rendered as participation in the divine nature; when the Christian life is described most fully in terms of knowledge and virtue (arete); when the transfiguration (rather than, say, the cross and resurrection) is put… ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=194))
- In the first instance, however, I was delivered from Kasemann's hyper-Protestant judgment against 2 Peter not by reading in Orthodoxy, but by reading the outstanding 1983 commentary on the epistle by Richard Bauckham. Bauckham provides a definitive rejoinder to Kasemann. Bauckham's own reading of 2 Peter may be characterized as a kind of cautious hellenization thesis-but certainly not hellenization pure and simple. Bauckham demonstrates persuasively that what we find in 2 Peter is a "surprising combination of Hellenism and [Jewish cosmic] apocalyptic" (1983: 154).5 That is the lead I followed, and the one that led me to explore some of the treasures of Orthodoxy as a means of discerning and… ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=207))
- At the heart of 2 Peter is a profound and passionate declaration of the divine justice, authority, and glory of Jesus Christ revealed in the transfiguration, ofhis imminent glorious coming that will purify and transform all of creation and make it the home of righteousness, and of the… ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=212))
- perhaps something of a clue to the resolution might be found in the transfiguration as the apocalypse of Christ… ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=219))
- The church proclaims and enacts primary justice among the nations to the extent that it participates in, lives by, and witnesses to the justice done in Christ's substitutionary suffering, an act vindicated by the Father through the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit. As Peter writes, Christ's being "put to death by flesh" was met, not with more death dealing "for the sake of the greater good;' but with an excess of divine goodness, with resurrection, with being "made alive by the Spirit" (3:18).14 Therein the new world order comes intobeing. Messianic self-offering, resurrection, and life in the Spirit is God's way of making the world right. That is the gospel of God's justice. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1317))
- Rather, he reveals how the risen and ascending Christ announced God's judgment on spiritual powers in rebellion against God who cause evil. That leads up to Peter's final declaration that all "angels, authorities,and powers" have been subjected to Christ (3:22). In making this argument, Peter draws on Jewish traditions about "the days of Noah."" ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1323))
- These "spirits" that came from the bodies of the giants fathered by the Watchers through human women were the cause of the human evil that led to the great flood… ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1332))
- the spirits to whom Christ preached should be understood as fallen angels and/or demonic spirits. Their imprisonment represents in spatial terms God's restraining power over them, and the message Christ preached to them is the confirmation that "the day of the great conclusion;' first announced by the flood, is now upon them. Christ's ascension itselfmayhave been the proclamation oftheir defeat.... In other words, the apostle Peter is… ([Location 1335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1335))
- By referring to this tradition about "the days of Noah," Peter is declaring that Christ's "proclamation to the spirits in prison" is a clear sign that he has authority over all of the powers of evil that might oppress the messianic community either from… ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1337))
- In the days of Noah God "waited patiently" while Noah constructed the ark of salvation for the "eight souls" who were saved "through water" (di'hydatos; 3:20).The ark with its eight souls is a figure of the messianic community amid the nations of the world, nations that have succumbed to evil powers that hold them in bondage and incite them to bring persecution and suffering upon God's people. Baptism is the salvation of God's messianic community, not because baptismal water itself is effective ("not as a removal of… ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1339))
- Baptism seals our participation in the victory of Christ over the powers through his crucifixion and resurrection (cf. Rom. 6). Baptism then is also "a pledge of a good conscience toward God" (1 Pet. 3:21 DH), for in our baptism we renounce all the powers of evil, give thanks to God for our rescue from destruction… ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1344))
- The "good conscience" of the messianic community, its hopeful and fearless witness to God's new order, comes not from its ability to control its own destiny, but from its confidence in the divine sovereignty of the Messiah. God has overcome and subjugated to Christ those powers that enslave… ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1347))
- But what are the "angels," "authorities" (exousiai), and "powers" (dynameis) of which Peter writes? Peter joins Paul (Rom. 8:38; 1 Cor. 2:6-8; Gal. 4:3; Eph. 1:21; 2:2; 6:12; Col. 2:8) in using these terms to designate all of those creaturely powers, whether personal or impersonal, whether beneficent or malevolent, whether spiritual, cosmic, or earthly, that would "separate us from… ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1349))
- We have to speak about these powers. We have to do so because we see them and know them and know about them and have to take their reality and efficacy into account. We have to do so because in all their strangeness they are real and efficacious. World history, being the history ofman and humanity, ofAdamic humanity which has fallen from God, is also the history of innumerable absolutisms ofdifferent kinds, of forces that are truly and properly man's own but that have won a certain autonomy, independence, and even superiority in relation to him. There they are, powerful enough in and in spite of their impotence to be too much for the one who can and should be their lord and to take him to task, to master him who should master them, influencing, determining, and controlling his thought and speech and also his purposes and enterprises for himself and in his common life with others. If they are only pseudo -objective realities, strangely enough they are still powerful realities which make a fine display of their lying objectivity. If their power is only a usurped and creaturely one, and therefore relative and limited, nevertheless even in its relativity and limitation it is a highly effective one in its outward penetration and expansion. If they work only "as if" they were legitimate, this "as if" is clearand convincing and even forceful enough to fill… ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1352))
- They are not just the potencies but the real factors and agents of human progress, regress, and stagnation in politics, economics, scholarship, technology, and art, and also of the evolutions and retardations in all the personal life of the individual. It is not really people who do things, whether leaders or the masses. Through mankind's fault, things are invisibly done without and above man, even above the human individual in all his uniqueness, by the host of absolutisms,… ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1362))
- We can discern these "lordless" powers and their effect upon human life and history by asking ourselves some probing questions. Who or what would claim our highest allegiance, for whom or what do we give our bodies as sacrifices or, more determinative, the bodies of our own and others' children-a king, queen, emperor, the people; a city, nation, empire; an ideal such as law, justice, freedom, democracy? In whom or what do we put our trust and hope, who will save… ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1365))

- What end fuels our most dedicated labors-pleasure, wealth, fame, power, victory, defiance, oblivion?

- Nevertheless, "elect exiles of the Diaspora," followers of the crucified, risen, and sovereign Messiah, have been delivered through him from slavery to those powers. They now forswear looking to anyone or anything other than him as the final object of their allegiance, hope, and labor. He is Lord of all powers. Refusing allegiance to the powers, the people of this Lord find themselves as "strangers and aliens"… ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1373))
- To whom then shall the messianic people turn, when the real world effectively sustained by the angels, authorities, and powers turns against them and they are subjected to marginalization, disdain, persecution, suffering, even death? How shall these exiles sustain a good conscience in the face of all of that and not succumb again to the powers through carelessness, cowardice, compromise, or capitulation? Peter's answer is straightforward: despite their claims and appearances, none of those powers holds final sway, none has the last word, none is anything other than a finite creature subject to the authority of the infinite creator, and therefore none is worthy of our fear, our ultimate allegiance, or our… ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1379))
- As Paul also writes, "God put [his] power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the age to come. And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things… ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1383))
- spiritual, cosmic, political sovereignty of the triune God alone evokes and sustains the free and joyful existence of the church, the body of Christ, the "ark" of God, constituted through baptism "in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit," which… ([Location 1386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1386))
- Messianic people are called to an exilic, diasporic existence in their natural homelands. Those are not homelands defined by physical geography, but by who rules, and what the rules are, that is, by… ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002YT8GRY&location=1388))
