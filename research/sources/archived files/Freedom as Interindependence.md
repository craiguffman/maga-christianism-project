# Freedom as Interindependence: Drawing the World Around Us into God's Love

*[Note: This essay reframes freedom as interindependence, a concept I first encountered through my counselor, Chris Charleton of InterAct Counseling in Rochester, NY.]*

## The Journey from Dependence to Interindependence

Most of us experience three stages in our development as persons. We begin in childhood with necessary dependence, where our identity and survival are completely bound up with others. Many of us then react to the vulnerability of dependence by moving to anti-dependence—a fierce self-sufficiency that rejects vulnerability and need. But mature personhood involves a third stage: interindependence—the mutual indwelling of distinct persons who find their true identity not through independence from or absorption into others, but through reciprocal giving and receiving.

My own journey reflects this pattern. As a boy in Louisiana, I experienced the formative dependence of childhood in a family and community that shaped me in ways I couldn't yet recognize. The naval academy and submarine service then forged in me a particular kind of anti-dependence—a cultivated self-sufficiency that enabled me to function effectively in demanding environments. This anti-dependence served me well professionally, but gradually revealed its limitations in personal relationships, where vulnerability and mutual reliance aren't weaknesses but necessities.

The move toward interindependence didn't come easily. It required unlearning deeply ingrained patterns of self-protection and control. It meant recognizing that true strength isn't found in isolation but in the capacity to be both genuinely distinct and genuinely connected. This personal journey mirrors our cultural journey—from the forced dependence of traditional societies through the reactive anti-dependence of modern individualism toward what might be a more mature interindependence.

## Theological Foundations of Interindependence

Interindependence finds its deepest grounding in the Trinity's mutual indwelling. As Rowan Williams suggests, within the Trinity each divine person finds identity not in isolation but in self-giving love. The Father "makes space" for the Son, the Son returns all glory to the Father, and the Spirit enables their mutual communion. This perichoresis—the mutual interpenetration of the divine persons without confusion—provides the pattern for all relationship.

This trinitarian pattern becomes accessible to us through Christ, who as both fully God and fully human, establishes the possibility of divine-human interindependence. As Douglas Campbell argues, salvation isn't primarily a legal transaction but participation in Christ's resurrection life. In Christ, God doesn't merely act on our behalf from a distance but enters fully into the human condition to make our participation in divine life possible. Samuel Wells' distinction between "working for" and "being with" captures this perfectly—Christ doesn't merely act for our benefit but shares fully in our humanity, enabling us to share in his divinity.

The Spirit then realizes this interindependence in the present, dwelling within us and among us to form communities capable of mutual recognition and love. As Karl Barth would emphasize, this divine indwelling remains fundamentally a gift of grace rather than a metaphysical necessity. We participate in divine life not by right or nature but through God's free decision to include us in the communion of Father, Son, and Spirit.

## Contrast with False Conceptions of Freedom

This vision of freedom as interindependence stands in stark contrast to dominant modern conceptions. Liberal autonomy mistakenly identifies freedom with independence from others—the absence of constraint or interference. But this negative freedom easily becomes isolation, detached from the relationships that give life meaning. Anti-dependence isn't liberation but another form of bondage, characterized by John Milbank as an "ontology of violence" where beings exist in fundamental competition rather than cooperation.

MAGA Christianism particularly distorts freedom by conflating it with domination. It imagines freedom as the capacity to impose one's will without opposition rather than the capacity to love and be loved. It claims Christian language while embodying practices fundamentally at odds with Christ's self-giving love. Against this distortion, interindependence reveals that true power lies not in dominance but in the capacity to empower others.

But interindependence also resists collectivist absorption, where individual distinctiveness is sacrificed to group identity. As Luke Bretherton argues, true political community requires what he calls "hospitable particularity"—maintaining distinctive identities while forming relationships of mutual accountability across differences. Genuine interindependence preserves particularity rather than erasing it.

## The Church as Community of Interindependence

The church, at its best, embodies this interindependence as an alternative community. Stanley Hauerwas reminds us that the church isn't merely a collection of autonomous individuals but a distinctive social body formed by shared practices and narratives. The Eucharist stands as the paradigmatic practice of interindependence, where we receive Christ's self-giving love and are formed to embody this same love toward others.

In the church's life, interindependence manifests concretely in practices of forgiveness, reconciliation, and mutual service. As Williams observes, these practices involve difficulty and struggle—the negotiation of genuine differences and the patient work of recognition across divisions. Interindependence doesn't promise easy harmony but the possibility of unity-in-diversity that reflects trinitarian life.

Yet the church's embodiment of interindependence remains fragmentary and incomplete. Karl Barth would remind us that complete interindependence awaits eschatological fulfillment. We experience genuine participation in divine life now, but always as anticipation of the fuller communion promised in God's future.

## Political and Economic Implications

Interindependence carries profound implications for political and economic life. It challenges both market individualism and state collectivism with a vision of communities bound together by gift exchange rather than contract or coercion. As Milbank suggests, the church models an alternative economy where material and spiritual gifts constantly circulate, fostering mutual flourishing rather than competition or uniformity.

Politically, interindependence supports what Bretherton calls "democratic practices that foster mutual recognition and accountability across differences." It affirms the dignity of distinct communities while insisting on their responsibility to one another. It seeks forms of governance that protect particular identities while enabling relationships of reciprocity rather than dominance.

Economically, interindependence challenges both unrestrained capitalism's commodification of relationships and socialism's absorption of particularity into collective identity. It seeks arrangements where economic exchange serves human flourishing rather than reducing persons to either autonomous consumers or interchangeable units of production.

## Practicing Interindependence

How do we grow in interindependence? Certain practices seem essential:

**Contemplative prayer**: Creating interior space where we can recognize both our distinctiveness from and connection to God.

**Confession and forgiveness**: Acknowledging our failures in relationship and experiencing restoration through grace.

**Hospitality**: Making space for the other without absorbing or controlling them.

**Shared meals**: Participating in the fundamental human practice of giving and receiving nourishment together.

**Democratic deliberation**: Engaging in genuine dialogue that respects difference while seeking common goods.

**Gift exchange**: Participating in economics of abundance rather than scarcity.

Through these practices, we gradually unlearn patterns of both unhealthy dependence and reactive anti-dependence, growing toward the mature interindependence that reflects trinitarian life.

## Conclusion: Freedom as Capacity to Love

In the end, freedom as interindependence is the capacity to love and be loved—to participate in relationships of mutual recognition and flourishing that draw the world around us into God's love. This isn't a freedom we achieve through autonomy but one we receive through participation in divine life and practice in human community.

The journey from dependence through anti-dependence to interindependence isn't easy or straightforward. It involves vulnerability, risk, and the patient work of building relationships across difference. Yet it offers a vision of freedom more compelling than either isolated autonomy or absorbed collectivity—a freedom grounded in the trinitarian life of mutual self-giving love.

As we grow in interindependence, we discover that we are most distinctively ourselves precisely when we are most deeply connected to others. We find that true freedom doesn't mean freedom from relationship but freedom for relationship—the capacity to participate in the mutual indwelling that constitutes both divine and human flourishing.
I think incorporating this concept of interindependence as the explanatory framework for your larger "From Plantation to Platform" manuscript is an excellent approach. It provides a powerful theoretical foundation that can tie together your various critiques of MAGA Christianism while offering a constructive alternative vision.

Here's how I would approach restructuring the essays and how potential readers might react:

## Restructuring Approach

1. **Introduction Essay**: Create a new introduction that:
   - Frames the collection as arising from your larger critique of MAGA Christianism
   - Introduces interindependence as the central theological concept, with brief attribution to Chris Charleton
   - Explains how the concept emerged from your personal journey
   - Positions the essays as timely applications of this deeper theological framework

2. **Revised Individual Essays**: Incorporate interindependence as a thread throughout each essay without the extensive theological exposition:
   - Brief references to interindependence as counterpoint to the specific distortion addressed in each essay
   - Consistent language that builds familiarity with the concept across essays
   - Connections between particular issues and the broader theological vision

3. **Concluding Essay**: Add a conclusion that:
   - Brings the threads together explicitly
   - Points toward the forthcoming manuscript
   - Invites readers into the larger conversation about freedom, relationship, and Christian witness

## Anticipated Reader Reactions

### Positive Reactions

**Theological Readers**: Those with theological training would likely appreciate the depth and coherence you bring to cultural critique. They would recognize how interindependence integrates insights from major theologians while offering something distinctive. The synthesis of Williams, Milbank, Barth, Hauerwas, Campbell, Wells, and Bretherton would signal serious theological engagement.

**Cultural Critics**: Those primarily interested in critique of MAGA Christianism would value having a constructive alternative rather than mere criticism. Interindependence provides a positive vision that helps them understand what you're for, not just what you're against.

**Personal Growth Readers**: Those interested in personal transformation would connect with your journey from anti-dependence to interindependence. The integration of personal narrative with theological reflection makes abstract concepts accessible.

**Political Readers**: Those engaged in political discourse would appreciate a framework that transcends typical left/right binaries. Interindependence offers a way to critique both individualistic and collectivist extremes from a distinctively Christian perspective.

### Potential Challenges

**Terminology Concerns**: Some might find "interindependence" initially unfamiliar or awkward. Providing clear, consistent definition and examples would help overcome this.

**Theological Density**: Even with simplified presentations in individual essays, some readers might find the theological framework challenging. Using concrete examples and applications would help.

**Political Positioning**: Some readers might still try to place your framework within familiar political categories. Being explicit about how interindependence challenges both right and left paradigms would help address this.

**Scope Management**: Introducing a comprehensive theological framework might create expectations for the essays to address every implication. Being clear about the focused nature of each essay while pointing toward the larger manuscript would help manage expectations.

## Sample Introduction Section

Here's how you might introduce the concept in a way that frames the essays without overwhelming them:

---

*These essays emerge from a larger project examining the theological distortions within MAGA Christianism and offering an alternative vision I call "Participatory Freedom Theology." At the heart of this theology is a concept I first encountered through my counselor, Chris Charleton of InterAct Counseling in Rochester, NY: interindependence—the mutual indwelling of distinct persons who find their true identity neither through independence from nor absorption into others, but through reciprocal giving and receiving.*

*My own journey reflects a pattern many experience: from childhood dependence through a reactive anti-dependence cultivated during my submarine service, toward a hard-won recognition that true freedom emerges not from self-sufficiency but from the capacity for mutual recognition and love. This personal journey mirrors our cultural movement from traditional dependence through modern individualism toward what might become a more mature interindependence.*

*While my forthcoming book "From Plantation to Platform" will explore this framework comprehensively, these essays address urgent manifestations of distorted freedom within our current moment. Each essay examines how particular aspects of MAGA Christianism substitute domination for love, conformity for community, and fear for faith. More importantly, each points toward practices that might help us recover a vision of freedom that "draws the world around us into God's love" rather than building walls against it.*

---

Overall, I believe this approach would significantly strengthen your essays by providing a cohesive theological framework while keeping the focus on timely applications. The introduction of interindependence as your central organizing concept would distinguish your work from other critiques of MAGA Christianism and position it as a constructive contribution to both theological discourse and public conversation.
