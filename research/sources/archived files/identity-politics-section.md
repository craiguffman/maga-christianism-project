# MAGA Hot Buttons: Identity Politics and DEI Through a Theological Lens

## Additional Chapter for Part IV: Addressing Contemporary Flashpoints

### Chapter 17: Beyond the Identity Trap – Race, Justice, and Christian Witness
**Video Script: "Neither Color-Blind Nor Color-Bound"**
> The debate over DEI initiatives and critical race theory has become one of the most divisive flashpoints in American politics. MAGA Christianism portrays DEI as an existential threat to American values, while progressive activists often present it as the only path to racial justice. But what if both approaches reflect distorted anthropologies that either deny the reality of racial injustice or reduce human identity to racial categories? Drawing from Yascha Mounk's critique of the "Identity Synthesis," we can recognize how both color-blindness and what he calls "Strong Identity Politics" fail to address the deeper theological question: what does it mean to be human before God? The Christian tradition offers a more nuanced anthropology that both acknowledges the reality of racial injustice while refusing to reduce human identity to immutable characteristics. Today, I invite you to consider how Christian humanism provides resources for addressing racial injustice without succumbing to the identity trap.

#### 1. "The Identity Trap: A Theological Analysis of America's Race Debate"
This post would analyze Mounk's critique of the "Identity Synthesis" through a theological lens, showing how both color-blindness and strong identity politics represent anthropological distortions from a Christian perspective. Drawing on Hooker's method of arguing from first principles, I would show how both positions depart from a Christian understanding of human dignity as rooted in our creation in God's image and our baptismal identity in Christ.

The key theological moves would include:
- Critiquing the "Identity Synthesis" assumption that immutable characteristics determine one's moral authority and epistemological standpoint
- Examining how this conflicts with a Christian understanding of truth as accessible to all through God's self-revelation
- Analyzing how the "common humanity" approach often ignores structural injustice
- Showing how the Christian tradition offers resources for acknowledging both our common humanity and our particular social locations

I would conclude by drawing on Kavin Rowe's work on Luke-Acts to show how early Christianity created communities that acknowledged ethnic and social differences while refusing to make them determinative of one's identity or authority within the community.

#### 2. "Neither Color-Blind Nor Color-Bound: Race Through a Theological Lens"
This post would develop a distinctively Christian approach to race that avoids both the blindness to injustice found in MAGA Christianism and the reductionism found in some progressive approaches. Building on Douglas Campbell's work on Paul, I would show how Christian identity transcends without erasing particular identities.

Key theological moves would include:
- Examining how Paul acknowledged ethnic differences while insisting they were not determinative within the body of Christ
- Exploring how baptismal identity creates a "third race" that doesn't erase particular identities but relativizes them
- Analyzing how the Pentecost narrative models a unity-in-diversity that maintains particularity without division
- Showing how this differs from both assimilationist and separatist approaches to racial difference

I would use Hooker's concept of "special equity" to argue that addressing racial injustice requires attention to particular contexts rather than universal prescriptions, while still maintaining that our fundamental identity is found in Christ rather than immutable characteristics.

#### 3. "The Practices of Reconciliation: Beyond DEI Programs and Anti-CRT Legislation"
This post would move from theoretical critique to practical application, examining how Christian practices might form communities capable of addressing racial injustice without reducing people to racial categories. Drawing on Samuel Wells' concept of "being with" rather than merely "working for," I would outline practices that foster reconciliation beyond both DEI bureaucracy and right-wing backlash.

Key theological moves would include:
- Contrasting procedural approaches to diversity with formational practices of reconciliation
- Examining how eucharistic practice forms us to see difference as gift rather than threat
- Exploring how confession and lament create space for acknowledging injustice without essentializing identity
- Analyzing how practices of hospitality train us to welcome the stranger without demanding assimilation

I would conclude by showing how these practices might shape Christian communities to be witnesses to a different way of addressing racial injustice—one that neither denies the reality of structural racism nor reduces human identity to racial categories.

#### 4. "From Identity Politics to Participatory Politics: A Christian Alternative"
This post would develop a constructive alternative to both MAGA's rejection of race-conscious policies and progressive identity politics. Drawing on Oliver O'Donovan's concept of political identity as action rather than being, I would outline a participatory politics that addresses injustice while maintaining the priority of agency over identity.

Key theological moves would include:
- Contrasting identity politics (based on who we are) with participatory politics (based on what we do together)
- Examining how the Christian tradition emphasizes being-in-action rather than static identity
- Exploring how this approach might address racial disparities without essentializing racial categories
- Analyzing how this might reshape debates over affirmative action, reparations, and other race-conscious policies

I would conclude by showing how Christian humanism offers resources for a politics that acknowledges the reality of historical and ongoing racial injustice while refusing to reduce human identity to racial categories or make racial identity determinative of one's moral authority.

## Additional Chapter for Part III: The Theological Roots of Christian Nationalism

### Chapter 18: Practical Atheism and American Exceptionalism
**Video Script: "America's Salvation Story"**
> MAGA Christianism often presents America as a nation with a divine mission—a "city on a hill" uniquely blessed by God to spread freedom and democracy. This narrative of American exceptionalism functions as an alternative salvation story—one where America, rather than Christ, becomes the primary agent of God's work in the world. Drawing from Hauerwas' critique of Niebuhr, we can see how practical atheism enables Christians to subscribe to a nationalist soteriology while maintaining formal Christian identity. When America becomes the primary vehicle of God's purposes, Christianity is reduced to providing moral support for the nation's projects rather than forming disciples who participate in Christ's reconciling work. Today, I invite you to consider how the narrative of American exceptionalism functions as an alternative gospel that displaces Christ's lordship while maintaining Christian language and symbols.

**Substack Posts:**

#### 1. "American Exceptionalism as Alternative Soteriology"
This post would analyze how American exceptionalism functions as an alternative salvation narrative that displaces Christ's lordship while retaining Christian language. Drawing on Hauerwas' critique of Niebuhr, I would show how practical atheism enables Christians to embrace nationalist soteriology while maintaining formal Christian identity.

Key theological moves would include:
- Contrasting biblical salvation history with the narrative of American exceptionalism
- Examining how "city on a hill" rhetoric transforms a warning to the church into a promise to the nation
- Analyzing how manifest destiny substituted America for Israel as God's chosen instrument
- Showing how this narrative enables Christians to pursue national greatness rather than cruciform faithfulness

I would conclude by showing how this alternative soteriology shapes policy positions on immigration, foreign policy, and religious liberty—areas where MAGA Christianism often departs from traditional Christian ethics.

#### 2. "The Theological Foundations of Christian Nationalism"
This post would examine how practical atheism provides the theological scaffolding for Christian nationalism. Building on Rogers Smith's analysis of American civic myths, I would show how Christian nationalist historiography supplies a theological justification for exclusionary nationalism.

Key theological moves would include:
- Examining how the absence of Christ from ethical reasoning enables the substitution of national interest for Christian witness
- Analyzing how the "Christian nation" narrative creates a false continuity between Christian identity and American identity
- Exploring how this narrative justifies privileging Christianity in law and policy
- Showing how this narrative depends on historical mythmaking that sanitizes America's past

I would conclude by showing how Christian nationalism represents a fundamental theological error—not merely a political preference—that subordinates Christ's lordship to national identity.

#### 3. "Civil Religion and Its Discontents"
This post would analyze American civil religion through a theological lens, examining how it functions as a "domestication of transcendence" (William Cavanaugh) that enables Christianity to serve national purposes. Drawing on Douglas Campbell's critique of natural theology, I would show how civil religion relies on a concept of "God" abstracted from Christ's particularity.

Key theological moves would include:
- Contrasting biblical revelation with civil religion's "God of the philosophers"
- Examining how civil religion enables Christians to support policies contrary to Christ's teaching
- Analyzing how the "God Bless America" deity differs from the God revealed in Jesus Christ
- Showing how civil religion serves to sanctify national power rather than calling it to account

I would conclude by showing how civil religion represents another manifestation of practical atheism—affirming God's existence while acting as if God has not revealed himself definitively in Christ.

#### 4. "The Church as Alternative Politics: Resisting Nationalist Captivity"
This post would develop a constructive alternative to Christian nationalism based on the church as an alternative political community. Drawing on Kavin Rowe's work on Luke-Acts, I would show how early Christianity understood itself as a distinctive "culture" with political implications that transcended national boundaries.

Key theological moves would include:
- Contrasting nationalist politics with ecclesial politics
- Examining how the early church understood itself as a transnational community
- Exploring how baptismal identity relativizes national identity without erasing it
- Analyzing how Christian practices form an alternative politics to nationalism

I would conclude by showing how the church's witness depends on maintaining its distinctive political identity—not as one interest group among others within the nation, but as a transnational community whose primary citizenship is in heaven.

## Additional Application Section for Chapter 16: Christian Humanism in Practice

### Application: Reimagining Immigration through Christian Humanism
**Video Script: "The Stranger in Our Midst"**
> Few issues have been more central to MAGA politics than immigration—often framed as a threat to national security, cultural identity, and economic stability. This framing reflects all three theological mutations we've explored: primitive biblicism that proof-texts scripture without contextual understanding, practical atheism that prioritizes national interest over Christian witness, and binary apocalypticism that divides the world into worthy citizens and threatening aliens. Christian humanism offers a different approach—one that acknowledges legitimate concerns about sovereignty and security while recognizing the divine image in every migrant. Drawing from biblical narratives of exile, welcome, and boundary-crossing love, Christian humanism helps us see immigration not primarily as a threat but as an opportunity to practice the hospitality that characterizes God's kingdom. Today, I invite you to consider how Christian practices might form us to respond to immigration challenges with wisdom rather than fear.

**Key Theological Moves:**

1. **Critique of Primitive Biblicism in Immigration Debates**
- Analyzing how both sides selectively use biblical texts without appropriate context
- Examining how the "special equity" approach would address immigration complexities
- Showing how attention to particularity helps us move beyond abstract principles to concrete responses
- Developing a more holistic biblical theological framework for understanding migration

2. **Critique of Practical Atheism in Immigration Policy**
- Exposing how national interest often displaces Christian witness in policy positions
- Examining how Christ's example challenges utilitarian approaches to immigration
- Analyzing how the church's transnational identity relativizes border concerns
- Showing how practical atheism enables Christians to support policies contrary to Christian principles

3. **Critique of Binary Apocalypticism in Immigration Rhetoric**
- Analyzing how friend/enemy distinctions shape dehumanizing rhetoric about immigrants
- Examining how apocalyptic literature properly understood challenges such binary thinking
- Showing how reconciliation rather than opposition characterizes Christian eschatology
- Developing a theological framework that acknowledges complexity without reducing to binary oppositions

4. **Christian Humanist Practices for Immigration Engagement**
- Hospitality as witness in a fearful world
- Truthful storytelling that acknowledges complexity
- Policy advocacy grounded in human dignity rather than mere utility
- Church practices that form us to see Christ in the stranger

This application section would demonstrate how the theoretical critique of MAGA Christianism's theological mutations can reshape our approach to a concrete policy issue. It would acknowledge legitimate concerns about immigration policy while showing how Christian humanism offers resources for a more faithful response than either MAGA nativism or progressive open borders advocacy.
