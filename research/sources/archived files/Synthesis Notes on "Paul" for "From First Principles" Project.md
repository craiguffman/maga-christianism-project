# Synthesis Notes on "Paul" for "From First Principles" Project

## Paul's Missionary Methodology and its Implications for MAGA Christianism

Campbell's portrayal of Paul's missionary approach provides significant theological insights that challenge the core assumptions of MAGA Christianism. These notes synthesize key concepts from the text that align with your theological critique.

### On Relational Versus Transactional Theology

Paul's missionary strategy reveals a deeply relational understanding of faith that contrasts sharply with the transactional theology underlying MAGA Christianism:

"We avoid framing potential friends as victims and ourselves as patrons by entering their situations where they are, not from above, but alongside them. We must set aside our material and social capital... by following in the self-sacrificial footsteps of Jesus we can avoid the problems of initiating a relationship from a superior position."

This incarnational approach rejects the power dynamics that characterize MAGA Christianism's understanding of both evangelism and politics, suggesting that authentic Christian witness requires relinquishing rather than seeking cultural dominance.

### On Gospel as Revelation vs. Foundationalism

Campbell's analysis of Paul's conversion experience highlights how the gospel functions as divine revelation rather than human construction:

"Paul's most important insights into the nature of Judaism in the Christian era are ultimately astonishingly inclusive and constructive. He explains difference not in terms of displacement but in terms of diversification."

This revelatory understanding contrasts with MAGA Christianism's foundationalist approach that attempts to derive theological and political conclusions from premises established apart from Christ:

"Christians believe that Jesus is Lord (God), because God has revealed this to us through God's Spirit... We must remember with crystal clarity that God is in charge of how we know about God, and of the definition of what God is really like, and we must hang on to these truths through life and death."

### On Resurrection Ethics vs. Binary Apocalypticism

Campbell's emphasis on Paul's "resurrection ethics" offers a powerful counterpoint to MAGA Christianism's binary apocalypticism:

"Paul now thinks, and also constantly instructs his converts, on this basis, which is to say, in terms of what we can call a 'resurrection ethic.' Our capacity to act in a good way comes from the fact—the fact!—that we have been reconstituted mentally within the new age, that is, the age to come, from the future."

This resurrection ethic transcends the friend/enemy distinctions that characterize binary apocalypticism:

"A resurrection ethic is a relational ethic of love, in all its flourishing specific instantiations."

### On Christian Community as Alternative Polity

Campbell's portrayal of Pauline communities as alternative political entities challenges MAGA Christianism's accommodation to nationalist politics:

"Christianity has its own politics, and Christians are citizens of another polity—another nation-state... Suffice it to say here that for all the problems they raise for modern readers, the Household Codes tell us that Paul's communities were political. God is interested in the organization of every aspect of his people's lives."

This understanding of the church as a distinct polity undermines MAGA Christianism's tendency to equate Christian faithfulness with American patriotism:

"The communities are distinct, like the different parts of a body, but are irreducibly connected to one another as well—distinct but never separable then. This unity overrides local differences in status and cultural capital."

## Theological Insights for Specific Chapters

### For Chapter 5: Ramist Realism Then and Now

Campbell's analysis of Paul's understanding of scripture offers insights into the dangers of primitive biblicism:

"Without the animation of the Spirit and the summons of Christ, they are just words that have been written down by human hands with pen and ink and parchment—treasured and valuable to be sure... However, words about God's former wishes drawn from the handwritten texts that record them are sadly open to demonic exploitation unless God reiterates them overtly for us again."

This insight exposes how MAGA Christianism's decontextualized approach to scripture makes it vulnerable to manipulation by the "evil Powers."

### For Chapter 9: Reinhold Niebuhr and American Pragmatism

Campbell's critique of pragmatic politics (via Hauerwas) provides theological ammunition for your analysis of practical atheism:

"Dismayed by the political wreckage that surrounded him in Europe—two world wars fought with one another by historically Christian powers, along with the hard-heartedness of his middle- and upper-class parishioners to the plight of their factory workers—Barth detected an underlying theological crisis."

This insight helps explain how American Christianity has maintained formal doctrinal affirmations while operating as if God is absent from political deliberation.

### For Chapter 13: Justification Theory and Its Discontents

Campbell's analysis of justification theory's distorting effect on Paul's gospel provides crucial theological insights for your analysis of binary apocalypticism:

"The claims being made are only understood to be true when the Spirit reveals them to be so... This act describes an equally dramatic lift of the Son up from death in resurrection, ultimately to heavenly exaltation."

This participatory understanding of salvation challenges the contractual framework that drives MAGA Christianism's binary worldview.

### For Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism

Campbell's portrayal of Paul's economic vision provides theological resources for your vision of Christian humanism:

"A Christian economy, for the soundest theological reasons, is redistributive. It is this because it values its members, and their bodies, and so gives, and does so as God has given to us."

His emphasis on conflict resolution within Christian communities offers an alternative to culture-war politics:

"The conflict at the heart of the universe has been resolved. Hence when we fail to resolve the smallest disputes within our communities effectively, not to mention their ongoing conflicts, this is an ongoing disconfirmation of the truth of what we are saying."

## Methodological Insights for Your Theological Critique

Campbell's approach to Pauline theology suggests several methodological principles for your critique of MAGA Christianism:

1. **Christocentric Retrospection**: "Where Paul starts his account is, as always, very important. He begins with his present situation, baptized in Jesus, with a renewed mind gifted to him by the Spirit."

2. **Attention to Theological Epistemology**: "The truth of each person is the truth that he or she is informed by Jesus deeply and significantly. This relation is what makes people good and right and true, insofar as they are these things."

3. **Recognition of Diverse Expression**: "The early church was fundamentally diverse. The church as a whole was a partnership between messianic Jews, who lived fully committed Jewish lives, and converted pagans, known at this time as Christians, who in certain respects did things very differently."

4. **Vigilance Against Colonizing Tendencies**: "Missionaries must frame non-Christians as people with whom Jesus is already involved. Moreover, to this end, they must incarnate as best they can into their contexts, walking alongside the people there, eschewing the use of power and resources to effect relationships and conversions, which would be manipulative."

These methodological principles provide a framework for critiquing MAGA Christianism's departure from Pauline theology not only in its conclusions but in its fundamental approach to theological reasoning.
