# Practical Atheism: Thematic Synthesis

[Store as: #knowledge/thematic_integration/practical_atheism v1.0]

## Definition

Practical Atheism constitutes the second theological mutation in MAGA Christianism, characterized by the functional removal of Jesus as supreme exemplar and pattern for Christian life, replacing him with pragmatic political engagement disconnected from Christ's example. While maintaining explicitly Christian language and symbolism, this mutation operates as if God's character and action in Christ have no practical bearing on political decisions, economic arrangements, or social policies.

## Key Characteristics

### Theological Dimensions

1. **Compartmentalization**: Separation of "personal faith" from public and political action
   - Sources: With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas), The Hauerwas Reader
   - Example: "Jesus is my personal savior but not my political guide"

2. **Exemplar Replacement**: Substitution of political figures for Christ as pattern for action
   - Sources: Cambridge Companion to Hans Urs Von Balthasar, Hannah's Child (Hauerwas)
   - Example: Political leaders treated as divinely appointed regardless of character alignment with Christ

3. **Theological Pragmatism**: Ultimate values subordinated to "what works" politically
   - Sources: With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas critique of Niebuhr), The Great Debate (Levin)
   - Example: Moral compromise justified in service of political victories

4. **Selective Theology**: Emphasis on doctrines of salvation while neglecting implications for life
   - Sources: The Hauerwas Reader, Karl Barth and American Evangelicalism (McCormack)
   - Example: Focus on getting to heaven while ignoring kingdom ethics for present life

### Methodological Patterns

1. **Privatized Faith**: Religion reduced to personal belief without public implications
   - Sources: The Hauerwas Reader, Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)
   - Example: Faith as private spiritual comfort disconnected from economic and political life

2. **Ends-Means Separation**: Willingness to separate ends from means in pursuit of goals
   - Sources: Hannah's Child (Hauerwas), Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology (McCormack)
   - Example: "Noble lie" approach to political discourse justified by intended outcomes

3. **Abstract vs. Embodied Ethics**: Replacement of concrete practices with abstract principles
   - Sources: The Hauerwas Reader, Cambridge Companion to Hans Urs Von Balthasar
   - Example: General values statements without specific ethical commitments

4. **Ritual Without Formation**: Religious practices disconnected from character transformation
   - Sources: Hannah's Child (Hauerwas), World Upside Down (Rowe)
   - Example: Church attendance without expectation of moral formation

## Historical Genealogy

1. **Niebuhr's Legacy**: Christian realism divorced from Christ as exemplar
   - Sources: With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas), Karl Barth and American Evangelicalism (McCormack)
   - Example: Moral compromise normalized as "realism" rather than named as unfaithfulness

2. **Liberal Protestant Tradition**: Reduction of Christianity to ethical principles without theological substance
   - Sources: Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology (McCormack), Orthodox and Modern (McCormack)
   - Example: Jesus as moral teacher rather than incarnate God

3. **Civil Religion Development**: Christianity as cultural identity rather than transformative community
   - Sources: American Civil Religion, Nationalism and Civil Religion
   - Example: Faith as national identity marker rather than countercultural community

4. **Protestant-Capitalist Synthesis**: Market logic applied to theological commitments
   - Sources: Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton), Economic Framework document
   - Example: Faith as consumer choice rather than totalizing commitment

## Connection to Other Mutations

1. **Enabled by Primitive Biblicism**: Selective biblical interpretation removes Jesus as normative
   - Connected to: #knowledge/thematic_integration/primitive_biblicism
   - Example: Focus on isolated verses rather than Christ's life pattern

2. **Fuels Binary Apocalypticism**: Removal of Christ's example enables friend/enemy distinctions
   - Connected to: #knowledge/thematic_integration/binary_apocalypticism
   - Example: Without Christ's command to love enemies, absolute opposition to opponents becomes possible

## Economic Dimensions

1. **Market Priority**: Economic interests prioritized over theological commitments
   - Sources: Economic Framework document, Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)
   - Example: Policy positions determined by economic interests rather than theological principles

2. **Economic Determinism**: Treatment of market arrangements as inevitable rather than constructed
   - Sources: Jonathan Levy's work, Quinn Slobodian's analysis
   - Example: Economic inequality viewed as natural rather than result of policy choices

3. **Prosperity Theology Influence**: Material success interpreted as divine endorsement
   - Sources: Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth, The Hauerwas Reader
   - Example: Wealth treated as sign of God's favor rather than stewardship responsibility

4. **Religious Commodification**: Faith marketed as product rather than way of life
   - Sources: Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton), Hannah's Child (Hauerwas)
   - Example: Church programs designed for consumer appeal rather than formation

## Case Studies

1. **Putinism as Exemplar**: Political religion that uses Christianity while violating its core commitments
   - Sources: Putinism Unmasked, Putinism as Case Study
   - Example: "When there are only friends or foes, one helps one's friends survive and one destroys one's enemies. There is no space for one's enemies in the Putinist world view."

2. **Character vs. Policy Tradeoff**: Willingness to overlook character for political advantage
   - Sources: Why Enablers Fuel the Slide, Putinism as Case Study
   - Example: "In the history of lost democracies, the grave mistake made by accommodators is to fail to recognize that the essential test for a national leader is character, not policies."

3. **Accommodating Autocracy**: Pattern of religious leaders enabling authoritarian tendencies
   - Sources: Why Enablers Fuel the Slide, Lessons from History
   - Example: Religious leaders serving as "court prophets" rather than speaking truth to power

## Constructive Alternative

1. **Christ as Supreme Exemplar**: Jesus's life pattern as normative for all aspects of life
   - Sources: Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth, Cambridge Companion to Hans Urs Von Balthasar
   - Example: Political engagement shaped by Christ's rejection of domination

2. **Practices vs. Principles**: Formation through embodied practices rather than abstract affirmations
   - Sources: Hannah's Child (Hauerwas), The Hauerwas Reader
   - Example: Community practices that form character and virtue

3. **Church as Alternative Community**: Church as political body witnessing to different social order
   - Sources: World Upside Down (Rowe), The Hauerwas Reader
   - Example: Christian community embodying alternative to domination-based politics

4. **Incarnational "Being With"**: God's solidarity as pattern for political engagement
   - Sources: Constructing an Incarnational Theology (Wells), Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)
   - Example: "Being with" marginalized communities rather than merely "doing for" them

## Theological Response

1. **Actualistic Ontology**: Human identity determined by actions not mere beliefs
   - Sources: Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology (McCormack), Barth and Rationality
   - Example: Faith demonstrated through practice not just profession

2. **Participatory Salvation**: Salvation as participation in Christ rather than transaction
   - Sources: Why Did Jesus Have to Die, Pauline Dogmatics (Campbell)
   - Example: "It's Jesus's resurrection in which we participate that performs that rehabilitation"

3. **Cruciform Politics**: Political engagement shaped by cross rather than power
   - Sources: With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas), Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)
   - Example: Politics of self-giving love rather than domination

4. **Truthfulness as Divine Encounter**: Truth-telling as spiritual discipline
   - Sources: Truthfulness vs Team Loyalty, Theological Insights from Video Transcripts
   - Example: "Being truthful is my way of being with God"
