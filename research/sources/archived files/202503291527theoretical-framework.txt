Theoretical Framework: Complexity, Narrative, and Transformative Agency

Central Hypothesis:
Transformative agency emerges through complex interactions between individual agency, collective narratives, systemic constraints, and meaning-generating processes that transcend instrumental rationality.

Expanded Theoretical Dimensions:
1. Narrative Generativity
   - Narratives as active constitutive forces
   - Multiple narrative layers (individual, collective, theological, political)
   - Potential for radical reinterpretation

2. Beyond Instrumental Rationality
   - Critique of purely economic/rational models of agency
   - Recognition of theological and metaphysical dimensions of meaning
   - Understanding transformation as a multi-dimensional process

3. Distributed and Emergent Agency
   - Agency as a complex, non-linear phenomenon
   - Interaction between individual intentionality and collective meaning-making
   - Moments of systemic disruption as key transformative events

Methodological Innovation:
- Develop an interdisciplinary approach that integrates narrative theory, theological studies, political philosophy, and complexity sciences
- Create analytical tools that can map transformative potential across different domains of human experience
