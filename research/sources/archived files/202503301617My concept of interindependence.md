Please reflect with me on the psychology of family systems which posits an infant growing from complete dependence to independence and ultimately to maturity in interindependence. I’d like thicken my account of that concept by pointing to this as the arc of maturity in Christ where the baptized are babes who must be mentored thru imitation of Christ as supreme exemplar to maturity as fully human images of God. This mature state is freedom as God dreams of it for us, the capacity to live with God and near and distant neighbors and all of creation in mutual interindependence. It’s at that point when love, justice, beauty, and godly power intersect in our lives, though always contingently due to our finite freedom and the reality that sin and evil persist.

My goal is goal is weave developmental psychology, theological anthropology, and a profound understanding of Christian maturation, to draw on the insights from my voice and theological sources, particularly Douglas Campbell and Samuel Wells.

The developmental arc I want to describe mirrors the psychological journey from dependency to interindependence, but reframes it through a deeply theological lens of Christian formation. This perspective challenges both individualistic and authoritarian understandings of human development and spiritual growth.

Key Elements of this Theological-Psychological Framework:

1. **Dependency Stage (Infancy in Christ)**
- Complete reliance on community and mentors
- Learning through imitation of Christ as supreme exemplar
- Baptismal identity as fundamental but not yet fully realized
- Guided by practices of the faith community

2. **Independence Stage (Adolescence in Christ)**
- Developing individual agency within the faith tradition
- Learning to discern and apply biblical principles
- Potential risk of reducing faith to rules or individual achievement
- Begins to develop personal theological understanding

3. **Interindependence Stage (Mature Christian Life)**
- Recognizing mutual participation in divine life
- Freedom understood as capacity for love without domination
- Ability to live in complex, grace-filled relationship with God, neighbors, and creation
- Embracing contingency and finitude as part of human experience

Theological Framing:

My conception resonates deeply with Campbell's participatory soteriology and Wells' "being with" framework. It suggests that Christian maturity is not about achieving a static state of perfection, but about ongoing participation in Christ's resurrection life. Freedom becomes not an individual possession, but a dynamic, relational capacity for mutual recognition and love.

The intersection of love, justice, beauty, and godly power is profound. It suggests that mature Christian life is not about personal righteousness, but about creating spaces of mutual flourishing where divine attributes become tangible through human relationships.

The acknowledgment of sin and evil's persistent reality prevents this from becoming a naive optimism. Instead, it's a robust hope grounded in the belief that God's redemptive work continues through our contingent, imperfect participation.

Possible Metaphors:
- Musical ensemble (each instrument independent yet creating harmony)
- Ecological system (interdependent species creating resilient environments)
- Dance (individual movements creating collective beauty)



___


My piece draws on several key sources in my work:

1. Douglas Campbell's participatory soteriology
2. Samuel Wells' "being with" theology
3. My emphasis on freedom as capacity for love without domination
4. The critique of MAGA Christianism's reductive mutations

The metaphors are intentionally structured to:
- Challenge binary thinking
- Demonstrate freedom as relational
- Show how difference creates resilience
- Invite readers into a more complex understanding of Christian formation

Each metaphor (musical ensemble, ecological system, dance) builds on the previous one, increasing in complexity and theological depth. The language mirrors my distinctive voice—combining scholarly insight with personal narrative, maintaining hope while offering direct critique.

The piece is designed to function potentially as:
- A culminating chapter in my book
- A significant Substack essay
- A lexicon entry on freedom
- A bridge between diagnostic critique and constructive proposal

I want this to capture my vision of interindependence as a thick description of participatory freedom.

____

I will develop fully all three metaphors as a deep dive explanation of what I mean by interindependence as the thick description of the practice of participatory freedom. This will be the heart of my prescription in response to the diagnosis of seven mutations of MAGA Christianism and aimed at my Substack audience  in perhaps the culminating chapters.

I want it to illuminate the profound theological and philosophical depth of improvisation as a practice of special equity. I'll create an artifact that explores this connection more deeply, drawing on my dissertation insights about call and response, Sellars' philosophical framework, and the jazz metaphor as a lens for ethical life.

# Interindependence: Practicing Freedom Beyond MAGA Christianism's Mutations

## Prologue: Beyond Domination and Isolation

When Jesus spoke of abundant life, he wasn't describing a fortress of individual righteousness or a battlefield of cultural conquest. He was inviting us into a way of being that defies the binary mutations of MAGA Christianism—a life of genuine interindependence where freedom emerges not from power over others, but from power with others.

This is freedom as God dreams it: a dynamic, breathing ecosystem of mutual recognition where each person's flourishing becomes possible through, not in spite of, our deep interconnection.

## Metaphor One: The Musical Ensemble - Harmony Through Distinctive Voices

Imagine a jazz ensemble—not as a collection of solo performers competing for attention, but as a living organism of collaborative creativity. Each musician brings a distinctive instrument, a unique timbre, a personal history. The trumpet doesn't seek to silence the bass; the drums don't demand the saxophone conform to a single rhythm. Instead, they listen. They respond. They create something transcendent that no individual could produce alone.

### The Theological Resonance

In this ensemble, individual excellence emerges through attentive relationship. The trumpet's brilliance is revealed not by overpowering other instruments, but by creating space, by listening, by allowing the bass's deep pulse to provide foundational momentum. This is participatory freedom—where my most authentic self emerges not through isolation or domination, but through responsive listening and creative dialogue.

MAGA Christianism presents a different musical metaphor—a rigid marching band where conformity is mistaken for harmony, where individual instruments are forced into a single, militaristic beat. But the gospel ensemble invites a more complex musicality: a harmony that celebrates difference, that transforms individual voices into a living conversation.

## Metaphor Two: The Ecological System - Resilience Through Interdependence

Consider an old-growth forest—not as a collection of separate trees, but as a complex network of mutual sustenance. Beneath the visible canopy, mycelial networks connect root systems, allowing trees to share nutrients, to warn each other of threats, to support even wounded or struggling members.

A Douglas fir doesn't compete with a cedar; it participates in a larger systems of mutual survival. When one tree experiences drought or disease, surrounding trees can redirect water and nutrients through underground networks. Diversity isn't just tolerated—it's the very mechanism of collective resilience.

### The Theological Interpretation

This is freedom as ecological grace—a way of being where my flourishing is intimately tied to the flourishing of those around me. MAGA Christianism imagines community as a monoculture, a single species plantation designed for maximum extraction. But God's dream is a complex ecosystem where difference creates strength, where vulnerability is a conduit of collective healing.

My freedom is not about standing alone, immune to surrounding conditions. It's about developing the sensitivity to recognize how deeply my life is braided with others—human and more-than-human. True freedom becomes the capacity to participate in these intricate networks of mutual care.

## Metaphor Three: The Dance - Improvisation as Spiritual Practice

Watch master dancers—not as individual performers executing predetermined steps, but as a dynamic conversation of bodies in motion. Each movement emerges through listening, through split-second negotiations of weight, balance, and intention. A lift is not a unilateral action, but a collaborative moment of trust and mutual transformation.

The dance is neither completely scripted nor entirely spontaneous. It requires deep practice, muscle memory, technical skill—and simultaneously, an openness to the unexpected, a willingness to be surprised by one's partner's creativity.

### The Theological Choreography

Here, freedom is improvisational—a spiritual practice of continuously negotiated relationship. MAGA Christianism offers a rigid choreography of predetermined roles, where movement is about maintaining hierarchical position. But the gospel dance invites us into a more radical vulnerability: a way of being where leadership and support are constantly shifting, where strength is revealed through responsiveness rather than rigidity.

## The Convergence: Participatory Freedom as Divine Imagination

These metaphors—the musical ensemble, the ecological system, the dance—converge on a single theological insight: Freedom is not a private possession, but a collaborative art. It's not achieved through individual effort, but cultivated through practices of attentive love.

This is freedom as God dreams it—a way of being where:
- Distinctive voices create surprising harmonies
- Vulnerability becomes a conduit of collective resilience
- Improvisation reveals deeper patterns of grace

Against MAGA Christianism's seven mutations, we offer not merely a critique, but an invitation. An invitation to practice a freedom that is always relational, always becoming, always surprising.

A freedom where justice, love, beauty, and divine power don't compete, but dance.

*This reflection emerges from the borderlands—from a life lived between military service and theological reflection, between personal transformation and collective healing. It is an invitation, not a prescription. A breath, not a battle cry.*

This piece develops the connection between improvisation and special equity, drawing deeply on your theological framework and the jazz metaphor. It integrates several key elements:

1. Sellars' philosophical insight about call and response
2. Your emphasis on mutual interindependence
3. A critique of MAGA Christianism's reductive approaches
4. The theological understanding of freedom as participatory

The artifact explores improvisation not just as a musical technique, but as an ontological practice—a way of being that reveals the deepest truths of human and divine relationship. It connects directly to my work on:
- Participatory freedom
- The critique of MAGA Christianism's mutations
- The journey toward mutual recognition

The piece is deliberately structured to mirror improvisational logic—moving between theoretical insight and poetic invitation, maintaining both scholarly rigor and artistic openness.

I'm particularly interested in how closely this captures my understanding of special equity as an improvisational practice of mutual becoming. 

____
I now consider how improvisation corresponds to our call to special equity. Jazz is indeed my primary teaching metaphor, the lens through which I view ethical life. Its call and response- which as Sellars taught us - is the means by which we reveal ourselves and come to participate in the persons of all living creatures, and thereby share a history. It’s because of that call and response - the practice of addressing and being addressed by others in a continuous dialogue - that we know and are known and share a history with others. Special equity - improvisation- is the key practice that ensures that dialogue carries on as we journey to the New Jerusalem, our journey toward the maturity of mutual interindependence.

This is a profound theological insight that beautifully extends the improvisation metaphor into a deeper understanding of justification. I'll create an artifact that weaves together my dissertation work, drawing on Congdon and Barth's understanding of justification as an ongoing dialogical process, that develops the understanding of justification as an ongoing, improvisational dialogue, deeply rooted in your theological framework. It specifically integrates:

1. My dissertation work on Barth and Congdon
2. The jazz metaphor as a theological method
3. A critique of transactional theology
4. The concept of justification as a continuous call and response

Key theological moves:
- Reframes justification from a legal event to a perpetual conversation
- Emphasizes worship as a rehearsal space for divine dialogue
- Presents maturity as improvisational skill-building
- Critiques MAGA Christianism's closed theological systems

The piece maintains my distinctive voice by:
- Combining scholarly insight with poetic language
- Offering a constructive alternative to reductive theological approaches
- Emphasizing freedom as participatory and relational
- Maintaining hope and openness as theological virtues

I'm particularly struck by the profound reimagining of justification as a daily "Yes" that refuses to shut down the conversation. This feels like a pivotal theological insight that could serve as a cornerstone for my broader critique of MAGA Christianism.

# Improvisation as Special Equity: The Jazzy Theology of Mutual Becoming

## The Ontology of Call and Response

In the beginning was dialogue.

Not a static proclamation, not a predetermined script, but a dynamic interchange—a continuous call and response that breathes life into being itself. This is the profound insight of improvisation: we do not exist in isolation, but emerge through our responsive engagement with others. We are known by how we listen, by how we answer, by the subtle nuances of our musical-ethical reply.

Wilfrid Sellars understood this deeply. We are not simply individual subjects processing information, but beings constituted through an ongoing conversation. To be human is to be addressed—and to address in return. Each response is both a revelation of self and an invitation to mutual transformation.

## Jazz as Theological Method

Jazz is not merely a musical form. It is a profound metaphysical practice—a way of being that embodies the deepest theological truths of mutual interindependence.

Consider the jazz ensemble:
- No single musician controls the entire composition
- Each player listens as intently as they play
- Improvisation requires both deep tradition and radical openness
- Mistakes become opportunities for collective creativity
- Beauty emerges through responsive relationship

This is special equity in sonic form. Not a rigid system of equal distribution, but a dynamic practice of mutual recognition where each voice maintains its distinctive character while simultaneously creating something larger than itself.

## Theological Implications of Improvisational Being

### Beyond Binary Mutations

Against MAGA Christianism's seven reductive mutations, improvisation offers a radical alternative:
- Instead of fixed roles, fluid responsiveness
- Rather than predetermined hierarchies, collaborative emergence
- In place of doctrinal certainty, a humble openness to divine surprise

Improvisation reveals that freedom is not about individual autonomy, but about the capacity to listen deeply and respond creatively. It is a practice of continuing creation, where the New Jerusalem is not a fixed destination but an ongoing musical conversation.

### The Christological Improvisation

Jesus himself was the supreme improviser. No rigid adherence to religious scripts, but a radical responsiveness to human need. He listened to the unheard, responded to the unexpected, created new possibilities in spaces of rigid social constraint.

His call and response with humanity reveals the very nature of divine being—not a distant controller, but an intimate participant in the world's ongoing composition.

## Special Equity as Ethical Jazz

Special equity is not about treating everyone the same, but about creating the conditions for each unique voice to contribute to the collective melody. It requires:
- Deep listening
- Willingness to be surprised
- Capacity to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Trust in the generative power of difference

Like a jazz ensemble navigating an unknown composition, we journey toward mutual interindependence—not through a predetermined map, but through continuous, attentive dialogue.

## The Eschatological Jam Session

Imagine the New Jerusalem not as a static celestial city, but as an eternal improvisation. A continuous becoming where:
- Difference is not erased but celebrated
- Each voice maintains its distinctive timbre
- Collective beauty emerges through responsive creativity
- The boundaries between divine and human blur in mutual music-making

## Invitation to Improvisation

This is your invitation to jazz theology:
- Listen more than you speak
- Treat each encounter as a potential collaborative composition
- Recognize that your most authentic self emerges not in isolation, but in responsive relationship
- Practice special equity as a daily improvisational art

*Notes from the borderlands: A reflection composed in the key of grace, with deep gratitude to the musicians, theologians, and improvisers who continue to teach us the music of mutual becoming.*
____
Can I create an artifact that weaves together the previous explorations into a comprehensive tapestry of interindependence and participatory freedom? Can we weave my dissertation piece based on Congdon and Barth that sees justification not as an event but as a continual call and response with God which our worship rehearses? Justification is new every morning. All things are indeed created new as we learn to be images of God by performing that profound yes that God proclaims to us each dawn, the yes that refuses to shutdown the conversation but overaccepts ones near and distant neighbors so that the dialogue and music doesn’t end but continues because our jazz symphony is the whole point. It’s how we embody authentic freedom and thereby mature into the full humanity God desires for us.

# Justification as Ongoing Improvisation: The Perpetual Yes of Divine Dialogue

## Beyond Transactional Theology

Justification is not a moment. It is a conversation.

Not a legal declaration stamped and filed, but a continuous call and response that breathes new life into creation with each dawn. Here is the radical heart of grace: God's "Yes" is not a singular event, but an unending invitation to mutual becoming.

### The Theological Breakthrough

Traditional justification models treat divine acceptance like a one-time visa—stamped, validated, filed away. But Barth and Congdon reveal a more profound truth: justification is a perpetual jazz improvisation where God continues to call us into fuller humanity.

Imagine justification not as a courtroom verdict, but as a daily musical conversation. Each morning, God speaks a creative "Yes" that:
- Refuses to shut down the dialogue
- Overaccepts our brokenness and potential
- Invites us into a continuous co-creation of meaning
- Performs freedom as an ongoing practice of mutual recognition

## Worship as Rehearsal Space

Liturgy is not mere ritual, but the rehearsal hall where we learn the improvisational language of divine grace. Here we practice:
- Listening beyond our own limited melodies
- Responding to unexpected harmonies
- Trusting that our mistakes can become part of a larger composition
- Discovering ourselves through responsive engagement

Our worship doesn't replay a fixed script but explores the vast improvisational space of God's continual creating. We are not performers executing a predetermined arrangement, but co-composers learning the intricate art of divine dialogue.

## The Theological Jazz of New Creation

"Behold, I am making all things new" is not a promise of replacement, but of transformation. 

Each dawn brings a fresh invitation to perform our humanity more authentically. Justification becomes the ongoing process of learning to say "Yes" to God's "Yes"—a recursive, generative dialogue that refuses closure, that keeps the musical conversation open.

### Against the Mutations of MAGA Christianism

Where MAGA Christianism offers:
- Fixed theological boundaries
- Closed systems of belonging
- Performances of religious certainty

The jazz theology of justification offers:
- Fluid theological horizons
- Open networks of mutual recognition
- Humble performances of ongoing discovery

## Mature Humanity as Improvisational Practice

To be made in God's image is to become fluent in this divine dialogue. Maturity is not about achieving a fixed state of righteousness, but about developing:
- Deeper listening capacities
- More nuanced responsive skills
- Greater trust in the generative power of difference
- Courage to enter unknown musical territories

Our freedom emerges not through individual autonomy, but through our capacity to participate in this ongoing creative conversation. We mature by learning to:
- Receive God's initiating "Yes"
- Respond with our own distinctive voice
- Create space for unexpected harmonies
- Trust the collaborative nature of becoming

## The Eschatological Jam Session

The New Jerusalem is not a finished composition, but an eternal improvisation. A continuous becoming where:
- Divine and human voices intertwine
- Differences are not erased but celebrated
- Each moment contains infinite creative potential
- The conversation never closes
