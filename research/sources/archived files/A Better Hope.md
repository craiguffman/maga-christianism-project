### Highlights

- I have thought the playful use of postmodernism was justified because I have found it difficult to take postmodernism seriously as an intellectual position. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=576))
- we theologians must provide an account of our situation that is at least as radical and imaginative as the one Foucault was attempting. In other words, we must challenge the knowledges currently enshrined in the academic disciplines dominating the modern university. Such knowledges provide the theodical accounts necessary to convince us that the way things are is the way things have to be—which is one of the reasons I have had difficulty taking postmodernism seriously. The problem in brief is that postmodernism is a far too comforting story for alienated intellectuals. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=594))
- Enlightenment project, and surely that is a good thing. Yet I am not convinced that postmodernism, either as an intellectual position or as a cultural style, is post-anything. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=602))
- The Christian difference—why we are not postmodernist—I think is clearly revealed at this point. Christians have a stake in history, ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=609))
- we must show how Christianity provides the resources for a critique of its own mistakes in a way that modernity or postmodernity cannot provide. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=614))
- one of the illusions of postmodernism is to give a far too intelligible and thus comforting account of where we are. Our world and our lives are far too fragmentary and disordered to know where we are, but at least Christians owe it to themselves and their neighbors to confess that such disorder is but a reflection of the failure of the churches to be faithful. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=616))
- Modernity and its bastard offspring postmodernity are but reflections of the Christian attempt to make God a god available without the mediation of the church. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=619))
- Postmodernism, in short, is the outworking of mistakes in Christian theology correlative to the attempt to make Christianity “true” apart from faithful witness. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=621))
- Christians must challenge the postmodern narrative that simply forgets that Christianity had anything to do with the world in which we now find ourselves. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=640))
- It is a question not of getting our historical due as Christians, though that is not entirely irrelevant, but rather of our ability to maintain for ourselves an account of the world in which the God we worship matters. The attempt to make God knowable separate from how God has made himself known through Scripture makes a world without God thinkable. God could not help but become another “thing” amid other metaphysical possibilities. Accordingly, Christians robbed the world of its story. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OW6DWW&location=642))
- Modernity, drawing on the metaphysics of a transcendent god, was the attempt to be historical without Christ. Postmodernity, facing the agony of living in history with no end, is the denial of history.[15] In the wake of such a denial, the only remaining comfort is the shopping mall, which gives us the illusion of creating histories through choice, thus hiding from us the reality that none of us can avoid having our lives determined by money.
