# Reading Notes - Barth, Hauerwas, Burke, Levin

## Sources and Insights for "From First Principles" Project

### 1. **Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology (McCormack)**

This source provides essential theological foundations for understanding Barth's approach, which can counter the primitive biblicism of MAGA Christianism. McCormack's analysis of Barth reveals several key insights relevant to your project:

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Analogia Fidei vs. Analogia Entis**: Barth's concept of the "analogy of faith" offers a powerful alternative to both crude biblicism and natural theology. This is particularly relevant to Part II of your outline. As McCormack writes, Barth insists that "human language in itself has no capacity for bearing adequate witness to God. If human language is nevertheless able to bear witness, it will only be because a capacity not intrinsic to it has been brought to it from without" (Location 322).

2. **The Dialectical Nature of Divine Reality**: Barth emphasizes that divine revelation "is not and never does become the revealedness of God" (Location 3681), which directly counters the primitive biblicist claim to possess unmediated access to divine truth. This connects well with your Chapter 6 on Scripture's Authority.

3. **Eschatological Reservation**: Barth's "eschatological reservation" reminds us that all theological claims are provisional rather than final - a perspective reflected in his sigh "Veni creator Spiritus" which you could use to counter the binary certainty of MAGA Christianism. As McCormack notes, Barth held that "theology can ultimately only take the position of one of those children who have neither bread nor fish, but doubtless a father who has both and will give them these when they ask him" (Location 459).

4. **The Relationality of Theological Truth**: Rather than abstract propositions, Barth understood revelation as relational - "the dialectic of veiling and unveiling" (Location 308) which connects well with your emphasis on the Trinitarian foundation of Christian identity in Chapter 2.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source would be particularly valuable for Chapter 5 ("Ramist Realism Then and Now") in Part II and Chapter 3 ("Knowledge of God") in Part I. McCormack's analysis helps establish that true theological knowledge isn't direct access to propositions but participation in a relationship, which directly counters the primitive biblicism mutation.

### 2. **The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth (Webster)**

This source offers additional perspectives on Barth's theology that can enrich your critique of MAGA Christianism's theological mutations.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Christocentric Focus**: The companion emphasizes Barth's Christocentric approach to all theology: "The Holy Spirit's saving work is also conceived as Christocentric in focus... it is Jesus Christ who constitutes the saving significance of the Holy Spirit in a way that is not true in reverse" (Location 2831). This perspective reinforces your Chapter 10 on "Christ as Supreme Exemplar."

2. **The Reality of Human Freedom**: While MAGA Christianism often reduces freedom to autonomy, Barth understood that true freedom exists in relationship: "The human being is 'opened and related to God Himself'" (Location 2523). This nuanced understanding of freedom as relationship rather than mere non-interference connects to your critique in Part III.

3. **The Social Nature of Humanity**: Barth's understanding of humanity as fundamentally social challenges individualistic political frameworks: "Humanity as co-humanity... [is] the basic form of humanity" (Location 2644). This perspective supports your Chapter 12 on "The Church as Alternative Community."

4. **Eschatological Understanding of Salvation**: The text highlights Barth's distinctive eschatological approach to salvation that resists binary categorization: "That all of this - both His rejection and our election - is... fundamentally an eternal event constitutes a significant shift in Barth's thinking" (Location 2839), which directly addresses your concern with binary apocalypticism in Part IV.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source would strengthen your arguments in Chapter 2 ("The Trinitarian Foundation of Christian Identity"), Chapter 10 ("Christ as Supreme Exemplar"), and Chapter 14 ("Friend/Enemy Distinctions"). Webster's compilation helps demonstrate that orthodox theology doesn't require the binary apocalypticism that characterizes MAGA Christianism.

### 3. **Barth and Rationality (La Montagne & McCormack)**

This source directly addresses how Barth understood the relationship between revelation and human rationality, offering a powerful counter to both primitive biblicism and practical atheism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Critique of Natural Theology**: The text highlights Barth's critique of natural theology: "Natural theology attempts to build up some kind of knowledge of God... from a consideration of the nature of this world... The essence of Barth's complaint is that this is an attempt to achieve the knowledge of God apart from an encounter with the reality of God in action" (Location 3655). This directly connects to your critique of MAGA Christianism's reduction of theology to cultural identity.

2. **The Veiling and Unveiling of God**: Barth's understanding that "God remains hidden even when God reveals God's self, because revelation is the revelation of the God who veils himself when he unveils himself" (Location 3665) challenges the confidence of primitive biblicism that claims direct access to divine truth.

3. **The Critical Realism of Barth's Approach**: The text describes Barth's approach as "critically realistic," meaning he affirms both that "the divine being was real, whole, and complete in itself apart from the knowing activity of the human subject" but that our knowledge of this reality is always mediated (Location 845). This nuanced epistemology challenges both secular and religious dogmatism.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides strong theological foundations for Chapter 3 ("Knowledge of God") and Chapter 6 ("Scripture's Authority Reconsidered"). La Montagne and McCormack's analysis helps establish that Barth's approach represents a more faithful alternative to MAGA Christianism's primitive biblicism while avoiding the relativism often associated with progressive Christianity.

### 4. **The Great Debate (Levin)**

Yuval Levin's analysis of the Burke-Paine debate offers valuable insights into the philosophical and political dynamics that underlie contemporary polarization, including religious nationalism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Nature vs. History**: Levin highlights the fundamental difference between Paine's appeal to abstract natural principles and Burke's emphasis on historical development: "For Paine, nature reveals itself in the form of abstract principles discovered by rational analysis... For Burke, human nature and the rest of nature make themselves known in politics through long experience" (Location 3721-3725). This distinction parallels the difference between primitive biblicism and a more historically-informed hermeneutic.

2. **The Role of Obligations**: Burke's emphasis on unchosen obligations directly challenges contemporary libertarian individualism: "The most essential human obligations and relations—especially those involving the family but also many of those involving community, the nation, and one's religious faith—are not chosen and could never really be chosen" (Location 1960). This perspective connects well with your critique of practical atheism in Part III.

3. **Generational Responsibility**: Levin highlights Burke's understanding of society as "a relationship not just between the living, but also between the living, the dead, and the people of the future" (Location 3906), which offers a counter to the presentism of both MAGA Christianism and secular progressivism.

4. **The Nature of Freedom**: Burke's understanding of liberty as social and ordered - "not solitary, unconnected, individual, selfish liberty" but "social freedom" (Location 2183) - provides a framework for critiquing the libertarian conception of freedom that often characterizes MAGA Christianism.

**Application to Your Project:**

While not explicitly theological, Levin's analysis provides valuable philosophical context for Chapter 7 ("The Priority of the Particular"), Chapter 11 ("Practices vs. Principles"), and Chapter 15 ("Fear of the Other vs. Love of Neighbor"). His account of Burke's conservatism helps distinguish authentic Christian conservatism from the nationalist ideology often associated with MAGA Christianism.

### 5. **Hannah's Child (Hauerwas)** and **The Hauerwas Reader**

Hauerwas's memoir and collected works provide crucial theological perspectives on how Christian formation happens through practices and communities rather than through abstract principles.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Centrality of Practices**: Hauerwas emphasizes that "I had begun to think that ethics was best understood as a form of practical reason" (Location 858), which directly challenges the reduction of Christianity to abstract principles characteristic of MAGA Christianism.

2. **The Critique of Belief-Centered Christianity**: Hauerwas questions the standard focus on belief: "I do not put much stock in 'believing in God.' The grammar of 'belief' invites a far too rationalistic account of what it means to be a Christian" (Location 23). This perspective challenges both primitive biblicism and practical atheism by suggesting that Christianity is not primarily about mental assent to propositions.

3. **The Narrative Character of Christian Ethics**: Hauerwas's emphasis on narrative - "we do not get to make Christianity up" (Location 1936) - provides a powerful counter to both progressive and MAGA distortions of Christian ethics.

4. **Christianity as a Politics**: The Hauerwas Reader emphasizes that early Christianity was not merely private belief but a political reality: "Jesus did not direct attention to himself, but through his teaching, healings, and miracles tried to indicate the nature and immediacy of God's kingdom" (Location 1446). This perspective challenges the practical atheism that separates Christian identity from political practice.

**Application to Your Project:**

Hauerwas's work provides essential theological resources for Chapter 4 ("The Formation of Virtue"), Chapter 10 ("Christ as Supreme Exemplar"), and Chapter 12 ("The Church as Alternative Community"). His emphasis on formation through practices rather than merely through affirming principles directly counters the reduction of Christianity to cultural identity characteristic of MAGA Christianism.

### 6. **Karl Barth and American Evangelicalism (McCormack & Anderson)**

This source addresses the complex relationship between Barth and American evangelicalism, offering insights into why some evangelicals resist Barth's theological contributions.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Question of Universalism**: The text explores Barth's nuanced position on universalism, which many evangelicals find troubling: "There is widespread agreement that one of the most significant 'discoveries' of recent scholarship is that Jesus' teaching was not first of all focused on his own status but on the proclamation of the kingdom of God" (Location 2591). This discussion directly addresses the binary apocalypticism in Part IV of your outline.

2. **The Nature of Divine Election**: McCormack explains Barth's understanding of election: "In Barth's election of Jesus Christ to judgment, death, and the experience of hell to be exhaustive of the meaning of reprobation. 'He is the Rejected, as and because He is the Elect. In view of His election, there is no other rejected but Himself'" (Location 2829). This perspective directly challenges the binary framework that divides humanity into saved and damned.

3. **The Role of Scripture**: The text highlights Barth's approach to scripture as witness rather than proposition: "Jesus Christ, as he is attested for us in Holy Scripture, is the one Word of God which we are to hear, trust and obey in life and in death" (Location 2864). This perspective challenges primitive biblicism while affirming the authority of scripture properly understood.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source would be particularly valuable for Chapter 13 ("Justification Theory and Its Discontents") and Chapter 14 ("Friend/Enemy Distinctions") in Part IV. McCormack and Anderson's analysis helps establish that Barth's approach represents a more faithful alternative to MAGA Christianism's binary apocalypticism while remaining firmly within orthodox Christianity.

### 7. **Knowledge and Faith in Thomas Aquinas (Jenkins)**

This source provides insights into Aquinas's understanding of faith and knowledge that can enrich your critique of primitive biblicism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Nature of Faith**: Jenkins highlights Aquinas's understanding that faith is not primarily intellectual assent but a relationship: "An interesting view of the epistemic evaluation of the assent of faith, or of any voluntary assent, seems implicit in Aquinas's account. He seems to imply that moral virtues and vices, which enable us to act well or poorly in non-epistemic matters, also enable one to act well or poorly in attaining the epistemic goal of believing truths and disbelieving falsehoods" (Location 2931). This perspective challenges the reduction of faith to propositional affirmation.

2. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**: Jenkins explains Aquinas's view that knowledge of God comes through the illumination of the Spirit rather than through natural reason alone: "Through it, a person attains a certain participation in the divine nature" (Location 2188). This perspective challenges both crude biblicism and natural theology.

3. **The Limits of Human Knowing**: Jenkins highlights Aquinas's understanding that "We cannot have scientia of the principles of sacred doctrine in this life, Aquinas clearly states, because we are not capable of a full vision of their truth" (Location 2976). This perspective challenges the confidence of primitive biblicism that claims direct access to divine truth.

**Application to Your Project:**

While focused on Aquinas rather than Barth, this source provides valuable theological perspectives for Chapter 3 ("Knowledge of God") and Chapter 6 ("Scripture's Authority Reconsidered"). Jenkins's analysis helps establish that even the scholastic tradition, often associated with propositionalism, understood faith in relational rather than merely propositional terms.

### 8. **The Bible, Theology, and Faith (Moberly)**

Although your highlights from this source are limited, it touches on the relationship between scripture and Christian faith in ways that could strengthen your critique of primitive biblicism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Nature of Christian Faith**: Moberly emphasizes that "the Christian faith (in all its apparently endless diversity) offers a particular understanding of God and humanity, and a particular way of living, which centres on the figure of Jesus Christ. This faith is rooted in the Bible as a privileged and unique account of the nature of God and humanity and of the significance of Jesus for both" (Location 76). This perspective challenges both secular reductionism and primitive biblicism.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source could provide additional context for Chapter 6 ("Scripture's Authority Reconsidered") in Part II. Moberly's perspective helps establish a nuanced understanding of biblical authority that avoids both liberal reductionism and primitive biblicism.

### 9. **The Cambridge Companion to Hans Urs Von Balthasar**

This source offers theological perspectives on the role of saints in Christian formation, which connects to your chapter on Christ as supreme exemplar.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Saints as Theological Exemplars**: The text emphasizes that "the saints stand at the 'heart of the world'; they set before every generation, in objective and subjective terms, 'a new…" (Location 1288). This perspective reinforces your emphasis on the importance of exemplars in Christian formation.

2. **The Unity of Doctrine and Life**: The companion emphasizes that "just as the unity of the trinitarian persons are constituted through their mutual indwelling (circuminsessio) of love, and just as Jesus' humanity is to come to full existence as he enacts to the end the obedience of filial love, so too the…" (Location 1411). This perspective challenges the practical atheism that separates Christian identity from Christian practice.

3. **Eschatological Understanding of Salvation**: The text highlights Balthasar's nuanced approach to universal salvation: "it is not entirely clear that Paul ever had a 'two group eschatology,'" (Location 2742), which directly addresses your concern with binary apocalypticism in Part IV.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides theological resources for Chapter 10 ("Christ as Supreme Exemplar") and Chapter 13 ("Justification Theory and Its Discontents"). Balthasar's theology offers a more nuanced understanding of salvation and sanctification that counters the binary thinking of MAGA Christianism.

### 10. **The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas (Kretzmann & Stump)**

This source provides insights into Aquinas's understanding of analogy and participation that can enrich your critique of both primitive biblicism and practical atheism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Analogical Nature of Theological Language**: The text explains Aquinas's understanding that "our language about God is necessarily analogical, which means that theology has the task of helping the church not say more about God than needs to be said" (Location 779). This perspective challenges the confidence of primitive biblicism that claims direct access to divine truth.

2. **The Participatory Nature of Creation**: The companion highlights Aquinas's understanding that "when something receives particularly that which belongs to another universally (or totally), the former is said to participate in the latter" (Location 1255). This participatory ontology challenges both secular naturalism and the practical atheism that separates Christian identity from Christian practice.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides theological foundations for Chapter 3 ("Knowledge of God") and Chapter 10 ("Christ as Supreme Exemplar"). Aquinas's understanding of analogy and participation offers a more nuanced theological framework than the propositionalism that often characterizes MAGA Christianism.

### 11. **Orthodox and Modern (McCormack)**

This source directly addresses the relationship between orthodoxy and modernity, offering valuable perspectives on how to be faithful to Christian tradition while engaging contemporary challenges.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Nature of Orthodoxy**: McCormack emphasizes that "even the ecumenical creeds are only provisional statements. They are only relatively binding as definitions of what constitutes 'orthodoxy'" (Location 108). This perspective challenges both liberal relativism and fundamentalist propositionalism.

2. **The Role of Historical Consciousness**: McCormack identifies historical consciousness - "the awareness that all human thinking is conditioned by historical (and cultural) location" - as central to modern theology (Location 41). This perspective challenges the ahistorical reading of scripture characteristic of primitive biblicism.

3. **Critiquing the "Two Source" Theory**: McCormack cites Barth's critique of German Christians who "[assert] that, next to Holy Scripture as the sole source of revelation, the German nation (Volk), its history and its contemporary politics, constitute a second source of revelation" (Location 691). This directly connects to your critique of MAGA Christianism's nationalism.

4. **Theological Method**: McCormack highlights Schleiermacher's insight that theological method must be contextual: "In order to say the same thing that had once been said, it had to be said in a new way" (Location 536). This perspective challenges both liberal relativism and fundamentalist propositionalism.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides valuable perspectives for your overall framework, particularly the introduction and Chapter 1 ("Introducing the Crisis of MAGA Christianism"). McCormack's analysis helps establish that being orthodox and modern isn't a contradiction - one can be faithful to Christian tradition while engaging contemporary challenges in contextually appropriate ways.

### 12. **The Art of Reading Scripture (Davis & Hays)**

This source offers perspectives on the interpretation of scripture that can enrich your critique of primitive biblicism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The Church as Interpretive Community**: The text emphasizes that "we, the church, are within Scripture — that is, our common life is located inside the story Scripture tells" (Location 769). This perspective challenges the individualism of primitive biblicism.

2. **The Narrative Character of Scripture**: The text suggests that "Scripture constrains our lives and thinking the way a play or novel constrains the lives and thinking of the characters" (Location 817). This narrative understanding challenges the propositionalism of primitive biblicism.

3. **The Christological Center of Scripture**: The text proposes that time in biblical narrative is "neither linear nor cyclical but perhaps more like a helix, and what it spirals around is the risen Christ" (Location 875). This perspective reinforces your emphasis on the Christological center of scripture in Chapter 6.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides valuable perspectives for Chapter 6 ("Scripture's Authority Reconsidered") and Chapter 8 ("Appeals to Timeless Absolutes"). Davis and Hays's analysis helps establish a more nuanced understanding of biblical interpretation that avoids both liberal reductionism and primitive biblicism.

### 13. **The Barmen Theses Then and Now (Busch)**

This source directly addresses the relationship between Christianity and nationalism, offering valuable historical precedent for your critique of MAGA Christianism.

**Key Insights:**

1. **The First Barmen Thesis**: The text emphasizes that "Jesus Christ, as he is attested for us in Holy Scripture, is the one Word of God which we have to hear and which we have to trust and obey in life and in death" (Location 487). This directly challenges any nationalism that would make the nation a secondary source of revelation.

2. **The Duty of Confession**: Busch highlights that "confession means to witness anew to the gospel of Jesus Christ in view of…" (Location 176). This perspective challenges the reduction of Christianity to cultural identity without prophetic witness.

3. **The Second Barmen Thesis**: The document states that "assurance of the forgiveness of all our sins" and "God's mighty claim" are inseparable (Location 806-807). This unity challenges the practical atheism that separates Christian identity from Christian practice.

4. **Christian Freedom**: The text articulates that true Christian freedom is "a liberty connected with order: that not only exists along with order and virtue but which cannot exist at all without them" (Location 2213). This understanding challenges both secular libertarianism and the reduction of freedom to autonomy.

**Application to Your Project:**

This source provides historical precedent for your critique of MAGA Christianism, particularly in Chapter 1 ("Introducing the Crisis of MAGA Christianism") and Chapter 9 ("Reinhold Niebuhr and American Pragmatism"). The Barmen Declaration represents a historical instance of the church resisting nationalist co-option, which directly parallels your critique of MAGA Christianism.

## Synthesis and Roadmap

These sources collectively provide strong theological foundations for your critique of MAGA Christianism's three mutations: primitive biblicism, practical atheism, and binary apocalypticism.

For **primitive biblicism**, Barth's concepts of the analogia fidei and the dialectic of veiling and unveiling offer powerful alternatives to both crude biblicism and natural theology. These sources help establish that Christian knowledge is always mediated through relationship rather than direct access to propositions.

For **practical atheism**, Hauerwas's emphasis on formation through practices and his critique of Niebuhr's Christian Realism offer powerful alternatives to the reduction of Christianity to cultural identity. These sources help establish that Christian identity necessarily entails Christian practice.

For **binary apocalypticism**, Barth's and Balthasar's nuanced approaches to salvation challenge the friend/enemy distinctions that characterize MAGA Christianism. These sources help establish that Christian apocalyptic properly understood points toward reconciliation rather than binary opposition.

The historical precedent of the Barmen Declaration provides a powerful example of the church resisting nationalist co-option, which directly parallels your critique of MAGA Christianism.

Moving forward, I recommend:

1. Incorporating Barth's concept of the analogia fidei more explicitly in Chapter 6 ("Scripture's Authority Reconsidered")
2. Using Hauerwas's critique of Niebuhr more extensively in Chapter 9 ("Reinhold Niebuhr and American Pragmatism")
3. Drawing on the Barmen Declaration more directly in Chapter 1 ("Introducing the Crisis of MAGA Christianism")
4. Incorporating Levin's analysis of Burke and Paine to provide philosophical context for your theological critique

These theological resources will help establish that your critique of MAGA Christianism emerges not from progressive theology but from orthoroxy properly understood.
