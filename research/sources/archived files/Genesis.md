### Highlights

- Irenaeus, Origen, and the great cloud of premodern biblical interpreters assumed that puzzling out the mosaic of Scripture must be a communal project. The Bible is vast, heterogeneous, full of confusing passages and obscure words, and difficult to understand. Only a fool would imagine that he or she could work out solutions alone. The way forward must rely upon a tradition of reading that Irenaeus reports has been passed on as the rule or canon of truth that functions as a confession of faith. `Anyone," he says, "who keeps unchangeable in himself the rule of truth received through baptism will recognize the names and sayings and parables of the scriptures."2 ([Location 27](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=27))
- The covenant with Israel, the coming of Christ, the gathering of the nations into the church-all these things are gathered up into the rule of faith, and they guide the vision and form of the soul toward the end of fellowship with God. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=50))
- passages that implicitly comment on Gen. 3:1. As the larger tradition affirms again and again, evil and the possibility of transgression begins with the angels. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1093))

- On the contrary, the idea of a fallen angel helps biblical readers of Gen. 3 in two ways. First, a reference to Satan immediately conjures a cosmoswide power, and this helps dramatize the cosmoswide scope of the divine plan and the sinful resistance to it. Second, the concept of the devil serves as a placeholder for the most extreme possible negation of the divine plan that is consistent with the belief that God is the all-powerful and all-good creator of everything out of nothing.

- if we assume that the serpent is not just a particular animal in the garden of paradise, but is instead a grand spiritual being who has already embarked on the deepest and widest possible rebellion against God, then at the very least we have succeeded in reframing a quite intimate and concrete story of temptation in Gen. 3 within a cosmic context. What the serpent says is not just a localized event. Recourseto the devil inflates the significance of the events.

- When 1 Pet. 5:8 warns that "the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour," the effect is not to conjure up pictures of a trident-carrying, horned creature with cloven hoofs.

- Gen. 3, we learn something about the large biblical vision of human freedom. Although our actions are free and we genuinely shape the directions of our lives, we do not define the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which we live. As any mention of the devil reminds us, we are cast into a world already shaped by a creationwide history of resistance to the divine plan. Our freedom is not pristine,… ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1129))

- no aspect of creation other than freedom itself is implicated as the reason for an angelic fall. The devil falls strictly because of his choice and not because of any other feature or quality of the created order. This allows us to say that the first transgression, the fall of the devil, occurs in creation, but not because of creation. "It was," writes St. Augustine, "an evil… ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1158))

- we need no longer presume that created goods trigger the first human sin. Instead, Satan's prior, purely spiritual, and self-directing choice influences Eve's subsequent, embodied, and responsive choice. She is not thrown off balance by anything God has created. Her transgression turns on her response to a prior form of evil that is, in itself, an act of finite but pure freedom. Of course, Adam's sin has precisely the same form.… ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1164))

- The perverted human will follows false gods, false leaders, and false promises, all the while imagining them to be the source of life.This view of human freedom as a decision about whom to obey finds ample confirmation in everyday life. We cannot follow our instincts, but we can follow the idea of following our instincts. We cannot live as natural men and women, but we can follow a philosophy of natural existence. We cannot live only for ourselves, but we can adopt the principle of egoism. By St. Paul's analysis, in sin we pervert rather than undo or destroy the purposes for which human nature was created. We live a distorted facsimile of covenant. We are "slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe" (Gal. 4:3). We were created to know and worship the living God, but in our blindness we serve dead idols (Rom. 1:21-23). ([Location 1192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1192))

- But his distance from God is not the same as actual sin. It waits upon his decision. The same holds for all who inherit the legacy of exile. Because we are born as children of Adam, the momentum of our lives is away from God. Left to ourselves we choose always to believe the lie that we can live on bread alone, and with this choice, we enter into our inheritance with actual sin.

- With Cain, God intervenes and gives counsel: in effect, "Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil" (Eph. 4:26-27).

- Augustine ends up following the larger Pauline insight: God's election-in this case the divine favor shown to Abel-precipitates sin. Although Augustine does not pursue the connection of Cain's sin to later brotherly enmity in Genesis, the notion that sin is stirred up by God's initiative anticipates a major theme of the later chapters of Genesis. Cain is angry about the LORD'S preference for Abel, and he rebels against the divine plan that "the elder shall serve the younger" (Gen. 25:23).

- What we experience as evil, therefore, must be defined only over and against created goodness. It is a diminishment or privation of goodness. And this is precisely the narrative logic of Cain's murder of Abel.

- A great deal of modern humanism encourages us to overcome our religious fantasies and affirm the finite world of flesh and blood as our true inheritance. Instead of pining for the transcendent, we should be loyal to the present. Instead of trying to be citizens of heaven, we should be happy with our citizenship in this world.

- The problem, however, is that we cannot settle down into the city of Enoch or any earthly city. Because the human creature is created for the future of fellowship with God, we are amphibious and we cannot rest in the world. We cannot find lasting rest in human projects, whether amassing wealth or assuming power or satisfying passions and desires or any other worldly endeavor. Libertines will groan in their overindulgence-or take to the streets to protest against the repressions of society that they imagine still limit them and deny them the rest they seek. Our age is full of fugitives and wanderers, resolute in their loyalty to the earthly city as they pant and strain for more. Even being normal and well adjusted becomes ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1612))
- Where Adam and Eve eat, Cain murders. Where Cain murders and then pleads with God for mercy, Lamech murders and then boasts of his deadly anger: "I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me" (4:23). Lamech's voice brags about rather than laments his fate: "If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech is avenged seventy-sevenfold"(4:24). "Hah, Lamech says, "Cain killed his brother in a fit of anger, but I've killed a young man simply because he inconvenienced me, simply because he offended my honor, and unlike Cain I'm man enough to face my future." Like the frenzied crowd in Jerusalem who cry "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Lamech embraces the covenant of Satan's lie. The crazy, impossible dream of countermanding the divine plan that began with a tasty fruit and the promise of life now spirals toward a forthright lust for death. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1638))
- This new genesis, coming after the descent of Cain's line into the pit of death, evokes the possibility of new future, one not implicated in the first transgression. It is as if the incoming tide of sin has so flooded the human condition that a new beginning must be made. And in this genealogy, tellingly, Cain and his progeny are excluded. The future evoked seems to bend away from the trajectory of sin. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1645))
- God's plan does not involve a radical reengineering of human life after the fashion of one of Stalin's five-year plans, nor does it depend upon a method of therapeutic reconciliation that puts bad experiences behind us. The remote and timeless hand of God does not press an automatic reset button. Instead, with the calling of Abraham in Gen. 12, God does not start the human race over again. Abraham is not a new genesis.… ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1662))
- Both Protestants and Catholics largely followed the general lines of the intracanonical interpretation of Enoch.

- The fathers at the Council of Trent endorsed the human capacity to perform meritorious works (always, of course, made possible only by the prevenient grace of God), while the Reformers pointed to faith (also always made possible only by the prevenient grace of God) as the sine qua non of a life pleasing to God. I cannot pretend to resolve this debate, which in spite of important ecumenical statements that underline essential compatibilities remains very much alive in the culture of contemporary Christianity. But it is important to see the underlying consensus that was always present. Here and now, and even in the most inauspicious circumstances, a life pleasing to God is possible. The affirmation is especially important today, because a desire to blend into modern post-Christian… ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1683))
- The trajectory from "sons of God" to "daughters of men" symbolizes the decline of history into a singular focus on physical life as the end or purpose of human striving. With this approach we can gloss God's judgment that he will not "abide in man for ever, for he is flesh" (6:3) in the following way: "I will not abide in man, for he has become entirely a slave of the flesh." For as Paul observes, "The mind… ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1692))
- The flood story begins with emphasis on the disaster of sin: "Do not be mismatched," warns Paul, "for what partnership have righteousness and iniquity?" (2 Cor. 6:14). The mismatching began with Adam and Eve. They did not marry their wills to God's purpose for creation; instead, they turned and wed themselves to the lie that worldly goods are the highest good. Just as wrongful eating becomes wrongful killing in Cain, once again Genesis emphasizes a trajectory of intensified consequences as the genealogy of Seth heads toward disaster. "The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth," and there was "only evil continually" (Gen. 6:5). It is Lamech all over again (-4:23). The descendants of Adam and Eve live in "a covenant with death" (Isa. 28:15). "Theearth was filled with… ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1696))

We should not confuse human activity with human independence: "Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain" (Ps. 127:1). At no point does the narrative suggest any controlling factor in Noah's life other than God's initiative.

- The waters of the deep that flood the earth signify the primal vitality of biological life, which has no future in itself, but only the endless cycles of birth and death. They are the primal, undifferentiated waters first separated and ordered on the second day of creation (Gen. 1:6-8). In contrast, the water of life that comes from the throne of God and the Lamb signify the refreshment of the Sabbath rest of the seventh day. It is the life-giving water of the… ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1746))
- A spiritual sense also follows the pattern of fitting punishment. To inundate sinners with the natural elements is to fulfill the desire of Adam and Eve to rest in finite things. God does not pour out an alien wrath or muster an invading force. He opens the floodgates of our desire for things of the earth. The flood is what happens when the decision of Adam and Eve is given free reign. We drown in the consummation of our finite loves. The soul that desires pleasures of food and drink becomes bloated and bursts. Envy finds perverse pleasure in implacable grudges. Anger burns and overflows. Greed piles up… ([Location 1749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1749))

- Wisdom of Solomon also refers to the Noah story, treating it as pregnant with significance for our efforts to find safe passage through the trials of temptation: "For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by thy hand left to the world the seed of a new… ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1757))
- A Christian reader needs no great literary imagination to link the savingwood of the ark with the saving wood of the cross and the body of Christ on the cross to the body of Christ that is the church.

- God runs the administration of worldly affairs to remedy the fall and return humanity to the possibility of entering into his Sabbath rest. The divinely ordained administration is rationally run; that is, it functions according to a logos or plan. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1783))
- "As in the days of Noah," says Jesus of his own coming passion, "so will it be in the days of the Son of man. They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all" (Luke 17:26-27; Matt. 24:37-39). As the gospel story unfolds, the pattern of the flood is recapitulated in Christ. On the cross, the flood of divine judgment destroys the power of sin, and in the tomb the Son endures solely by the will of the Father. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1792))
- God's goal of returning creation to the trajectory toward Sabbath rest is universal in scope. All things are to be brought to fulfillment. But the plan is intensely focused and particular in execution. The fulfillment comes through a narrow gate. With this future in mind, we can see how the flood story both retells and alters the original creation story. The primal waters return in the flood, and the world reverts back to its original, undifferentiated state. ([Location 1825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1825))
- The flood does not destroy or wipe creation clean so that God can undertake a broad refurbishment of the cosmos as a contractor might gut and then restore a dilapidated house. Instead, the flood holds up the ark. The tiny vessel carries forward the human future: creation is renewed two by two, anticipating the time when "one man's act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men" (Rom. 5:18).

- Furthermore, as the use of forty days (or years) throughout scripture suggests, the rains sent by God last for the standard period for purgation and purification: "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow" (Ps. 51:7). This link between purgative destruction and salvation culminates in the saving death of Jesus Christ. Written in a context of persecution, the author of 1 Peter describes the trials of the faithful as tests of fire that purify the soul (1 Pet. 1:7, 22). In these trials, the suffering of Christ serves as an example (2:21). He is the one who, "when he was reviled.... did not revile in return" (2:23). The application is clear: the faithful are to… ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1841))
- Christ and the church are the ark into which the faithful are incorporated. The author if 1 Peter presumes this shift: "Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you" (3:21)-although this assertion of allegorical correspondence is itself complex and plays across different aspects of Noah's story.

- The earth may have been cleansed by water, but the inhabitants of the ark are untouched. They still need to be purified by divine righteousness, which takes the form of new commandments given and old ones reiterated. A very different flood is necessary: "May my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distil as the dew, as the… ([Location 1864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1864))
- Aside from the ark, the flood story has all the features of decreation and a return to the beginning of creation. Yet the ark would seem to be the main point, and it introduces the dominant pattern in the rest of scripture: "For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you" (Isa. 54:7). ([Location 1897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1897))
- Floods of trial, slavery, exile, persecution, and even the flood of death on the cross-all these winnowing and purging episodes of suffering are for the sake of finding our way into the future of fellowship with God. In this sense, the flood sets out patterns of divine loyalty to his creatures: "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it" (Song 8:7). ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=1899))
- This human-centered change is mirrored in the divine-centered promise neveragain to unleash the primal forces of nature against humanity. Water will return as a remedy for sin in the history of the covenant, but it will be the irrigating, life-giving water of Gen. 2 rather than the primal waters of Gen. 1 that overwhelm the world in Gen. 7: "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses" (Ezek. 36:2 5). Looking back on the flood episode, therefore, we can see that the massive project of worldwide cleansing does not create a new future for humanity. It hits the pause button on the doleful, destructive thrust of sin and brings a modicum of stability to human history.

- The fall of Adam and Eve is primordial, and this raises an expectation in the readers of Genesis that God's remedy will also be worked out against the same background of universality. If all of humanity has been implicated in the covenant of the lie that we can live by bread alone, then wouldn't it stand to reason that the divine plan should deal with humanity at the same level of inclusive generality? Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, the sons of God and daughters of men, the global flood, the tower of Babel-these figures and events have the timeless, archetypical feel of myth or legend. The literary forms are diverse, but one feels an expansive frame of reference and a general relevance: the first family, the first sin, the first murder, the first city. Shouldn't Genesis continue in this manner? Shouldn't this book of origins provide a broad outline of God's remedy to match the universality of the problem of sin?

- From Gen. 12 onward, Genesis is concerned with one household, a tinyportion of humanity that would be otherwise invisible-indeed, uninteresting-to anyone whose religious categories and concepts had been formed solely by the grand account of creation in Gen. 1.This change in atmosphere from Gen. 1-11 is one of the single most important moments in the Bible. Because Christian theology has inherited its conceptual vocabulary from Greek thought, there has been a perennial temptation to treat universality as opposed to particularity, and eternity as antithetical to time. But these contrasting terms, which are so central to the commonsense metaphysical intuitions that we all tend to have, will not help us read Genesis-and they certainly will not help us think clearly about the God who comes to us in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.

- The cleansing of the world by way of the flood only stabilizes the effects of sin rather than washes away its stain. Only now, with a shift of focus from the global and universal to the narrowly tribal and particular, does the Bible reveal the true nature of redemption. God's plan is universal in scope-it sets about to redeem the entire cosmos-but the plan is not universal in method or means. Abraham, a particular head of a particular household, is called to live in aparticular way, in a particular place. The divine plan injects a new possibility into the flow of history rather than acting over or upon humanity from the outside. Therefore, if we seek deliverance, we are not to appeal to God's timeless universality, nor should we imagine that God saves by way of some sort of direct application of his metaphysical properties, as if we were sipping the nectar of eternity from the cup of… ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2063))
- Abraham is important because God's covenant with him quite simply is the divine plan. The full force of the is, which we cannot evade with terms such as represents or symbolizes or mediates, runs against the grain of our mental habits. To say that the calling of Abraham is God's plan means this. What God has promised in his covenant with Abraham and done to secure its fulfillment leads us to fuller knowledge of who God is, rather than the other way around. "Thus says… ([Location 2072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2072))
- The extraordinary and unexpected shift in focus from universal to particular is the clearest way in which the Old Testament prefigures the fulfillment of the divine plan in Jesus Christ. In Abraham, God does something he does not do with Abel or with Seth or with Enoch or with Noah. The particularity of Abraham-he matters for the sake of the whole world-prepares us for the claim that the salvation of all rests on the death and resurrection of Jesus. Therefore, it is not possible to overemphasize 12:1. It is the beginning of the gospel. And this gospel commits us to what our inherited traditions… ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2082))

- How can God break the hold of this past over our future? At root, the power of sin rests in Satan's promise in the garden: If you eat, you will not die-you can have what you want and enjoy it as the eternal end or purpose of your life. It is a covenant based on a lie: you can find your heart's desire by satisfying your desires for the things of this world. We all know the extraordinary power of this false promise, which like all convenient, self-serving beliefs has an ability to charm us into thinking that it must be true. Because it is a claim about the future rather than a present thing or reality, it cannot be isolated, examined, and destroyed by its contradiction to reality. Hope springs eternal, and even aging baby boomers sustain the vain hope that they can stay forever young. Thus, the power of the false promise cannot be defused by cool reason. It must be overcome by a counter-promise, a different claim about the future, a different covenant.… ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2097))

- Abraham's leave-taking is not simply a personal or interior departure. The divine plan is not secret, nor does it work in the privacy of the human heart. The tear in history is communal and public. In the generations between Noah and Abraham, an undifferentiated mass of humanity settled on a plain in the land of Shinar, and they tried to form a great city to make a name for themselves (-11:4). Now God promises to give Abraham-in-particular what humanity-in-general sought to achieve by… ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2114))

- In the promise to Abraham, we can see the divine fulfillment of our presently deformed desires for place, nation, and immortality. The original garden provided a place, and human beings rightly desire a homeland. The same holds for a nation. Patriotic impulses, nationalisms, tribal loyalties, family pride-all these drives toward collective greatness emerge from the original condition of our humanity.

- Thus, the drama of redemption is neither a story of changing personalities, moving from Abraham to Moses to Jesus as a varied gallery of religious figures, nor one that shifts from law to gospel. The drama of redemption is the story of scripture as a whole, and the main plot is about how God adds more and more weight to the single history begun in Abraham. To use a term from patristic theology, scripture and the history it tells recapitulate rather than supersede or advance by way of changed focus or changed theme. Abraham's departure from the household of his father is… ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0036SGPLG&location=2144))

- God's appearances to Abraham are not simply reiterative. They have an ascending logic. First, Abraham is called by the promises (12:1-3). The promises create the possibility of a new future and break the hold of the covenant of the lie. Then, in the second divine appearance, Abraham is told to walk within the land of the promise (13:14-18). The new future is not just hypothetical. With the eyes of faith, it can be seen as a real possibility. Next, the covenant is announced (15:1-21), and a vision of God's mighty deeds in the future serves as a down payment on the fulfillment of the promise. In the fourth appearance, the focus shifts. Abraham has walked the land, and now he is directed to walk in the covenant. The promises give a new future. In order to inhabit those promises, Abraham must change. He must become a different kind of man, one fit not only to walk in the land, but also to walk before the LORD. He must be altered in his flesh beginning with the act of circumcision.

- For this reason, Gen. 17 is the second great hinge on which Genesis turns. Genesis 12 reveals the metaphysical heresy of the divine investment in a particular clan. God will use a particular people, time, and place to achieve his universal plan of drawing all creation into his Sabbath rest. Now we find out how God will use particularity. As echoes throughout the Old Testament make clear, God will shape the plasticity of the human creature. He commands, and we have the power toobey and, in obeying, to become different (-2:17). The way forward is thus set: "You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you" (lieut. 5:33). This will not only provide a remedy for sin, but will also serve as a means for the sanctification of human life. To walk in the ways of the LORD is to partake in his will, and by doing so our humanity is formed according to God's purposes.

- For many modern readers, the idea that God tries and tests the faithful offends. We tend to think of loving parents as those who protect rather than try. A good teacher seeks to empower rather than test. We worry about the perils of competition. Encouraging self-esteem becomes the great preoccupation. Everybody is a winner, and prizes and ribbons are on hand for all the participants. True love nurtures, we imagine; it does not challenge and demand, try and judge.

- However the scriptures testify otherwise. The trials of Israel in the wilderness are described as the LoRD's test, designed to humble the proud independence of Israel and renew covenant faithfulness (lieut. 8:11-20). These trials are ongoing in the biblical history of Israel, always against the background of the threatening perversions of idolatry. After the conquest of the land, the LORD does not permit full and complete dominion. Alien peoples and their strange gods remain, but not as the stubborn residue of the past. Instead they are divinely ordained temptations: "That by them," says the LORD, "I may test Israel, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not" (Judg. 2:22). Later, after their descent into idolatry and division under the ill-fated kings of Israel and Judah, the LORD tries his faithless people with the afflictions of exile (Jer. 9:7). The tribulations of captivity foreshadow an eschatological trial. At the end of the age, the LORD will set aside a remnant, and he will "refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested" (Zech. 13:9).
