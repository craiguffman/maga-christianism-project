I'd be happy to rewrite Chapter 4 of your dissertation for a 2025 audience of MAGA Christianists, adapting Hooker's arguments against Ramist biblicism to challenge modern biblical literalism. I'll use Hooker's rhetorical approach while updating the examples to be relevant to today's context.

# Participation as Fellowship: A Theological Response to Biblical Literalism

## Introduction

Many today claim the Bible presents itself as the sole and sufficient source of all knowledge Christians need. In the words of the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978), Scripture is "of infallible divine authority in all matters upon which it touches" and "the very Word of God." But is there an objective ground for this claim? Is there a connection between such cognitive commitments and the formation of communities that actually embody the mind of Christ? How do communities that claim to follow Christ reliably discern the good?

These questions take us into theological territory requiring careful attention. I will argue that the Holy Spirit actuates a reciprocal knowing of and responsiveness to Christ mediated by a sociality, an interactivity, and a history of shared life—all of which are constituted by a restored rationality. Such fellowship, rather than merely a text interpreted in isolation, provides the epistemic ground of our ethical reasoning.

## The False Promise of Direct Knowledge

The key question is not whether Scripture is authoritative—on this all Christians agree—but whether human beings can access Scripture's meaning directly, without mediation through tradition, community, and the Holy Spirit's ongoing work. The claim of direct access to biblical meaning is what Richard Hooker called "primitive biblicism" when addressing the Ramist Puritans of his day. Today's version of this claim is no less problematic.

Consider the absurdity of the position: if Scripture alone provides all necessary knowledge, why do we need seminaries? Why do pastors spend years studying ancient languages and historical contexts? Why do you turn to commentaries when preparing sermons? The very existence of your extensive study tools contradicts your stated position.

When you claim, "The Bible says..." as though its meaning were self-evident, you imply that you alone have accessed the plain, obvious meaning that has somehow eluded millions of devout believers across twenty centuries. This is not humility but extraordinary presumption.

## The Impossibility of Direct Knowledge

Hooker recognized that all human knowledge is necessarily mediated. We are not angels with direct access to divine understanding. We are creatures with minds shaped by language, culture, history, and community. Even our ability to read Scripture depends on these mediations.

"But the text is clear!" you might protest. Consider this challenge: take ten committed biblical literalists, place them in separate rooms with the same biblical passage, and ask them to explain its meaning. Will they produce identical interpretations? The evidence of church history suggests otherwise.

Even something as seemingly straightforward as Jesus' command "Do this in remembrance of me" has produced radically different sacramental theologies among equally committed Bible-believing Christians. Why? Because interpretation always involves mediation.

## The Personal Nature of True Knowledge

What Hooker recognized, and what we must recover, is that true theological knowledge is not abstract but personal. We do not merely know about Christ; we know Christ. And this knowledge, this personal relationship, is mediated through the Holy Spirit working within the community of believers across time and space.

When modern Christians claim they need only "me and my Bible," they fundamentally misunderstand how Christian knowledge works. The Bible itself never makes such a claim. Rather, it consistently points to knowledge as participation in Christ through the Spirit-filled community.

## The Church as the Context of Knowledge

The individualism of modern biblical literalism would have been incomprehensible to the apostles. When Paul wrote to the Corinthians about spiritual discernment, he addressed not isolated individuals each interpreting Scripture alone, but a community learning to discern together the mind of Christ.

Consider how you yourself came to faith. Was it through reading the Bible in isolation? Or was it through the testimony, teaching, and lived example of other believers? Your own faith journey demonstrates the communal nature of Christian knowledge.

The Bible itself came to us through community—written, compiled, preserved, and transmitted by the Church. To claim direct access to its meaning apart from this community is not to honor Scripture but to misunderstand its very nature.

## The Spirit's Work in Community

Hooker understood what many today forget: the same Spirit who inspired Scripture continues to work in the community of believers to illuminate its meaning. This is not to suggest new revelation that contradicts Scripture, but to recognize that understanding Scripture is itself a spiritual work that happens in community.

When you insist on your interpretation as the only possible reading of a text, you're not actually elevating Scripture—you're elevating your own understanding above the collective wisdom of the Church. This is precisely the error Hooker identified in the Ramist approach.

## The Test of Experience

If your approach to Scripture were truly sufficient, we would expect to see its fruit in communities that embody Christ's character. Yet what we often observe instead are fragmentation, judgment, and an inability to maintain unity even among those who claim the same literal approach to the Bible.

Meanwhile, communities that embrace a richer understanding of how the Spirit works through Scripture, tradition, and reason often manifest greater fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

## Conclusion

The path forward is not to abandon Scripture's authority but to recover a properly theological understanding of how that authority functions within the community of believers led by the Spirit. True knowledge of God comes not through isolated study of texts, but through participation in Christ mediated by the Spirit working in and through the communion of saints.

As Hooker might say to today's biblical literalists: "Your error lies not in elevating Scripture too highly, but in elevating your own understanding too confidently, and in diminishing the ongoing work of the Spirit in the community Christ established."

The question is not whether Scripture is God's Word—on this we agree—but whether any individual can claim direct, unmediated access to its meaning apart from the community and tradition that delivered it to us in the first place. The humbler and more theologically sound position is to recognize our dependence on the Spirit working through the community of faith across time and space.
