# Near and Distant Neighbors: Christian Duties in a Divided World

## Introduction: The Theological Stakes of Proximity

The question of what Christians owe to those near and distant carries profound theological implications in our fractured age. MAGA Christianism has resolved this question by prioritizing obligations to the near—family, church, and nation—in ways that effectively nullify duties to the distant. This resolution betrays a fundamental distortion of the Christian tradition. As Barth powerfully articulates, "persons who are really in their own people, among those near them, are always on the way to those more distant, those other peoples." Proximity, in other words, never provides an excuse for insularity but rather serves as a starting point for an outward journey.

The question before us is not whether to prioritize the near or the distant, but how these duties relate to one another within a coherent theological vision. This exploration reveals that MAGA Christianism's resolution of this tension represents not merely a political position but a theological mutation that distorts the Christian understanding of community, obligation, and divine command.

## I. Biblical Frameworks: Beyond the Good Samaritan

### A. Levitical Foundations

The question of what we owe our neighbors finds its most explicit biblical treatment in Leviticus 19:18: "Love your neighbor as yourself." This command appears in a context of concrete economic and social practices: leaving gleanings for the poor, rendering impartial judgment, paying fair wages. From the outset, neighbor-love is not merely an affective disposition but a practical orientation that shapes economic and social relationships.

Yet the question "Who is my neighbor?" has always been contested. The lawyer who poses this question to Jesus in Luke 10:29 seeks to "justify himself" by drawing boundaries around the obligation. Jesus responds with the parable of the Good Samaritan, deliberately choosing a religious and ethnic outsider as his exemplar of neighbor-love. The point is inescapable: the category of "neighbor" transcends religious, ethnic, and national boundaries.

### B. The Universal and the Particular in Pauline Thought

Paul navigates the tension between universal obligation and particular responsibility in Galatians 6:10: "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers." This "especially" (μάλιστα) acknowledges the reality of limited resources and relationships without nullifying the universal scope of Christian responsibility.

Similarly, in 1 Timothy 5:8, Paul insists that "anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever." This prioritization of family obligations might seem to support MAGA Christianism's emphasis on the near. Yet Paul's letters consistently challenge ethnic, social, and gender boundaries within the church (Galatians 3:28) and call for solidarity with those suffering throughout the world (1 Corinthians 12:26).

### C. The Neighbor in the Kingdom Vision

Jesus's kingdom proclamation transforms our understanding of nearness and distance. In Mark 3:31-35, when told his mother and brothers are outside looking for him, Jesus responds: "Who are my mother and my brothers?... Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother." This radical redefinition of family challenges any theology that would make biological or national kinship the primary determinant of obligation.

The Sermon on the Mount further undermines the distinction between near and distant when Jesus commands: "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44). Enemy-love represents the logical fulfillment of neighbor-love, extending obligation precisely to those most distant relationally, culturally, and politically.

## II. The Theological Tradition: From Augustine to Barth

### A. Augustine: Ordered Loves and the City of God

Augustine's concept of ordered love (ordo amoris) offers a framework for understanding duties to near and distant neighbors. For Augustine, love must be properly ordered according to the true value of its objects. God must be loved supremely, and all other loves ordered in relation to this primary love.

This ordering does not simply privilege the near over the distant. Rather, it insists that all human loves—including love of family and nation—must be subordinated to love of God. When national identity becomes an idol, demanding ultimate allegiance, it distorts the divine order of love.

Augustine's distinction between the City of God and the City of Man further illuminates this tension. The earthly city is characterized by self-love, while the heavenly city is characterized by love of God. Christians are citizens of both cities simultaneously, creating an inherent tension between particular loyalties and universal obligations.

### B. Aquinas: Natural Law and the Common Good

Thomas Aquinas develops a natural law framework that integrates duties to near and distant neighbors. For Aquinas, natural law requires that we seek the good of the whole human community, not merely our immediate circle. The common good encompasses the flourishing of all persons, not merely those proximate to us.

At the same time, Aquinas acknowledges that we have special obligations to those with whom we share particular relationships. He distinguishes between the universal love of charity (caritas) and the particular love of specific persons. These are not competing obligations but rather expressions of a unified virtue operating at different scales of relationship.

### C. Luther: Vocation and the Orders of Creation

Luther's theology of vocation offers another approach to reconciling duties to near and distant neighbors. For Luther, Christians serve God by faithfully executing their responsibilities within divinely established "orders" of family, church, and state. This emphasis on particular responsibilities might seem to support prioritizing the near.

Yet Luther's understanding of these orders was not static or absolutizing. He recognized them as provisional arrangements subject to Christ's lordship. Moreover, he emphasized that Christians belong primarily to the "kingdom of grace" rather than the "kingdom of power." When state authorities command actions contrary to the gospel, Christians must obey God rather than men.

### D. Barth: The Command of God and the Fluidity of Relationships

Karl Barth's treatment of "near and distant neighbors" in Church Dogmatics III/4 represents the most sustained theological engagement with this question. For Barth, the distinctions between near and distant are real but "fluid," "relative," "reversible," and "removable." The nations exist as a feature of divine providence within the covenant of grace, not as permanent "orders of creation."

Most importantly, Barth denies that nearness generates absolute or ultimate obligations. "Even the existence or non-existence of a state," he writes, "does not always constitute a valid reason for war." National identity provides only "an allotted framework" for obedience, not its content. The command of God, not the accident of proximity, determines the content of Christian obligation.

## III. MAGA Christianism: The Distortion of Neighbor-Love

### A. The Absolutization of the Near

MAGA Christianism inverts the biblical and theological tradition by making duties to the near absolute while effectively nullifying duties to the distant. Family, church, and nation become the exclusive spheres of moral obligation, while responsibilities to the broader human community are denied or minimized.

This inversion manifests in three key areas:

1. **Immigration policy**: The physical and legal walls erected against migrants and refugees represent the most concrete manifestation of this nullification of duties to distant neighbors. By framing national sovereignty as an absolute value, MAGA Christianism effectively denies any meaningful obligation to those outside our borders.

2. **Environmental policy**: The rejection of climate action on the grounds that it might harm the domestic economy privileges the immediate interests of the near over the long-term wellbeing of the distant, both geographically (vulnerable communities in the Global South) and temporally (future generations).

3. **Foreign aid and international cooperation**: The "America First" approach to foreign policy systematically subordinates global common goods to narrowly defined national interests, treating welfare spending on citizens as morally obligatory while dismissing foreign aid as optional charity.

### B. Theological Mutations at Work

This distortion of neighbor-love reflects several theological mutations characteristic of MAGA Christianism:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: By selectively citing biblical passages about family responsibilities while ignoring Jesus's radical redefinition of kinship, MAGA Christianism exemplifies primitive biblicism's decontextualized reading of scripture.

2. **Practical Atheism**: While claiming to follow Christ, MAGA Christianism effectively removes Jesus as the exemplar of neighbor-love that transcends tribal boundaries. Instead, it substitutes pragmatic political calculations that privilege the near over the distant.

3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: By dividing the world into deserving "true Americans" and undeserving "others," MAGA Christianism employs a friend/enemy distinction that contradicts the inclusive vision of neighbor-love found in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

4. **Disordered Nationalism**: National identity becomes the primary determinant of moral obligation, effectively replacing the Christian understanding of universal human dignity with a tribal ethic of preferential treatment for co-nationals.

### C. Case Study: The Refugee Crisis

The refugee crisis reveals these distortions with particular clarity. Despite the Bible's consistent commands to welcome the stranger and care for the vulnerable, many white evangelical Christians have been among the strongest opponents of refugee resettlement in the United States.

This opposition directly contradicts the historical Christian commitment to refugee protection. As Woodard-Lehman notes in his analysis of Barth, "The nearest neighbors are not defended for the sake of their nearness or dearness. They are defended for the sake of the distant neighbors in all their unfamiliarity and even hostility." In stark contrast, MAGA Christianism defends borders precisely to protect the near from the distant.

## IV. Reclaiming a Theology of Neighbor-Love

### A. The Particular as Portal to the Universal

A recovered theology of neighbor-love begins by recognizing that particular relationships are not ends in themselves but portals to universal obligation. As Barth insists, "one's own people in their own space cannot, and must not, be a wall, but a door." The near neighbor is not a barrier to the distant neighbor but a pathway.

Jesus models this approach in his incarnation. By embracing a particular human nature, family, and culture, he does not limit his saving work but rather makes it concrete and accessible. The Word becomes flesh not to elevate one nation above others but to reach all nations through one.

### B. From Fluid Boundaries to Porous Borders

Barth's insistence on the "fluid" nature of the distinction between near and distant neighbors has direct implications for how we understand borders. Borders are necessary features of political community, but they must be porous rather than absolute, facilitating rather than preventing movement between communities.

This theological perspective challenges both open borders utopianism and fortress nationalism. It recognizes the legitimate role of borders in maintaining distinct political communities while insisting that these borders must serve the common good of humanity rather than merely national self-interest.

### C. Hospitality as Theological Practice

Practical hospitality emerges as a central Christian virtue in this recovered theology. Hospitality involves welcoming the stranger not as an act of exceptional charity but as a fundamental expression of Christian identity.

Bretherton's concept of "hospitality as holiness" captures this theological dimension. Hospitality is not merely opening one's home but opening one's self to transformation through encounter with the other. This hospitality operates at multiple scales: individual, congregational, and national.

### D. Subsidiarity and Solidarity: Catholic Social Teaching

Catholic social teaching offers valuable resources for navigating duties to near and distant neighbors through the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity.

Subsidiarity holds that matters should be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized competent authority. This validates the importance of proximate relationships and local communities. Yet subsidiarity is always paired with solidarity—the recognition that we are all responsible for all. These principles work together rather than in opposition.

Pope Francis articulates this balance in Fratelli Tutti: "The sense of being a single human family is disappearing, and the dream of working together for justice and peace seems an outdated utopia." Against this fragmentation, he calls for a "better kind of politics" that recognizes both particular identities and universal human dignity.

## V. Practical Implications: Rebuilding the Bridges

### A. Congregational Practices

Churches can embody proper neighbor-love through intentional practices:

1. **Global-Local Integration**: Connecting global mission partnerships with local outreach initiatives to demonstrate the continuity between near and distant neighbors.

2. **Refugee and Immigrant Welcome**: Developing ministries that welcome refugees and immigrants through practical support, relationship building, and advocacy.

3. **Economic Discipleship**: Addressing how consumption patterns and investment decisions affect distant neighbors through supply chains and environmental impacts.

4. **Public Witness**: Advocating for policies that recognize duties to both near and distant neighbors in areas like immigration, foreign aid, and climate action.

### B. National Policies

A recovered theology of neighbor-love would inform a different approach to national policy:

1. **Immigration Reform**: Developing immigration policies that balance legitimate security concerns with generous welcome for refugees and migrants.

2. **Foreign Assistance**: Maintaining robust foreign aid programs that address global poverty, disease, and conflict as moral obligations rather than optional charity.

3. **Climate Action**: Embracing responsibility for addressing climate change as an obligation to both distant neighbors in vulnerable regions and future generations.

4. **International Cooperation**: Participating actively in multilateral institutions and agreements that address global common goods.

### C. Personal Formation

Individual Christians can cultivate proper neighbor-love through:

1. **Proximity to Difference**: Intentionally building relationships across lines of difference to challenge the near/distant binary.

2. **Expanded Information Ecosystems**: Consuming news and information from global sources to maintain awareness of distant neighbors' realities.

3. **Economic Choices**: Making consumption and investment decisions that consider impacts on distant neighbors.

4. **Political Engagement**: Advocating for policies that recognize duties to both near and distant neighbors.

## Conclusion: From Walls to Bridges

MAGA Christianism has distorted Christian neighbor-love by absolutizing the near and nullifying the distant. This distortion is not merely political but profoundly theological, representing multiple mutations of authentic Christian faith.

A recovered theology of neighbor-love recognizes that what we owe to near and distant neighbors is not a zero-sum competition but a both/and obligation. Proximity creates particular responsibilities without nullifying universal ones. As Barth reminds us, true nearness to our own people always sets us on the way toward distant others.

In a world increasingly fragmented by nationalism, tribalism, and fear, this recovered theology offers a radical alternative: a vision of human community where borders are porous rather than absolute, where particular identities open outward rather than close inward, and where love of neighbor—near and distant—reflects the universal love of God.
