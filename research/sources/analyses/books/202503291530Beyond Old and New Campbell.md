I'll synthesize key insights from these texts, focusing on how they contribute to our understanding of Campbell's theological project and its connections to Wells' work.

Key Synthesis Points:

1. Theological Method
Campbell's core argument is about theological method, which closely aligns with the "being with" approach Wells advocates:

- Campbell critiques "foundationalist" theology that tries to establish universal principles before engaging with God's self-disclosure
- He argues for a "backward" theological method that starts with Christ's revelation and works retrospectively
- This mirrors Wells' incarnational theology of "being with" - understanding God through participation rather than abstract principles

2. Christological Centrality
Both Campbell and Wells emphasize Christ as the central revelatory event:

- Campbell argues that the incarnation isn't just a mechanism for atonement, but the very means by which God reveals himself
- Wells sees incarnation as God's "being with" humanity, revealing divine nature through particular engagement
- They both reject approaches that reduce Christ to a transactional figure

3. Participation vs. Contract
A crucial shared theme is rejecting contractual models of salvation:

- Campbell criticizes "justification discourse" that treats salvation as a legal transaction
- He argues for a participatory model where humans are incorporated into Christ's life
- Wells similarly emphasizes participation over legalistic frameworks

4. Trinitarian Understanding
Campbell critiques evangelical theology's functional unitarianism:

- He argues evangelicals lack a robust Trinitarian theology
- This leads to an overly individualistic understanding of salvation
- Wells' work similarly emphasizes the Trinitarian nature of divine revelation

5. Historical and Cultural Critique
Both offer profound critiques of how theological methods get co-opted by cultural narratives:

- Campbell shows how "justification discourse" aligns with liberal individualism
- Wells demonstrates how theological frameworks get shaped by cultural assumptions
- They both call for a more radical, Christ-centered approach that disrupts convenient cultural narratives

6. Theological Anthropology
A shared emphasis on human transformation:

- Campbell argues against seeing humans as autonomous rational agents
- He sees human identity as fundamentally reshaped through participation in Christ
- Wells similarly sees human identity as formed through divine encounter

Emerging Theological Framework:
The synthesis suggests a theological approach characterized by:
- Christological concentration
- Participatory ontology
- Trinitarian depth
- Historical consciousness
- Transformative encounter

Practical Implications:
- Theology is not an abstract system but a lived reality
- Christian identity is formed through participation, not individual achievement
- Salvation is about being incorporated into Christ's life, not a transactional event

Potential Artifact Directions:
1. A comprehensive theological method paper
2. A critique of contemporary evangelical theology
3. A reconstructive proposal for Christian identity formation

Would you like me to develop one of these artifact ideas or explore a specific aspect of this synthesis further?
