# Source Analysis: Theological Frameworks for Critiquing MAGA Christianism

## Source Summaries

### Bretherton, "Christianity and Contemporary Politics" (2010)

- **Key Arguments**: Bretherton develops an account of faithful political witness that can simultaneously maintain Christian particularity while cooperating with religious and non-religious others in pursuit of common goods. He frames this approach using Augustine's understanding of Christians as exiles in Babylon seeking the peace of the city where they find themselves.

- **Methodological Approach**: Case-study analysis of broad-based community organizing, Fair Trade, hospice care, and responses to immigration/refugees, interpreted through Augustinian political theology.

- **Relevant Findings**: 
  1. Christians can pursue the "peace of Babylon" through common action with non-Christians while maintaining theological specificity
  2. Churches can enable "just judgments and neighbor love" within liberal democracies without being co-opted by the state
  3. The church functions not merely as a constituent of civil society but as the specific community that can host a genuine politics

- **Central Framework**: Bretherton proposes "Christian cosmopolitanism" as an alternative to both liberal cosmopolitanism (which erases particularity) and reactionary nationalism (which absolutizes it).

### Bowlin, "Tolerance Among the Virtues" (2016)

- **Key Arguments**: Tolerance is a genuine moral virtue rather than a compromise of principle. It belongs to justice as one of its parts and requires both judgment about which differences are objectionable and which merit patient endurance.

- **Methodological Approach**: Develops a virtue-theoretical account of tolerance through engagement with classical, Christian, and contemporary moral philosophy.

- **Relevant Findings**: 
  1. Tolerance is the virtue that perfects our response to objectionable differences that fall between the "unbearably harmful" and the "harmlessly unobjectionable"
  2. Tolerance can be distinguished from mere indifference, acceptance, and continence (self-restraint)
  3. Tolerance requires both judgment (moral discrimination) and endurance

- **Theological Framework**: Bowlin distinguishes tolerance (belonging to justice) from forbearance (belonging to love), showing how Christian practices transform both.

### O'Donovan et al., "Reimagining Sovereignty" (2018)

- **Key Arguments**: Sovereignty should be reconceived not according to monistic state models but through distributed, consociational arrangements that recognize multiple forms of authority.

- **Methodological Approach**: Critical political theology drawing on medieval constitutional models and contemporary federalist approaches.

- **Relevant Findings**: 
  1. The contemporary "Westphalian" model of sovereignty is neither inevitable nor most conducive to human flourishing
  2. Consociational approaches to sovereignty distribute authority among multiple interdependent, self-organized associations
  3. Religious communities contribute to political imagination beyond liberal state frameworks

- **Theological Significance**: Offers an alternative to binary framing of church/state relations, showing how Christian political thought has historically developed more complex models of distributed authority.

### Bretherton, "Hospitality as Holiness" (2006)

- **Key Arguments**: Hospitality is the normative pattern for faithful relations between Christians and strangers. It represents a more theologically robust alternative to liberal tolerance.

- **Methodological Approach**: Engages with both MacIntyre's account of tradition-guided rationality and Grisez's natural law theory to develop a theological approach to difference.

- **Relevant Findings**: 
  1. The problem of relating to non-Christians requires neither "common ground" nor an abstract public reason
  2. MacIntyre's account of tradition-guided rationality should be modified by attention to the action of the Holy Spirit
  3. Hospitality represents a distinctively Christian approach to difference that neither relativizes truth nor absolutizes boundaries

- **Theological Framework**: Develops hospitality as both a theological concept and practical pattern of relationship that enables Christians to be faithful to particular claims while genuinely engaging others.

## Theological Connections

### Primitive Biblicism

- **Insights**: Bowlin's account of tolerance directly challenges the primitive biblicist claim to unmediated access to biblical meaning. He demonstrates how proper moral discernment requires both interpretive tradition and contextual judgment.

- **Quotes**: "In MacIntyre's useful shorthand, the temporal virtues are always about the difficult and the good, which is to say, among other things, that the good the virtuous desire is pursued in the face of various difficulties and that some of these difficulties remain even as virtue's good is achieved." (Bowlin, 2016, p. 2315)

- **Connections**: Primitive biblicism claims direct access to biblical truth without interpretive mediation, while Bowlin shows how even basic moral concepts require tradition-guided interpretation. Just as the primitive biblicist claims unmediated access to scripture's meaning, so the intolerant person claims unmediated access to moral truth, ignoring the need for prudential judgment about which differences require which responses.

### Practical Atheism

- **Insights**: Bretherton's critique of the "dynamics of co-option, competition, and commodification" in church-state relations directly addresses the practical atheism mutation, showing how the church becomes functionally secular even while maintaining religious language.

- **Quotes**: "For Hauerwas, involvement with the state is permissible, but only on an ad hoc basis...For Hauerwas, the church contributes to civil society but at the same time is an alternative civil society. Its purposes are never simply to help the nation-state and liberal democracy to function." (Bretherton, 2010, p. 1519-1523)

- **Application**: Bretherton's analysis helps explain the "practical atheism" of MAGA Christianism, where Christianity becomes a cultural identity marker that enables rather than challenges political power. He offers a more nuanced alternative of faithful participation without co-optation.

### Binary Apocalypticism

- **Insights**: O'Donovan's consociational model of sovereignty directly challenges the binary friend/enemy distinctions that characterize MAGA Christianism's apocalyptic imagination.

- **Quotes**: "On many fronts, a consociationalist position seems to be an increasingly prevalent, if tacit, recommendation. For example, in response to processes of globalization and the increasing cultural diversity of nation-states, some legal theorists are advocating what amounts to a more consociational approach." (O'Donovan et al., 2018, p. 141)

- **Connections**: Binary apocalypticism divides the world into good/evil, friend/enemy categories, while consociational approaches recognize complex, overlapping jurisdictions and authorities. This offers a theological alternative to the binary thinking that characterizes MAGA Christianism's political imagination.

## Historical Context Connections

- **Untold American Narratives**: Bretherton's analysis of sanctuary movements for refugees reveals how churches have historically created alternative jurisdictions that challenge state sovereignty, offering a precedent for contemporary resistance to nationalist politics.

- **Quotes**: "The practice of sanctuary, as a specific form of Christian hospitality, is the therapy or antidote for anyone rendered bare life under the totalizing thrust of the state. As a practice, it witnesses to the claim that after Christ divine law holds sway and all must eventually come to judgment before Christ the King - both accused and accuser, king and subject, outlaw and law-maker, violated and violator - and all may be forgiven in and through Christ." (Bretherton, 2010, p. 4246)

- **Historical Insights**: Bretherton's discussion of medieval sanctuary practices shows how the contemporary crisis of sovereignty regarding refugees has historical precedents that can inform current theological responses to immigration.

## Political Theology Implications

- **Understanding Christian Nationalism**: Bretherton's framework of "Christian cosmopolitanism" offers a direct alternative to Christian nationalism that maintains both Christian particularity and universal concern.

- **Quotes**: "Within a Christian cosmopolitan framework, the telos of humanity is neither a return to an original state of blessing nor a movement beyond the materiality of creation. Rather, it is a movement, via differentiation and development through history, to an eschatological fulfillment of creation." (Bretherton, 2010, p. 3715)

- **Participatory Freedom Connections**: Bowlin's account of tolerance as virtue directly supports a participatory understanding of freedom as requiring both moral judgment and relationship without domination.

- **Quotes**: "Justice is, after all, the habit that disposes us to desire the good of another with a constant and perpetual will, and it is this good will that in turn disposes the just to 'pronounce according to the right ruling of prudence.'" (Bowlin, 2016, p. 2714)

## Integration with Manuscript Structure

### MAGA Christianism Chapters

- **Chapter 2: The Trinitarian Foundation of Christian Identity**: Bretherton's account of "common objects of love" provides a trinitarian model for understanding how Christians can maintain particularity while engaging in common action with others.

- **Chapter 4: The Formation of Virtue**: Bowlin's virtue-theoretical approach to tolerance offers a rich framework for understanding how virtues are formed through practices rather than merely through principles.

- **Chapter 7: The Priority of the Particular**: Bretherton's emphasis on "special equity" and contextual judgment aligns perfectly with this chapter's focus on applying general principles to particular circumstances.

- **Chapter 12: The Church as Alternative Community**: Both Bretherton and O'Donovan provide frameworks for understanding the church as an alternative community with its own politics rather than merely as a constituency within civil society.

- **Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism**: Bretherton's "Christian cosmopolitanism" and O'Donovan's consociational model both contribute to articulating a third way beyond both MAGA Christianism and secular liberalism.

## Theological Synthesis and Application

The sources demonstrate a remarkable convergence around several key themes that directly counter MAGA Christianism's theological mutations:

1. **Complex Authority**: Against MAGA Christianism's simplistic understanding of authority (either absolute or absent), these sources develop nuanced accounts of overlapping, differentiated authorities that neither collapse into relativism nor expand into absolutism.

2. **Tradition-Guided Moral Discernment**: Against primitive biblicism's claim to unmediated biblical access, these sources demonstrate how moral discernment requires tradition-guided interpretation to distinguish between different kinds of differences and appropriate responses.

3. **Alternative Political Imagination**: Against binary apocalypticism's friend/enemy politics, these sources recover alternative political models from Christian history that enable engagement without domination and particularity without absolutism.

4. **Hospitable Witness**: Against the dynamics of co-option, competition, and commodification, these sources develop a model of Christian witness characterized by hospitality and what Bretherton calls "hallowing bare life."

These theological resources provide not merely a critique of MAGA Christianism but a constructive alternative vision of Christian political witness characterized by:

- **Hospitality without relativism**
- **Particularity without exclusivity**
- **Authority without domination**
- **Judgment without binary thinking**

This alternative vision draws on deep theological and philosophical resources while remaining accessible and practical, offering concrete patterns of faithful political action rather than merely abstract principles.

## Methodological Insights

The sources also suggest several methodological approaches for developing your critique:

1. **Case Study Analysis**: Bretherton's use of concrete case studies (community organizing, sanctuary movements) provides a model for grounding theological critique in actual practices.

2. **Historical Recovery**: All sources demonstrate how recovering neglected historical models (medieval sanctuary, consociational sovereignty) can help imagine alternatives to contemporary arrangements.

3. **Conceptual Clarification**: Bowlin's careful analysis of tolerance demonstrates how precise theological language can counter both the conflation and rejection of important moral concepts.

4. **Constructive Alternative**: Rather than merely critiquing MAGA Christianism, these sources model how to develop a constructive alternative vision rooted in theological resources.

These methodological approaches align with your voice profile as an Episcopal priest who bridges theological, military, and business worlds, offering concrete ways to develop a critique that is both theologically rigorous and practically engaged.
