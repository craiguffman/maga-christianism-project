## 1. Source Metadata
- **Title**: "After Whiteness: Liturgical Ethics & Postcolonial Constantinianism"
- **Author**: Derek Alan Woodard-Lehman
- **Publication**: The Divinity School - Duke University
- **Year**: 2007
- **Type**: Doctoral dissertation/academic paper
- **Primary Discipline**: Theological ethics, with focus on race theory and ecclesiology

## 2. Core Analysis

### Central Thesis
Whiteness functions as a form of postcolonial Constantinianism that shapes ecclesial ethics and practices, requiring a kenotic pedagogy through multicultural congregations to disrupt white habitus and create alternative political imaginaries.

### Key Arguments
1. The "problematic of cultural devastation" and rhetoric of catastrophe in traditionalist approaches (including MacIntyrian virtue ethics) often mask a crisis of whiteness through postcolonial melancholia.

2. Hauerwas's adoption of MacIntyrian traditionalism helps overcome Liberal ethical autonomy but simultaneously reinscribes postcolonial Constantinianism through its inability to address racial segregation.

3. White Christians exist within a "white habitus" that prevents them from seeing and naming racialized realities, thereby perpetuating segregation while denying its existence.

4. Overcoming postcolonial Constantinianism requires white Christians to place themselves under the tutelage of non-white ecclesial communities in a kenotic (self-emptying) posture.

5. Liturgical formation in multicultural congregations provides the necessary "political imaginary" to transcend the colorblind ethics of white congregations.

### Methodology
The author employs:
- Wittgensteinian analysis of language, practices, and social formation
- Critical race theory analysis of whiteness as normative identity
- Theological critique of Christian traditionalism via postcolonial theory
- Sociological analysis of racial formation through "habitus" frameworks
- Comparative ecclesiology between white/homogeneous and multicultural congregations

### Contextual Placement
This work builds on Hauerwas's and Yoder's antimodernist theology while critiquing its limitations regarding race. It connects with Paul Gilroy's postcolonial analysis, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's sociology of racism, and James Perkinson's theological analysis of whiteness while advancing a distinct liturgical-ethical solution.

## 3. Theological Mutation Connections

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Relevant insights**: White habitus creates interpretive enclosure that normalizes segregation while preventing white Christians from seeing alternative readings of Scripture.
- **Supporting quotes**: "White Christians literally cannot see, cannot say, and therefore cannot act ethically in ways that resist the world of postcolonial Constantinianism" (p.16).
- **Potential applications**: Demonstrates how homogeneous congregations perpetuate narrow hermeneutics that bypass critical engagement with difference.

### Practical Atheism
- **Relevant insights**: The ethical self-deception of white Christians who profess universalist theology while practicing racial segregation represents a form of practical atheism.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Thus what is required is a different ecclesial spatialization than MacIntyre's conception of the Church as a highly coherent and well-integrated moral tradition" (p.17).
- **Potential applications**: Addresses the disconnect between professed theological values and embodied ecclesial practices in white churches.

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: The citizen/barbarian distinction identified by Goldberg forms an ancient precursor to white/nonwhite racial binaries that underlie cultural devastation rhetoric.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Citizens are moral, rational, human beings existing inside history and civilization; 'barbarians' are immoral, irrational, inhuman beings existing outside history and civilization" (p.9).
- **Potential applications**: Shows the theological roots of apocalyptic binaries that undergird white supremacist frameworks.

### Disordered Nationalism
- **Relevant insights**: White habitus functions as a form of racial nationalism that merges ecclesial identity with racial identity.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Inasmuch as the culture(s), nation(s), and civilization(s) under threat are those of the West, the problematic of cultural devastation is a crisis of whiteness" (p.8).
- **Potential applications**: Connects racialized ecclesiology to cultural grievance narratives in religious nationalism.

### Prosperity Materialism
- **Relevant insights**: The citizen-barbarian distinction works alongside economic systems to determine moral worth through productivity and economic metrics.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Politics ever (went) hand in hand in generating and maintaining modernity, antimodern traditionalism is not enough to effect disavowal" (p.7).
- **Potential applications**: Explores how economic taxonomies intersect with racial categorization in determining human value.

### Authoritarian Spirituality
- **Relevant insights**: MacIntyrian traditionalism's emphasis on authority and tradition creates theological justification for maintaining racial hierarchies.
- **Supporting quotes**: "MacIntyrian impulse, limited and altered though it may be, relies on 'highly coherent and 'well-integrated' traditions' tending toward insularity" (p.6).
- **Potential applications**: Reveals how appeals to tradition and authority can mask resistance to racial inclusion and justice.

### Tribal Epistemology
- **Relevant insights**: White habitus creates closed epistemological systems that prevent white Christians from recognizing alternative descriptions of reality.
- **Supporting quotes**: "When we are fluent in only one set of concepts, we assume that this set is the only possible set, that our way of seeing the world must be correct" (p.16).
- **Potential applications**: Provides theological account of how racial segregation creates reinforcing epistemic closure.

## 4. Publication Stream Applications

### MAGA Christianism (Monday)
This source provides crucial theoretical frameworks for examining how white Christian nationalism functions as postcolonial Constantinianism, with specific attention to how virtue ethics and traditionalism can inadvertently reinforce racial hierarchies. The citizen/barbarian distinction traced from Aristotle through contemporary politics offers a compelling genealogy for understanding theological dimensions of Christian nationalism.

### Rooted & Reaching (Tuesday)
The concept of "kenotic pedagogy" provides a powerful framework for personal essays exploring one's journey from the insularity of white habitus toward multicultural community. The author's emphasis on concrete, embodied practices over mere theoretical knowledge aligns with this stream's focus on physical and spiritual formation.

### Theological Series (Wednesday)
The theological analysis of white habitus, particularly its liturgical dimensions, offers rich material for examining how church practices shape moral imagination. The paper's integration of Hauerwasian theological ethics with racial analysis creates a bridge between traditional theological concepts and contemporary racial realities.

### Untold America (Thursday)
The historical analysis of how whiteness functions as a "soteriologic" within American Christianity provides important context for understanding religious justifications for segregation. The paper's emphasis on "aversive modernity" offers a lens for exploring alternative American histories that resist European dominance narratives.

### Divine Republic (Friday)
The description of postcolonial melancholia and cultural devastation rhetoric provides perfect satirical fodder, highlighting the absurdity of catastrophic narratives about "civilization" that mask anxieties about racial status. The paper's naming of white habitus offers language for satirizing color-blind discourse.

## 5. Interdisciplinary Dimensions

### Economic Framework
The paper connects theological anthropology to economic systems through its analysis of how "civilization, commerce, and Christianity" intertwine in justifying colonial projects. The author notes how racialized citizenship determines economic worth, with white Christians inheriting economic privileges while denying structural advantages through individualistic explanations.

### Political Theology
The work's core contribution is its analysis of how postcolonial Constantinianism operates through ecclesial segregation that mirrors and reinforces political segregation. The author argues that the Church's political witness is compromised by its embodiment of racial division, requiring liturgical reformation to enable new political imagination.

### Historical Context
The paper traces the citizen/barbarian distinction from Aristotle through colonial modernity, showing how Christian theology was deployed to justify the racialization of humanity. It contextualizes contemporary white Christianity within this colonial legacy, arguing that MacIntyrian appeals to tradition often reinscribe this problematic history.

## 6. Constructive Theological Resources

### Participatory Freedom
The author's call for white Christians to place themselves under the tutelage of non-white communities represents a form of participatory freedom rather than autonomous racial self-development. This aligns with your theological framework emphasizing freedom as participation rather than mere non-interference.

### Being With
The paper emphasizes that the kenotic pedagogy required of white Christians involves "density of interracial experiences" (p.15), reflecting a commitment to "being with" across difference rather than doing things "for" or "to" racial others. This corresponds to Wells' incarnational theology.

### Alternative Models
The multicultural congregation emerges as the primary alternative model to homogeneous white congregations, offering a new "political imaginary" through liturgical practices that break the insularity of white habitus. This represents a constructive alternative to both Liberal individualism and traditionalist insularity.

## 8. Research Gaps

### Limitations
- Limited empirical analysis of actual multicultural congregations
- Does not extensively explore the potential resistance of non-white Christians to white tutelage-seeking
- Could further develop connections between theological virtues and antiracist practices
- Minimal attention to gendered dimensions of white habitus

### Follow-up Questions
- How might actual multicultural congregations implement kenotic pedagogy?
- What are the dangers of instrumentalizing non-white communities for white moral development?
- How does this analysis apply to different denominational contexts?
- What theological resources within white traditions might complement this kenotic approach?

### Potential Counterarguments
- Some might argue the approach risks essentialism by treating "white" and "non-white" as monolithic categories
- Others might suggest that the emphasis on tutelage creates problematic power dynamics
- Traditionalists might contend that shared doctrine, not racial diversity, should be the primary concern for ecclesial unity
- Some could question whether liturgical reform alone is sufficient for addressing structural racism
