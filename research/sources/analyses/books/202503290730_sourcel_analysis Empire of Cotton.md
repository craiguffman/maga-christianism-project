Here is a draft chapter integrating insights from The Empire of Cotton into Part III of your book project on MAGA Christianism, focusing on the mutation of "practical atheism":

PART III: SECOND MUTATION â€“ PRACTICAL ATHEISM 

In this section, we'll explore how a subtle "practical atheism" has infected American Christianity, creating fertile soil for the growth of MAGA Christianism. Drawing on historical analysis from Sven Beckert's The Empire of Cotton alongside theological insights from Reinhold Niebuhr and Stanley Hauerwas, I'll argue that capitalist logics and nationalist ideologies have functionally displaced the Lordship of Christ at the center of much American Christian practice and imagination.

Chapter 9: Reinhold Niebuhr and American Pragmatism

Beckert's analysis of the rise of "war capitalism" in the 18th-19th centuries provides a revealing backdrop to the theological pragmatism of Reinhold Niebuhr in the 20th century. Just as the expansion of the cotton industry relied on externalizing the moral costs of slavery and land expropriation, so Niebuhr's Christian realism functionally externalized Christ's concrete ethical demands. Beckert writes of how "the mechanisms of war capitalism could be externalized thanks to the state's imperial expansion, in effect reducing capitalists' need to recast the domestic social structure." Similarly, Niebuhr's pragmatism allowed American Christians to embrace nationalist and capitalist practices without fundamentally challenging the domestic social order of segregation and inequality. 

Stanley Hauerwas rightly identifies this as a form of "practical atheism" - an affirmation of God in theory that is belied by an operative theology in which Christ's lordship is functionally absent from the "field of action." The Jesus of Niebuhr is, in Hauerwas' words, "simply the name of the one who saves us from sin" while philosophical pragmatism becomes the de facto basis for Christian ethics. When Christianity is reduced to a "value system" malleable to nationalist and capitalist ends, it is ripe for co-optation by the MAGA movement.

Chapter 10: Christ as Supreme Exemplar

Recovering a robust Christology is essential to resisting practical atheism and its MAGA mutations. Beckert notes how the cotton industry depended on "a process, a programming" to "dehumanize another human being." This is the core of the slave trade - denying the full humanity of the enslaved in order to exploit their labor and negate their agency. Similarly, a Niebuhrian "practical atheism" functionally dehumanizes Jesus, reducing him to an abstract savior rather than the supreme exemplar of faithful human life before God.

In contrast, a theology centered on the full humanity of Jesus - his teachings, his practices, his pattern of subversive service and sacrificial love - equips us to recognize and resist the dehumanizing logics of racism and domination wherever they appear. When we take seriously the call to follow Jesus, not just believe in him, we are formed to see the world through resurrection eyes, attuned to God's disruptive inbreaking whenever human dignity is denied. Discipleship to Jesus the supreme exemplar is the ultimate antidote to practical atheism.

Chapter 11: Practices vs. Principles

Beckert's analysis of the cotton empire reveals how capitalist expansion relied on severing economic practices from moral restraints or theological principles. The logic of the market came to dominate all other spheres of valuation. Analogously, practical atheism severs Christian identity from the concrete practices of discipleship, reducing faith to an intellectual assent to abstract principles.

Hauerwas and other theologians have rightly emphasized that Christian faithfulness is a matter of embodied practice, not just assent to propositions. It is through the repeated practices of worship, service, and sacrifice that we are formed into the likeness of Christ. When Christianity accommodates itself to capitalist or nationalist practices and rhythms, it forfeits this transformative power. Cultivating countercultural practices and liturgies is thus essential to resisting the practical atheism that sustains MAGA Christianism.

Chapter 12: The Church as Alternative Community 

Finally, Beckert's work highlights how cotton imperialism depended on state power to reshape the social order, undermining alternative forms of community and meaning-making. Practical atheism likewise diminishes the church's status as an alternative polis, reducing it to a chaplain to nationalism and capitalism rather than a community of eschatological interruption.

Truly resisting MAGA Christianism requires recovering a sense of the church as a distinct community within the nation-state, one shaped by the rhythms of grace rather than the expectations of a consumerist, militarist culture. This is not a call for sectarian withdrawal, but for deeper conversion and thicker practices of social imagination. When the church knows itself as a "colony of heaven," to use Hauerwas' phrase, it gains the necessary distance to critique imperial habits and propose more humane alternatives.

In all these ways, Beckert's analysis of cotton imperialism provides a revealing lens for diagnosing the practical atheism at the heart of MAGA Christianism. Only by re-centering the full humanity of Jesus and the disruptive presence of Jesus' body in the world can we inoculate the church against this subtle but pervasive theological malformation. In the next section, we'll see how practical atheism combines with other distortions to produce an even more noxious compound: the binary apocalypticism of far-right politics.
