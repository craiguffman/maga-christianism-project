# Source Analysis: Nature's Grace

## 1. Source Metadata
- **Title**: "Nature's Grace: Aquinas and Wittgenstein on Natural Law and Moral Knowledge"
- **Author(s)**: John R. Bowlin
- **Publication**: Grammar and Grace: Reformulations of Aquinas and Wittgenstein (edited by Jeffrey Stout and Robert MacSwain)
- **Year**: Unknown (appears to be early 2000s)
- **Type**: Book chapter/essay
- **Primary Discipline**: Philosophical theology

## 2. Core Analysis
- **Central Thesis**: Wittgenstein and Aquinas, despite their historical distance, share important similarities in their approaches to natural law and moral knowledge, particularly in their understanding of how basic human practices, judgments, and inclinations constitute the foundation for moral reasoning.

- **Key Arguments**: 
  1. Aquinas's natural law theory is not primarily designed to address skeptical doubts about morality but to articulate how human action and reason are created by God and governed by providence.
  2. Wittgenstein's account of the "bedrock" of human judgment and action parallels Aquinas's treatment of the first precepts of natural law.
  3. Both thinkers identify certain necessities that mark the boundary between intelligible human action and non-human or irrational behavior.
  4. The relationship between primary and secondary precepts in Aquinas can be understood through Wittgenstein's treatment of concept mastery and epistemic commitment.
  5. Both thinkers resist moral skepticism by suggesting that basic moral judgments are constitutive of human understanding and action.

- **Methodology**: Comparative philosophical analysis that employs what Rorty calls "rational reconstruction" - treating historical figures as if they might have expressed their views differently had they been aware of later conceptual developments.

- **Contextual Placement**: The essay challenges standard interpretations of Aquinas's natural law theory that treat it primarily as a response to moral skepticism. It places both Aquinas and Wittgenstein in a reconceived natural law tradition focused on the conditions of intelligible human action rather than justification of specific moral claims.

## 3. Theological Mutation Connections

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Relevant insights**: Bowlin's analysis opposes the notion of unmediated access to meaning by emphasizing how understanding is embedded in community practices and natural human inclinations.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Milbank reads Wittgenstein's remarks about the natural history of our linguistic practices... Both efforts are designed to specify the necessities that constitute our humanity" (p. 160)
- **Potential applications**: Counters MAGA Christianism's claim to direct, unmediated biblical interpretation by showing how all interpretation depends on participation in human practices and shared judgments.

### Practical Atheism
- **Relevant insights**: The essay shows how both Aquinas and Wittgenstein understand human action as participating in a larger order (for Aquinas, divine providence; for Wittgenstein, a natural form of life).
- **Supporting quotes**: "The natural law is nothing else than the rational creature's participation of the eternal law" (p. 159, quoting Aquinas)
- **Potential applications**: Demonstrates how removing action from its participation in divine order represents a fundamental misunderstanding of human agency and moral reasoning.

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: Both thinkers resist sharp dichotomies in moral reasoning, emphasizing instead the ambiguity and complexity of human judgment.
- **Supporting quotes**: "Real disagreements about the justice of some concrete human activity presuppose broad agreement about 'justice'" (p. 171)
- **Potential applications**: Provides resources for challenging the rigid friend/enemy, good/evil distinctions in MAGA Christianism by showing how moral disagreement presupposes substantial agreement.

### Disordered Nationalism
- **Relevant insights**: The essay suggests that human identity is grounded first in our shared humanity and natural inclinations rather than political or national affiliations.
- **Supporting quotes**: "look around and we will notice that human beings are creatures of one sort and not another, that we act in ways characteristic of our kind..." (p. 172)
- **Potential applications**: Provides foundations for critiquing nationalist identity that places political belonging above our shared humanity and natural inclinations.

### Prosperity Materialism
- **Relevant insights**: The essay emphasizes goods beyond material prosperity as naturally pursued by humans.
- **Supporting quotes**: "we know and will a small collection of ends naturally and necessarily...knowledge, friendship, survival, and so on" (p. 158)
- **Potential applications**: Offers resources for critiquing materialist conceptions of blessing by emphasizing the broader range of human goods that constitute a flourishing life.

### Authoritarian Spirituality
- **Relevant insights**: Both thinkers emphasize how moral knowledge emerges from shared human practices rather than being imposed by authority.
- **Supporting quotes**: "If our nature compels us to society, then it must also compel us to care about justice, and if it compels us to care about justice, to acquire basic mastery of the concept, then it must also compel assent to those commitments that give the concept substance." (p. 172)
- **Potential applications**: Challenges authoritarian models of spiritual leadership by emphasizing moral knowledge as emerging from shared human practices rather than imposed authority.

### Tribal Epistemology
- **Relevant insights**: The essay emphasizes how moral concepts require shared commitments that transcend particular communities.
- **Supporting quotes**: "All of us must concede the truth of some basic conclusiones about justice in order to make use of the concept, and we can recognize that the concept is used across our species precisely because of our substantial agreement in conclusiones." (p. 172)
- **Potential applications**: Provides resources for critiquing closed information systems by emphasizing how shared human nature grounds cross-cultural communication and understanding.

## 4. Publication Stream Applications

- **MAGA Christianism (Monday)**: The analysis provides important philosophical and theological foundations for critiquing how MAGA Christianism misunderstands the relationship between nature, grace, and moral knowledge. It offers resources for explaining how common human moral intuitions are not opposed to Christian theology but integrated within it.

- **Rooted & Reaching (Tuesday)**: The essay's exploration of the "bedrock" of human understanding provides material for personal reflection on how spiritual formation occurs within practices and communities, not just through abstract propositions or individualistic experience.

- **Theological Series (Wednesday)**: Offers rich material for lexicon entries on "Natural Law," "Moral Knowledge," and "Common Grace," showing how these concepts have been understood in the Christian tradition and their relevance for contemporary debates.

- **Untold America (Thursday)**: Provides historical context for understanding how natural law thinking has been both used and misused in American religious history, and how recovering a more nuanced understanding might reshape our historical understanding.

- **Divine Republic (Friday)**: The essay's critique of moral skepticism offers satirical potential for exposing the inconsistency of those who claim moral relativism while making absolute moral claims in political contexts.

## 5. Interdisciplinary Dimensions

- **Economic Framework**: The essay does not directly address economic assumptions, but its emphasis on human goods beyond material prosperity and its critique of individualism provide implicit challenges to neoliberal economic frameworks.

- **Political Theology**: By situating moral knowledge in shared human practices and inclinations, the essay suggests a political theology that recognizes common ground across political differences while resisting both moral relativism and authoritarian imposition.

- **Historical Context**: The essay provides important historical context by showing how Aquinas's natural law theory has been misunderstood when read through modern concerns about skepticism rather than his theological context of divine providence and creation.

## 6. Constructive Theological Resources

- **Participatory Freedom**: The essay supports a participatory understanding of freedom by showing how both Aquinas and Wittgenstein understand human action as participation in a larger order (divine providence or natural form of life) rather than mere absence of constraint.

- **Being With**: The analysis emphasizes how moral concepts and judgments emerge from shared human practices, supporting an incarnational "being with" approach to theology that grounds knowledge in relationship rather than abstraction.

- **Alternative Models**: The essay provides resources for an alternative model to MAGA Christianism's approach to moral knowledge - one that recognizes shared human nature and practices as a ground for moral reasoning while rejecting both authoritarian imposition and relativistic skepticism.

## 7. Integration Points

- **Chapter Connections**: 
  - MAGA Ch 1: Provides philosophical foundation for explaining the theological mutations
  - MAGA Ch 3: Offers direct critique of primitive biblicism through its account of interpretation
  - Untold America Ch 4: Provides historical context for different strands of theological thinking in American history

- **Source Relationships**: This source connects well with:
  - James K.A. Smith's work on practices and formation
  - Stanley Hauerwas on narrative and community
  - Charles Taylor on modern moral frameworks

- **Thematic Contributions**: Key themes enhanced include:
  - The relationship between nature and grace
  - The social/communal dimension of moral knowledge
  - The integration of reason and faith
  - Critique of moral skepticism and relativism

## 8. Research Gaps

- **Limitations**: 
  - The essay does not extensively address how specific moral principles are derived from natural inclinations
  - Limited discussion of how this approach addresses genuine moral disagreement across cultures
  - Does not fully address the challenge of how revelation relates to natural moral knowledge

- **Follow-up Questions**: 
  - How might this understanding of natural law inform specific contemporary moral debates?
  - What are the implications for interfaith dialogue and cooperation?
  - How does this understanding relate to postcolonial critiques of natural law?

- **Potential Counterarguments**: 
  - Some might argue that this approach fails to account for radical moral disagreement across cultures
  - Others might contend that it doesn't sufficiently distinguish Christian ethics from general human morality
  - Liberation theologians might question whether this approach adequately addresses structural injustice
