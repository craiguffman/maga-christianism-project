## 1. Source Metadata
- **Title**: Neoliberalism and Its Enemies (Series)
- **Author(s)**: Matthew Yglesias
- **Publication**: Slow Boring (Substack)
- **Year**: 2024
- **Type**: Article series
- **Primary Discipline**: Political economy, policy analysis

## 2. Core Analysis
- **Central Thesis**: While neoliberal economic policies need significant revision, particularly regarding China and national security, the core economic principles of growth-oriented regulatory policy coupled with redistributive taxation remain sound.
- **Key Arguments**: 
  - Traditional free trade economics remains valid, though security concerns justify strategic departures regarding China
  - Anti-neoliberal critics wrongly reject Obama-era economic policies that correctly prioritized full employment
  - Tax and safety net policies should remain the primary means of addressing income distribution, while regulatory policy should focus on growth
  - Economic nationalism should be limited to genuine national security concerns rather than becoming a general protectionist ideology
  - Policy should adapt once full employment is achieved rather than continuing to advance ideas premised on high unemployment
- **Methodology**: Policy analysis drawing on economic theory and recent political history
- **Contextual Placement**: Intervenes in progressive debate about the future of Democratic economic policy in the post-neoliberal era

## 3. Theological Mutation Connections

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement, though implicitly critiques dogmatic adherence to economic orthodoxy
- **Supporting quotes**: "Time has proven the optimists wrong, and (perhaps providing evidence that policy arguments are more good-faith than people sometimes think) it's now broadly accepted that US-China trade policy needs to reflect a competitive international environment and deviate significantly from a textbook free trade regime." (Part I)
- **Potential applications**: Offers parallel to how religious texts require contextual interpretation rather than rigid application

### Practical Atheism
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: Rejects binary framing of economic policy debates in favor of nuanced, contextual approaches
- **Supporting quotes**: "I think the old consensus about the geopolitical aspects of trade with China was wrong. But I think the traditional *economic* analysis of trade remains clear and compelling." (Part I)
- **Potential applications**: Offers model for avoiding apocalyptic either/or thinking in favor of both/and approaches

### Disordered Nationalism
- **Relevant insights**: Directly addresses economic nationalism, distinguishing justified security concerns from protectionist ideology
- **Supporting quotes**: "Another way of framing this is that adjusting trade policy to account for strategic competition with China is an economic cost to the United States. Deciding that we need a domestic semiconductor industry, in other words, is perfectly reasonable, but it's similar to the calculation that we need aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines." (Part I)
- **Potential applications**: Provides framework for distinguishing legitimate national interest from nationalist ideology

### Prosperity Materialism
- **Relevant insights**: Implicitly challenges prosperity gospel thinking by emphasizing taxation and redistribution
- **Supporting quotes**: "I think people should recommit themselves not necessarily to 'neoliberalism' (which, again, means many things to many different people), but to the idea that taxes and the safety net are the primary means of addressing the distribution of income and that regulatory policy should be geared towards growth, rather than bank shot efforts at redistribution." (Part III)
- **Potential applications**: Offers secular parallel to theological critiques of prosperity thinking

### Authoritarian Spirituality
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

### Tribal Epistemology
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement, though implicitly critiques tribalized economic thinking
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

## 4. Publication Stream Applications
- **MAGA Christianism (Monday)**: Provides framework for analyzing economic nationalism in Christian nationalist discourse
- **Rooted & Reaching (Tuesday)**: Limited direct application
- **Theological Series (Wednesday)**: Could inform discussions of Christian approaches to economic policy that avoid binary thinking
- **Untold America (Thursday)**: Offers perspective on economic history that avoids both uncritical celebration and total rejection
- **Divine Republic (Friday)**: Provides material for satirical exploration of competing economic ideologies

## 5. Interdisciplinary Dimensions
- **Economic Framework**: Directly addresses economic theory regarding trade, growth, and income distribution
- **Political Theology**: Limited direct engagement, though raises questions about moral frameworks for economic policy
- **Historical Context**: Places current debates in context of Obama-era policies and evolving understanding of China

## 6. Constructive Theological Resources
- **Participatory Freedom**: Implicitly supports economic policies that enable broad participation in prosperity
- **Being With**: Limited direct relevance
- **Alternative Models**: Offers pragmatic model for policy thinking that avoids ideological rigidity, potentially applicable to theological contexts

## 7. Integration Points
- **Chapter Connections**: Most relevant to chapters addressing economic dimensions of Christian nationalism and prosperity theology
- **Source Relationships**: Complements critiques of binary thinking and nationalism while offering constructive alternatives
- **Thematic Contributions**: Enhances understanding of the economic policy context in which religious nationalism operates

## 8. Research Gaps
- **Limitations**: Limited engagement with religious dimensions of economic nationalism; focuses primarily on policy rather than cultural factors
- **Follow-up Questions**: How do religious communities conceptualize the relationship between national economic interest and theological commitments? How might theological resources inform approaches to economic policy?
- **Potential Counterarguments**: Some might argue economic costs of trade deserve greater emphasis; others might question whether growth-oriented regulatory policy can address structural inequality
