## 2. Core Analysis
- **Central Thesis**: Democrats inadvertently reinforce Trump's falsehoods by repeating them in attempts to debunk them, due to the Illusory Truth Effect which makes repeated statements seem more believable regardless of accuracy.
- **Key Arguments**: 
  1. The Illusory Truth Effect is a cognitive phenomenon where repeated information seems more true, even when false
  2. This effect occurs even when the repetition is meant to fact-check or debunk the information

  4. Democrats should focus on exposing opponents' motivations rather than repeating their falsehoods
- **Methodology**: Application of cognitive psychology research to political communication strategy
- **Contextual Placement**: Contributes to discourse on effective political communication and countering disinformation
