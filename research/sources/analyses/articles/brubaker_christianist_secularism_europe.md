## 1. Source Metadata
- **Title**: A New "Christianist" Secularism in Europe
- **Author(s)**: Rogers Brubaker
- **Publication**: The Immanent Frame (Social Science Research Council)
- **Year**: 2016
- **Type**: Article
- **Primary Discipline**: Sociology/Political theory

## 2. Core Analysis
- **Central Thesis**: In Northern and Western Europe, a paradoxical new "Christianist" secularism has emerged where Christianity is invoked not as a religion but as a civilizational identity marker counterposed to Islam, and is increasingly associated with secularism and liberal values like gender equality and gay rights.

- **Key Arguments**: 
  1. The preoccupation with Islam as a civilizational threat has led to a reactive "Christianism" that functions as a marker of identity rather than a system of belief
  2. The distinctive secularization of Northern and Western Europe makes Christianity available for reinterpretation in cultural or civilizational terms
  3. The culturalization of religion allows Christianity to be privileged as culture while minority religious practices can be restricted
  4. The civilizational frame maps Christianity/Islam onto a series of binary oppositions: liberal/illiberal, individualist/collectivist, modern/backward, secular/religious

- **Methodology**: Conceptual analysis of contemporary political discourse and social phenomena

- **Contextual Placement**: Contributes to scholarly debates about secularization, religious identity, and populist politics in Europe

## 3. Theological Mutation Connections

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Relevant insights**: The article describes how Christianity becomes detached from theological content while retaining identity markers
- **Supporting quotes**: "In this uniquely secularized context, where serious forms of Christian religiosity are marginalized, Christianity is readily available for reinterpretation in cultural or civilizational terms, with no reference to matters of theology, belief, or ritual."
- **Potential applications**: Helps explain how religious symbols can be deployed without substantive theological engagement

### Practical Atheism
- **Relevant insights**: Brubaker directly addresses the phenomenon of "Christianism" as a form of practical atheism
- **Supporting quotes**: "This reactive Christianity (or 'Christianism,' to use a term coined by Andrew Sullivan to designate a counterpart to Islamism) presents itself as closely linked with secularity and liberalism."
- **Potential applications**: Provides conceptual framework for understanding how Christian identity can be separated from Christian practice

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: Brubaker analyzes how civilizational framing creates binary oppositions
- **Supporting quotes**: "The distinction between Christianity and Islam is mapped onto a series of normatively charged oppositions: between liberal and illiberal, individualist and collectivist, democratic and authoritarian, modern and backward, and secular and religious."
- **Potential applications**: Demonstrates how religious identity becomes folded into apocalyptic binary frameworks

### Disordered Nationalism
- **Relevant insights**: The article directly addresses the relationship between nationalism and "civilizationism"
- **Supporting quotes**: "To the extent that the civilizational contrast between the Judeo-Christian West and Islam becomes the master frame of the national-populist Right, this might signal a shift from a national to a civilizational register, and from nationalism to what one might call 'civilizationalism.'"
- **Potential applications**: Provides framework for understanding how religious identity becomes incorporated into nationalist frameworks

### Authoritarian Spirituality
- **Relevant insights**: Brubaker notes the paradoxical presentation of Christianity as marker of liberalism
- **Supporting quotes**: "Once understood as antithetical to liberalism, secularism, and modernity, Christianity is increasingly seen as their civilizational matrix"
- **Potential applications**: Helps explain how "Christian values" can be invoked to justify authoritarian policies

### Tribal Epistemology
- **Relevant insights**: The article addresses how civilizational framing creates bounded knowledge communities
- **Supporting quotes**: "The culturalization of citizenship brings religion to the fore in debates about immigration, integration, and citizenship."
- **Potential applications**: Shows how knowledge claims become tied to civilizational identity markers

### Prosperity Materialism
- **Relevant insights**: Not directly addressed in the provided excerpt
- **Supporting quotes**: N/A
- **Potential applications**: Could explore economic dimensions of civilizational identity claims

## 4. Publication Stream Applications
- **MAGA Christianism (Monday)**: Provides theoretical framework for understanding "Christianism" as distinct from Christianity
- **Rooted & Reaching (Tuesday)**: Offers reflection points on distinction between religious identity and practice
- **Theological Series (Wednesday)**: Essential for lexicon entry on "Christianism" concept
- **Untold America (Thursday)**: Provides comparative framework for examining American religious nationalism
- **Divine Republic (Friday)**: Rich material for satirizing contradictions in "Christianist" discourse

## 5. Interdisciplinary Dimensions
- **Economic Framework**: Limited economic analysis in provided excerpt
- **Political Theology**: Central focus on how religious identity functions in political discourse
- **Historical Context**: Examines development of secularization and culturalization of religion in Europe

## 6. Constructive Theological Resources
- **Participatory Freedom**: By contrast, highlights need for substantive rather than nominal religious engagement
- **Being With**: Implicitly critiques inability of civilizational framework to engage with difference
- **Alternative Models**: Points toward more substantive forms of religious engagement with pluralism

## 7. Integration Points
- **Chapter Connections**: Central to chapters on practical atheism and disordered nationalism
- **Source Relationships**: Develops concept of "Christianism" introduced in Brubaker's "Between Nationalism and Civilizationism"
- **Thematic Contributions**: Provides key conceptual framework for distinguishing between substantive Christianity and identitarian Christianism

## 8. Research Gaps
- **Limitations**: Focuses primarily on European context with limited application to American context
- **Follow-up Questions**: How does American "Christianism" differ from European variants? How might authentic religious communities respond to the challenge of "Christianism"?
- **Potential Counterarguments**: Some might argue that concerns about Islam are rooted in legitimate theological differences rather than mere civilizational identity politics
