- **Potential applications**: Demonstrates how professed religious values of equality often coexist with acceptance of significant economic inequality

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: The distribution shows a complex economic spectrum rather than simple rich/poor binary
- **Supporting quotes**: The data shows nine income brackets with varying percentages, not a simple binary division
- **Potential applications**: Provides nuanced data to counter simplistic apocalyptic narratives of economic division

### Disordered Nationalism

- **Potential applications**: Provides empirical context for analyzing prosperity theology claims about wealth and blessing

- **Supporting quotes**: The distribution percentages across nine income brackets indicate substantial hierarchy
- **Potential applications**: Helps analyze how economic hierarchy can reinforce authoritarian religious structures

### Tribal Epistemology
