## 1. Source Metadata
- **Title**: Producing Colorblindness
- **Author(s)**: Jennifer C. Mueller (based on context)
- **Publication**: Likely an academic journal (specific journal not identified)
- **Year**: Unknown (likely 2010s or later)
- **Type**: Academic article
- **Primary Discipline**: Sociology, critical race theory

## 2. Core Analysis
- **Central Thesis**: Colorblindness should be understood not merely as a structural ideology but as a culturally recursive accomplishment grounded in an "epistemology of ignorance" - a process of knowing designed to produce not-knowing about white privilege and structural white supremacy.
- **Key Arguments**: 
  - Most analyses focus on the structural elements of colorblindness, but this can obscure whites' agency and innovation in reproducing racial inequality
  - Analyzing 105 white college students' responses to racial inequality information reveals active "epistemic maneuvers" to repair breaches in normative colorblindness
  - These maneuvers demonstrate white people's vested commitment to maintaining ideologies that buttress racial domination
  - This approach reveals continuities between contemporary colorblindness and historical white supremacy
  - Even whites who acknowledge some aspects of structural racial advantage can still engage in epistemic practices that maintain ignorance
  - Effective racial justice education requires moving beyond "generating awareness" to "making ignorance more difficult"
- **Methodology**: Qualitative analysis of 105 family wealth analyses produced by white college undergraduates researching racial inequality and the wealth gap
- **Contextual Placement**: Contributes to scholarly literature on colorblind racism by emphasizing agency, process, and the active maintenance of ignorance

## 3. Theological Mutation Connections

### Primitive Biblicism
- **Relevant insights**: Parallels how certain interpretive practices actively work to maintain ignorance rather than generate understanding
- **Supporting quotes**: "Contemporary colorblindness is not about not seeing race any more than inventing mythological race was about seeing 'real' racial difference." (para. 3)
- **Potential applications**: Provides framework for understanding how religious texts are selectively interpreted to maintain comfortable ignorance rather than challenge existing power structures

### Practical Atheism
- **Relevant insights**: Addresses gap between professed beliefs and practices that maintain racial hierarchy
- **Supporting quotes**: "Analyzing a large, nationally representative sample, Douglas Hartmann, Joseph Gerteis, and Paul Croll (2009) found it was not uncommon that whites today could identify ways they are structurally advantaged by race while still embracing color-blind beliefs." (para. 4)
- **Potential applications**: Offers parallel to religious contexts where theoretical knowledge fails to transform practice

### Binary Apocalypticism
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

### Disordered Nationalism
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement, though implicitly addresses how national narratives maintain racial hierarchy
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Could inform analysis of how nationalist narratives employ similar epistemic maneuvers to maintain preferred narratives

### Prosperity Materialism
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

### Authoritarian Spirituality
- **Relevant insights**: Limited direct engagement
- **Supporting quotes**: None directly applicable
- **Potential applications**: Limited relevance to this theological mutation

### Tribal Epistemology
- **Relevant insights**: Directly addresses epistemological practices that maintain group ignorance
- **Supporting quotes**: "Colorblindness is about culturally sustaining an ignorance useful for cloaking and reproducing the contemporary structural mechanics of a white supremacy that is now centuries old." (para. 3)
- **Potential applications**: Provides sophisticated framework for understanding how religious groups maintain epistemic practices that preserve comfortable ignorance

## 4. Publication Stream Applications
- **MAGA Christianism (Monday)**: Provides framework for analyzing how Christian nationalist discourse employs similar epistemic maneuvers to maintain preferred narratives
- **Rooted & Reaching (Tuesday)**: Offers framework for personal reflection on how we actively maintain comfortable ignorance
- **Theological Series (Wednesday)**: Could inform discussions of how theological education often fails to transform practice
- **Untold America (Thursday)**: Directly relevant to understanding how American historical narratives are shaped by active ignorance maintenance
- **Divine Republic (Friday)**: Offers material for satirical exploration of how ignorance is actively produced rather than simply existing

## 5. Interdisciplinary Dimensions
- **Economic Framework**: Addresses racial wealth gap as central to analysis
- **Political Theology**: Implicitly addresses how dominant groups maintain theological narratives that preserve power
- **Historical Context**: Provides explicit analysis of continuities between contemporary and historical forms of white supremacy

## 6. Constructive Theological Resources
- **Participatory Freedom**: Implicitly suggests that genuine freedom requires confronting actively maintained ignorance
- **Being With**: Limited direct relevance
- **Alternative Models**: By illuminating processes of ignorance maintenance, provides foundation for developing alternatives

## 7. Integration Points
- **Chapter Connections**: Most relevant to chapters addressing tribal epistemology, practical atheism, and the dynamics of maintaining theological ignorance
- **Source Relationships**: Complements Brubaker's analysis by focusing on specific epistemic practices within broader ideological frameworks
- **Thematic Contributions**: Offers sophisticated framework for understanding how ignorance is actively maintained rather than merely existing

## 8. Research Gaps
- **Limitations**: Limited engagement with specifically religious dimensions of ignorance maintenance
- **Follow-up Questions**: How do theological institutions employ similar epistemic maneuvers to maintain preferred narratives? How might religious education move beyond "generating awareness" to "making ignorance more difficult"?
- **Potential Counterarguments**: Some might argue the focus on agency overstates individual responsibility for structural conditions; others might question whether the concept of "epistemic maneuvers" attributes too much intentionality to largely unconscious processes
