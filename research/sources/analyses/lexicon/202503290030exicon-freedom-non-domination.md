## Definition
Freedom as non-domination refers to a theological and political understanding of freedom that goes beyond mere non-interference (negative liberty) to emphasize the absence of the capacity for arbitrary interference or domination in one's life. In theological terms, it represents freedom as the capacity for authentic fellowship with God, creation, and neighbor as revealed in the Trinity.

## Etymology
While the philosophical concept was developed by Philip Pettit in contemporary political philosophy, its theological roots can be traced to the Christian understanding of liberation from sin and death through Christ, and the freedom of love that exists within the Trinity. The concept builds on republican political thought that emphasizes freedom from arbitrary power rather than mere absence of constraint.

## Theological Significance
Theologically, freedom as non-domination reframes our understanding of:

1. **Trinitarian Life**: The Divine Persons exist in perfect fellowship without domination or subordination, revealing freedom as mutual indwelling and love rather than independence or autonomy.

2. **Salvation**: Christ liberates us from both the domination of sin and from systems that prevent authentic fellowship with God and neighbor. 

3. **Ecclesiology**: The church is called to be a community where domination is replaced by mutual submission and love, witnessing to God's intention for all humanity.

4. **Political Engagement**: Christians seek political arrangements that minimize domination for all people, not just securing power for themselves.

## Contrast with MAGA Christianism
MAGA Christianism often reduces freedom to negative liberty (freedom from interference), which:

1. Disconnects freedom from relationship, making individual autonomy the highest good
2. Fails to recognize how systems can dominate without direct interference
3. Allows for the perpetuation of structural domination while celebrating individual liberty
4. Reduces Christian freedom to political autonomy rather than the capacity for love

By contrast, freedom as non-domination envisions political arrangements that enable genuine fellowship across differences, recognizing that authentic human flourishing emerges not from autonomy but from right relationship with God, creation, and neighbor.
