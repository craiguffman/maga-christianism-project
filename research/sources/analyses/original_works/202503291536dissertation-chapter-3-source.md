## Key Themes
- Ramist Realism
- Hermeneutical Critique
- Theological Interpretation
- Particularity in Ethical Reasoning

## Central Arguments

## Methodological Approach

- Historical examination of Hooker's critique
- Theological deconstruction of universal rule-based interpretation

## Critical Insights
### Philosophical Critique

- Removes Jesus as exemplar
- Creates static understanding of divine revelation

## Key Quotes
> "Scripture is not a catalog to be mined, but a practice that forms us in the mind of Christ."

> "The particular is the proper focus of ethical reasoning precisely because the general can only approximate the natural law."
