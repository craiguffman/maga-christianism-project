# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 14

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. We have one of those stories that, uh. Causes us to say also, you know, wow, what a, what an intriguing story. Why in the world do we have that as our gospel text? How in the world is the story of the beheading of John the Baptist? Good news for us. Um, so, so I wanna welcome you if you're just joining us.

We have been working through the Gospel of Mark for the last several months. This year we're doing a close reading. Of the gospel of Mark, uh, in a, in a way that I, I describe as literarily, you know, taking the gospel for what it is, a work of art, of inspired art, but that is literature as well. And, and so that we're paying attention to those, those, um.

Things that the, that the author does that, that in trying to understand why would they put this in the portrait? They're trying to answer the [00:01:00] question, who is this Jesus? Who, who was this Jesus, uh, in his time? Who, uh, is this Jesus whom we encounter in our daily lives? And, and so, uh, each of the gospel writers have.

Have, uh, uh, have, have unique ways of, of characterizing their experience of Jesus. So why Mark, why did Mark include this story? Um, and we are, we, we find ourselves in the gospel of, of Mark in chapter six. It's a very interesting chapter. Uh, it's an interlude, if you will. Mark is, uh, if you've been following with us, you know, he, he has, he has, uh, had a a time of, of Jesus recruiting the disciples, training the disciples.

Practicing, if you will, uh, beginning the proclamation of his kingdom, uh, doing all sorts of healings. And he's, and he's, and we've seen that he's done that, uh, you know, primarily, uh, within Galilee and then particularly to, uh, his own people, uh, that is the Jewish people within [00:02:00] the, the province, uh, of, of Galilee.

Uh, the Archy of Galilee, uh, as the Romans would put it. And then he is also crossed the Great divide. He's crossed the lake, uh, the sea, as Mark calls it, of Galilee, and gone to the other side. And he's done those same things and the areas that were not primarily Jewish, those, those areas that were primarily, um, Gentile.

And he's taken this message on the road and, uh, and so they've crossed the sea multiple times. And in, in both cases, uh. Jesus has, has, has encountered some success. Uh, but, but in the most recent, in these, in this chapter here in chapter six, what we've seen is, uh, and what we see inclusive of today's story is Mark is pausing his story to see, uh, three, um, or to give us three sketches of rising social.

And political opposition in within Galilee to Jesus's Kingdom [00:03:00] Proclamation in 32 verses in the first 32 verses. In this chapter, mark Leaks three interrelated vignettes of rejection of the Jesus movement. First. In his own hometown where we saw, uh, and we get the story about you can't be a prophet in your hometown, you know, where Jesus goes home and the, and the absence of faith, uh, uh, uh, in, in, uh, from his, from his own family and friends and from which he grew up, uh, caused, uh, uh, him to be in efficacious in doing those same things.

They, they, you know, their lack of faith caused him to be unable to perform many of the great feats. He was a. He was not seen as a prophet in his own hometown. And then we, we saw him last week, uh, sending out the disciples two by two, warning them of the fact that they would in fact, encounter all sorts of opposition, uh, as, as they went out on their own for the first time.

And then we have, uh, uh, this [00:04:00] encounter with. The government, this encounter with, uh, what Jesus is gonna later call in chapter eight, verse 15, the Leaven of Herod. He talks about the leaven of the Pharisees. We've seen, you know, that which the Pharisees have wrought in Jesus's social engagement. Uh, already in his, in is, is proclaiming, um, the, the kingdom and how to, uh, fulfill God's instruction over and against the way that the Pharisees were.

We're teaching it. Well now we see Jesus, uh, engaging. What he, uh, calls, uh, later he will call, Jesus will call the leaven of Herod, that which Herod had wrought. So why did Mark conclude this story of John the Baptist Death in this spot? In the narrative right after the story of Jesus' rejection in his own home and his sending out of the missionaries and right before they returned and, and tell him how it [00:05:00] all went, and immediately before he stages that incredible feast.

In the wilderness where he turns loaves of bread and fish, uh, into, uh, into such quantity that, uh, they were overflowing and had actually excesses. They were able to fill, fill 12 symbolic bushels, uh, more after everyone had had their fill. Well, that's a very good question. I think, um. So let's dive into it.

This vignette, um, begins with the notice that Herod TPA was aware of Jesus's movement. Let's talk about who Herod Al was. Herod tpa was the son of King Herod the great one of, of, of many sons. Now, he wanted to become, be named as a king. He. He had, uh, delusions of grandeur. His father was her the great who had unified all of, of, uh, of [00:06:00] Palestine in one kingdom, uh, in his time, and built the great, uh, temple.

Uh, but his sons, uh, the ones who survived her, the greats, uh. Petro or, or not petro side, but uh, whatever you call it when you kill your own children, those who survived, uh, ended up surviving him. But, but the Romans divided his kingdom into multiple provinces, one of which was when we call Galilee and he, and refused to give them the name King.

And so Herod the Bible, we'll call him King. Herod at times, but that's more of a mocking tone. He was actually called a arch. He was something like a prince, never given by the Romans. Uh, the, the, the title king, though he agitated for it. In fact, his agitation for that glory would ultimately lead to his exile by the Romans.

They finally said, we're gonna swat that mosquito. Get rid of him. He's such a pain. And replace him with someone who's less of a pain to us. All over that. Um, we learned that, uh, [00:07:00] Herod Antip is aware of the Jesus movement. This is the, you know, what he's aware of Jesus and also the impact that Jesus is having.

And he's worried because he's sort of seeing this type of story before, uh, we learned that there's all sorts of speculation about who this Jesus is. Um, and, uh. Uh, all of the categories about, uh, you know, of that speculation, assign him some kind of authority and power that would normally be attributed to a prophet.

So there, there's arguing about Jesus, who Jesus is, but there's no arguing about whether or not he is in the category of the prophets of old. Uh, who, who had spoken with particular authority and exercised extraordinary authority, uh, of divine authority over the Jewish people. And all of that speculation then leads us into leads Mark to then to tell us and reflect upon the story of John the Baptizer in Herod.

Now I wanna remind you from our previous stories that Mark has already [00:08:00] helped us to know and the other gospel, uh, stories tell us. That, that, uh, Jesus will name, uh, John the Baptist as, uh, Herod. As Herod the Great, uh, so not, excuse me, not Herod the great as, as, as Elijah, as Elijah the prophet is the fulfillment of Elijah the prophet.

The prophet Elijah, who of course is the one who. Comes and will proceed, uh, the Messiah, when the Messiah comes in Jewish folklore. And so John, the Baptizer, Jesus will tell us was Elijah, uh, in that sense. So all of this leads us to this very intriguing story. John's, uh, we hear that John, uh, is a prelude.

John has made certain charges, uh, against. Herod Herod tpa and his wife ods, uh, that have, have incurred the wrath, particularly of Herods. If you notice in here, uh, TPA was intrigued by Jesus and intrigued by John. [00:09:00] Uh, he, he had respect for John. Uh, you know, that, that, that word respect might be fear of John.

He saw him as a charismatic leader who saw who, who raised up a, a large number of disciples. Uh, he was something of a threat. Uh, as it says, you know, anti P didn't actually get John, uh, the Baptizer. Uh, but, but he, but he saw his power, but his wife on the other hand, uh, uh, was, was not so intrigued. She was just threatened.

So let's dig into what happened. John The Baptizer made a prophetic critique against their wedding. We learned, uh, let's unpack all this so that we can see, you know, the, the, the soap opera that is being described before us. Uh. At, you know, the, the seat of government, don't forget Herod tpa is, is the king of the Jews in, in his area.

He, uh, he himself, the problem with he with Herod, the Great, and he, and, and Herod tpa, you know, all of Herod the Great Sons, was that they were only half Jewish and therefore [00:10:00] most Jews did not recognize their rights to kingship whatsoever. Uh, we already saw in the, in the Old Testament reading today, uh, that, that, that, that God was fed up Yahweh was.

Fed up with these shepherds who had not served the sheep, and that very much described Herod tpa. And, uh, and, and his herodians, uh, they, they, uh, had adopted Hellenistic ways. And so they, they lived as kings of the Jews, uh, as king of the Jews. And, and the court, uh, that led the key that led the Jews. Uh, but they didn't practice, uh, the ways of the Jews.

Uh, so they were hypocrites. Uh, who, who ruled the Jews of Galilee? Now Herod Antipas first marriage was very much a political marriage. We don't know much about his wife in terms of her personality and stuff, but what we know that's most important was that she was the daughter of Reta, the fourth, the king of Natia.

Now, Natia was a region on the Eastern flank [00:11:00] of the Roman Empire, and most important thing we need to know about that was that it was a, an empire. It was a kingdom that was capable of attacking militarily. Galilee. And, uh, and that was important, uh, to Rome, you know, that, uh, that, that, uh, uh, that, that they have their flank protected.

And so they, uh, the Romans, uh, conquered Natia and, and it became a protector and they gave Roman citizenship to, to their folks. Um, but so anyway, so Herod Antioch did a political marriage joining, uh, his. You know, Galilee with Natia as a way of protecting his own, uh, Galilee, uh, region from attack, from Natia, uh, which could have happened.

But then Herod anti divorced her. So let's just pause there. He divorced her. We'll come back to that. Meanwhile, Roia was. First, the wi. This was her second marriage too. [00:12:00] She was the wife of Antipas brother, who was a fellow. Ty Tera. A Tera means they divided the kingdom into four parts. One of those went to to ga, to to, uh, anti P.

Another one went to his brother who was still alive. So. While he was still alive, she used her Roman citizenship to do something. Jews weren't allowed to do. Jewish women weren't allowed to do. She divorced her husband an act which was against the Jewish law, which made it scandalous. So she was scandalous because she forsook her husband.

Right. Um, and, uh, and then, um, she married. Her husband's wife, excuse me. She, uh, Herod tpa married his brother's wife while his brother was still alive, which was also against Jewish law. So Herod, uh, had, had, uh, had had, you know, double and triple, uh, ways of, of [00:13:00] violating the, the morality of the Jewish people who he was called to live.

What he, what he had done in marrying his brother's wife while his brother was still alive was, was, uh, categorized as incest under Jewish law. So that's the background. John the Baptist, in his prophetic garb, uh, rallying the people, condemned their marriage publicly and as the leader of a huge political movement with, with his own disciples, John, the John the Baptist disciples, to survived Jesus' death.

You know, GE John was a threat internally to Herod tpa and also a Raus the fourth. Was a threat externally. So when all of this happened, uh, and the, the fear of herd tpa that is recorded by Josephus, the historian, was that John's movement might out become allies with a raid the fourth and bring down, uh, antipas dominions.

And so, according to [00:14:00] Josephus, and according to Mark anti PW had John the Baptist killed. And by the way, the rest of the story that we don't see in the gospel is a raid. The fourth ultimately did kill anti PW in 39, the year 39. So all of that's a backstory that we don't see much of from Mark. The folks of their time might have known all of that.

One of the things that's fascinating to me is how much this aligns. I think this is germane to our understanding. How much this aligns with another famous biblical story. I wanna remind you of King Ahab, the most evil of Jewish kings there ever was, and his wife Jezebel. Remember Jezebel, hopefully none of you will ever name your kids or grandkids or great-grandchildren, Jezebel, uh, she, she's the one who, who, uh, uh, was also a wife from another land.

It was another political marriage. King Ahab married, uh, a woman. Who, uh, who was the princess of Pson, and she brought with her the worship of Baal [00:15:00] and required the Jewish people to, uh, to, to worship Baal, uh, which angered Elijah and Jezebel very famously, with plot lines very much like the one we're seeing now.

Plotted to kill the prophet Elijah. Interesting, isn't it? So we have our story, John, uh, per tells us about this feast that happens. The, the Ian court is all gathered, uh, at, at one of, of, of Antipas, uh, fortresses. And we see there the nobles, uh, all of the nobles in the Noble family. We see. Uh, the, the Army officers, and then we see the, the leading merchants of Galilee, the, the inner circle of power, a grand feast attended only by the elite of the government and the military and the commercial interests that, uh.

Held the people of the land in, in subjugation. And then we see this story of, of, uh, a, a, a drunken, [00:16:00] uh, feast in which a dancing girl, uh, sexually arouses, um, um, uh. Herod tpa to the extent, uh, that he makes a promise. Now what's interesting is this, uh, that, that, that just shows the corruption of it all is that, uh, to Jews sensitivities, is that this dancing girl was simultaneously his niece and his daughter-in-law, and he so sexually aroused he'll give up his kingdom, uh, for whatever, and he, he offers her.

Uh, you know, whatever she asks. And, uh, she goes to her mama to find out what she should ask for. And of course, her mama says, I get John the Baptist head on a bladder. And absolutely absurd promise. Uh, that of course, uh, John makes, and in his, in his drunkenness, uh, uh, uh. Makes a promise that his honor requires him to fulfill, and so he does.

So, so what does all this mean? Well, I, I think there's a lot of, of, [00:17:00] of, uh, things that, that Mark is, you know, is doing here. Uh, all but the real question is why does he put it right? You know, why does he just sort of jam this story right in the middle of telling us about Jesus sending out his disciples and right before this feast out in the wilderness?

Well, the first thing I would say is that I think Jo Mark wants us to be shocked by the crass callousness of this scene, this, this cynicism of, of these elite in determining the fate of the people of the land. And the, and the leaders, the, the, those who are leading them, those who, who are calling the people to repent and to live in a more holy way.

Uh, there's a, a, a, a very strong, uh, biblical sense. Just like with, uh, you know, Ahab and Jezebel. You oppose power. Well, they can crush you without a second thought, oppose power, and you may have your head delivered to you on a power. On a silver platter, [00:18:00] uh, pose power and, uh, is what Mark is gonna ultimately tell us.

You may be nailed to a cross, but you gotta be willing to take up your cross. He's also going to tell us there's another, uh. Illusion. I think that we see here, you're familiar with the story of, of Pilate, uh, the Roman, uh, prelate, who will, uh, ultimately decide Jesus' fate. Uh, there's a contrast that's set up here.

If you, if you were to, if we were to tackle the plot lines here and, uh, you know, uh, leading to John the Baptizers, uh, uh, execution and, and you know, at the hands of Herod and follow those. Of, uh, leading up to Jesus's execution by Pilate, um, you'll, you would see really interesting parallels, uh, that, that that boom boom as though as though Mark very intentionally created, uh, parallel plot lines.

And, and, and one of the things that is, I think. Important here, uh, is, is just to notice in both of them there, there [00:19:00] is a, a character who, you know, is approximately responsible for the death of John the Baptizer in Jesus, you know, in, in, in this story, it's this. Dancing girl, this unnamed dancing girl. Uh, and, uh, she asked for his head, but of course, is she the one responsible or is Herod Antioch responsible for the execution of John the Baptizer?

And important to us is, well, who is it who asks for Jesus's head? Well, in the role of the dancing girl. You know, in, in that situation, it's the people of the land, the crowd, the people of the land, the poor. It, it was you and me who asked for Jesus' head. And the question of course is, well, who is responsible?

Is, is, is it Herod anti pilot dancing girl? Is the crowd responsible? Or Pilate? You know, Pilate wants to wash his hands of responsibility for Jesus' death, [00:20:00] but the blood was still in his hands, wasn't it? So that's that. Those are just a few comments. Uh, but I think the more important point here is that Mark is doing some foreshadowing.

This was John the Baptizers fate. This also will be the fate of the one who followed John the Baptizer, the one who was announced by Jam John the Baptizer, foreshadowing Jesus's fate. What I think is real interesting is, uh, as an aside, is this, is the, is the stark contrast you see of leadership, the leadership gathering in Washington.

I mean, I mean in, in, uh, Galilee, uh, uh, having this, uh. Drunken feast, uh, where they decide the fates of the peoples in, you know, with callous disregard and with the cynicism that, uh, that allows them to just dismiss the lives of, of any of them. Just, just on a such a silly, absurd promise, [00:21:00] uh, in contrast with the, the feast that Jesus is about to throw, the Eucharistic feast in which he will take bread.

Break it, bless it, and share it with all the people of the land showing us what true leadership does. And finally, I would say the, the, this story for Mark is, is in a very. Realistic way, naming the political destiny of all of those who proclaim repentance, who proclaim the new order that is breaking in this kingdom, and that that political destiny is always the same.

As we pick up Jesus's mission ourselves in our time, we inherit that destiny and that destiny is to be opposed. That destiny is to generate resistance. That [00:22:00] destiny is to be at risk, to have our heads handed to ourselves on a platter. This is something that I think we should not be surprised for, surprised by.

We, we see it in the Bible stories. We've seen it in our own American history of every single time we have a movement to become America. A movement that says we need to press forward and achieving the, the promises of our founding fathers, of the, of the people that we. That we will truly be a, a people governed by law.

That that treats all of us the same and gives us all equal opportunity. When, whenever we push against the, the, the, the inertia, uh, of, of, of the, of the status quo. We can expect there to be resistance. We can expect there to be feasts in Washington where. Folks callously disregard the, the people of the land and to determine their fate and, and, uh, and, and call up, uh, and use the [00:23:00] symbols of faith, uh, as, as, as, uh, as ways of, uh, of justifying the status quo.

While continuing to, um, leave the people of the land in subjugation. And whenever that happens, we can expect, uh, there to be, you know, incredible resistance. You know, you know, one person that I would bring to mind, uh, that knew this very clearly was Martin Luther King Jr. Who for five or six years saw our own government.

Uh, you know, eavesdropping, uh, tapping his, his phones, wherever he went, uh, you know, in, in, you know, in Stark, uh, you know, very, very deliberate opposition to his gospel message of, of equal opportunity for. For all Americans. Uh, and, and knowing that there was a target on his chest, that, that, in speaking many, many times, that he knew that he himself, uh, would someday be assassinated, but nonetheless [00:24:00] carrying forward, you know, with that mission then, uh, I think we need to, uh, today to, to hear and to hear that calling on the one hand and to be realistic a about that opposition.

Yet at the same time here it is good news because Mark doesn't just tell us this story. He tells us the one that follows it, which is that it, it is this following in Jesus way that causes our cups to overflow, that leads to the life that is true life, that leads to the life that is the way God. Always intended for us to live.

It is the life that is living, uh, that, that good, that causes us to have those relationships with each other, that our hearts yearn for, to have our relationship with God, that our hearts desire. And so the good news is that Jesus has shown us the path. Mark has reminded us that it's a tough path, but it is the path that leads to our [00:25:00] fulfillment nonetheless.

And so he's, he's pointed to the trailhead. For us folks, it's a tough trail ahead. I. It's the path to the good news in our lives. May we walk it with courage and continue to seek the justice that John the Baptist sought in his time, that Jesus sought in his time, that we are called to in Jesus' footsteps, to seek in our time.

In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
