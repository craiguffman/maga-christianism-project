# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 35

[00:00:00] Well, uh, good morning folks. Today we have one of those texts that preachers, uh, that in my experience, uh, usually avoid. Uh, it's one of those times when you, when you, you see this text coming up in the revised common electionary and you say, wow, this week I'm gonna preach the epistle or the Old Testament lesson.

And, and the reason for that is it has all this. Language in it that we would call apocalyptic, um, language like coming on the clouds in glory. And it's a text that's been so long misunderstood as a reference to the end times, uh, particularly in our. Very conservative, Protestant, uh, groups, uh, that have, have, uh, been, been prone to, um, antisemitism and supersessionism.

Um, that where, where, where the Old Testament is, is, uh, and sometimes not even printed in the Bible. So all you [00:01:00] have is the New Testament, uh, the, the thinking being. And this has been, uh, you know, the, the was known as the, uh, the, um. The heresy of Marcion, the Marcy United heresy, the idea that the whole Old Testament, uh, doesn't really belong with our, in our Bible.

And, and so for many Christian groups, uh, the Old Testament is unfamiliar, but, but I've often said to you, if you don't know the Old Testament, you have no hope. Of understanding much of the New Testament because it was holy scripture for Jesus and for Paul and for all of the apostles and so to understand, and this is one of those texts where that is particularly true, as you will see.

Uh, so, so one other thing I, as we get into it, I want to mention today, uh, we are going to be talking once more about, uh, the, the judgment. On the temple than the temple state. And I'm not gonna, uh, actually go into that much at all, but simply make an allusion to it. If, if you've not been [00:02:00] present over the last, uh, couple of sermons, I urge you to go listen to, uh, the last couple of ones on the podcast in which we.

We see Jesus condemning and, uh, the temple and we see him predicting its demise. So with that, let's, let's jump right in and talk and, and see what, what this has to do. This, this text says to us about what I want to call revolutionary. Patients in our call to be those who practice revolutionary patients.

And the story begins with a simple question. The, um, Jesus, uh, as, as, as I, um, alluded to and, and we read in the gospel lesson, uh, from the, from Halloween, uh, you know, predicts the destruction of the temple. Uh, and this evidently was, uh, on the Mount of Olives. So he had left the temple after, you know, as I said, playing all against all there.

Then and, and then, uh, he sat across from it on the Mount of Olives, uh, uh, looking overlooking the temple, [00:03:00] and he predicted its destruction. And then Peter, James, John, and Andrew, the original four, uh, say to him, ask him a, a, a really, uh. Rational question. Okay. Jesus, we, we hear what you're say and you say The temple's coming down.

Well, when will that happen? How, you know, what sign will show that all these things are about to come, uh, to an end? Uh, and, um. And this was, uh, it's an understandable concern of theirs because, uh, it's real important for us to remember that destruction of the temple for them would've meant the destruction of the entire world is all Jews understood that it was the very center of their life.

It was the source of their government. It was the source of their relationship with God, the location, uh, where they most practiced their relationship with God. So that for the temple to be destroyed. Would be, well, let's just say it would be like something happening in our country that would [00:04:00] completely destroy our democracy, the world that we, we know, the things that we simply presuppose is true, the givens of our lives and s place and supplanted it with something else.

Well, so they ask, Hey, what's this gonna happen? Simple question. And Jesus, uh, I, I really gotta to chuckle a little bit as I, as I've worked through this text. This last several weeks, um, he, he gives, uh, he's gonna give a, a, a warning against premature expectation. Um, and, and he is gonna say, watch out repeatedly.

You're gonna find in, in, uh, several verses, verse 9, 23 and 33. Jesus is gonna say the word, uh, um, you know, that, that we might translate is beware. Watch out, watch out, watch out. And he repeatedly calls us, uh, to discern. He calls us, he warns us against these superficial impressions of the fulfillment of time, which have [00:05:00] become an industry in our time.

Uh, you know, spawn a whole host of movies and books and things like that, all about the end times. And, and they're very superficial and Jesus warns us against them here. Now couple of things that that he's going to say here in this beginning, the very first thing Jesus has said is Watch out. This is only the beginning.

So the first watch out is this is only the beginning, so watch out for misinformation. Many Messianic leaders are going to arise, watch out that no one deceives you. Many people will come in my name and say, Hey, I am the one. I am the Messiah. And they will deceive many people. And he says, when you hear of wars and reports of wars, don't be alarmed.

These things must happen. But this isn't the end yet. And we know that what Jesus is talking about is not some something at the end of time. Some eschatological concern. He is not talking about something that that [00:06:00] did not, you know, for Meyer. Perspective in history hasn't happened yet. He's talking about the thing he'd been talking about for the last, that we've been talking about for the last three or four weeks that Jesus had been preaching about.

He's talking about the thing that was their, the question that they had asked. The temple, the temple is going to be destroyed. And what will lead up to it? That's what he's answering. One of the things I, that I always, I always laugh about is sometimes, sometimes people ask me a simple question. This will come as a surprise to you guys.

I know, uh, Charlie and Judy certainly will remember how the many times in Bible study where you, one of them would ask a real simple question and 15 minutes later, I'm getting down, I'm getting. You know, to the end of, you know, to, to the, to the final point of my answer. 'cause some things you can't answer with a simple question, uh, with a simple answer.

Some questions, uh, require you go grab this data point, this data point this data point this data point, weave them all together, and then, then the, the, the final answer can become clear, can become understood, and a [00:07:00] soundbite won't work. And that what we're gonna see here is Jesus is going to give a rather weaving answer.

We won't get to, we won't actually get. The answer to their question until verse 24 through through 27. But, but the first thing he says is, Hey, this is not this right now. You know, watch out because this is only the beginning. Lots of things are gonna happen. And this is what actually happened in the, in the lead up to the temple's destruction in 70 ad many Messianic leaders actually did arise between Jesus's ministry.

When Jesus died around 30 AD and the beginning of the Jewish War, which was from 66 to 70. Uh, and there, and there were, there were many people who claimed to be the, the Messiah. There was one called ISTs. There were, there were the two sons of the Judas, Judas of Galilee. I told you before. Four, that there was a guy in, in the year six when Jesus was a little boy who rose up.

He was Judas of Galilee and he, he let a tax revolt against the Romans. Well, so too did his sons, [00:08:00] and they were, they were also crucified. There was another guy called the Egyptian who had 2000 followers. Who led a rebellion and there were numerous others through the historian Joseph, his names as, uh, simply as the imposters.

Um, and the point I think that Jesus is making our takeaway here, I think, uh, really are twofold. That, that, that sometimes we have false impressions, uh, because. We inflict them upon ourselves. We naively read from world events and see in these world events and, and become panicked by these world events as, as signs of the end of things as we know them.

Uh, sometimes, however, uh, we have false impressions because they are deliberately cultivated by. Imposters who rise up, uh, those with something to gain, a way to merchandise off our fears, uh, uh, to manipulate our, the masses and gain power. Uh, you, you know all about [00:09:00] that. We have seen that in our lifetimes and we disciples, Jesus is saying, are vulnerable to both kinds of misinformation.

So he says, watch out for misinformation. And then Jesus talks about, uh, what we should expect to see. Uh, nations and kingdoms will fight against each other, and there will be earthquakes and famines in all sorts of places. Jesus says these things are just the beginning of the sufferings associated with.

The end. The end of what? The end of the temple. So he's saying, you know, uh, things, he's predicting things that actually happened. We know that after Jesus died, there were a lot of wars that would've panicked the people, potentially the Parton war, the Roman Empire, the Romans empire, uh, empire, uh, had had a, a tremendous battle with the Parthians, uh, in, in 36, and some sporadic wars arose between Herod.

Who's gonna get killed in 44? And the Nae king array us, [00:10:00] uh, that they, they went to war in the year 37. So just seven years after Jesus died right there in Galilee. And there were a series of local uprisings, a series of tax revolts that the Romans put down in the years before the war. And then. At the time that we believe Mark was writing his gospel, there was the Roman Civil War that began in 68.

I mean, so, so first of all, there was the Jewish War with Rome. And in right at the midpoint of that, there was a, a civil war within Rome, uh, that happened in Rome. That, that led to, and I'll talk about this later, led to four successive emperors within one year. Uh, there were also earthquakes, uh, that Mark would've, his audience would've known about.

There was an, uh, there was actually an earthquake in 67. There was a severe one in Palestine and Philippi just before that, uh, there was the destruction of Pompeii. You will remember in the year 62, and there was a, another severe tur, uh, earthquake in the area that we would today call Turkey, uh, in [00:11:00] 61. And there was a major famine in the year 46 that throughout the Roman Empire.

So, so Jesus is saying. These things, uh, are part of life. Uh, don't misread wars and natural disasters don't be confused. Wars and na and natural disasters are part of human life. They're part of our fallen condition and they are to be expected. They are not a sign of the end. And I say this is very important to us to hear because we have lots of Christian prognosticators who will look at any sort of thing arising and predict that it's the end of the world coming.

And Jesus saying very clarity to us. Don't be deceived. These things show that a new beginning is coming. They are birth pangs of the new world. God is ushering, ushering in. Uh, they do not tell us when it is coming. They just simply signal that the creation is groaning, uh, groaning towards its fulfillment.

Uh, but they don't tell us. They don't give us any, any data about when that's going to come to [00:12:00] pass. And then Jesus says, um, watch out. Second watch in verse nine, watch out. Uh, and he, and he says, watch out because first things must happen. Meaning before the end comes, there are certain things that must happen.

And he, and he says, well, watch out for, for yourself. People will hand you over to the councils, uh, to the Sanhedrin, uh, throughout the lands there were. There was the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, but there were Sanhedrin throughout, uh, Jewish, uh, occupied lands that, that were served as, as little civil courts.

And, and, and, and they will, uh, you will be beaten in the synagogues. Jesus, uh, foretells you will stand before governors and kings, uh, because of me. So. That you can testify before them, and so that he concludes first. That's what must happen. The good news must be proclaimed to all the nations. In other words, Jesus is saying, [00:13:00] disciples must be patient.

I. Don't be misled first, the gospel must be proclaimed to the ends of the earth through your witness. So that has to happen before God will bring about the temple's, uh, destruction, uh, and that you are doing, that your, your role disciples in, in, in other words, our role as disciples in proclaiming, uh, the gospel is hard enough.

Don't be distracted. Don't take sides. Don't fight with the Romans, and don't fight with the revolutionaries. Rather practice revolutionary patience. Be patient. Don't be distracted by anxiety about the end of the world as you know it. Jesus says that, um, you're gonna be hated by all people. He talks about when they, they haul you in and hand you over.

Don't worry ahead of time about what to answer or say. You know, one of the things that, uh, you know, people always insert here, [00:14:00] uh, you know, he says that the, the, that the Holy Spirit, uh, is going to give you. Uh, what you need to say at the moment. Uh, there's a, there's a big caveat here that this doesn't apply to preachers.

You know, we actually do have to prepare. The Holy Spirit is gonna just give us a word if we don't prepare. Uh, but, but the warning that Jesus is, is giving us is, is that, uh, a father will turn in his children, children will rise up against their parents and have them Mexican. This actually happened, uh, the warning that that three Christians, that those early disciples would be hated by all people was actually.

Dramatically fulfilled a generation later when in Rome itself, Christians were viciously persecuted by Nero. That's the context of, uh, the epistle to Rome is, is the persecution of, uh, you know, of Christians by. Um, by Nero, uh, and, and, and, and what was said about Christians. Well, uh, Nero justified the persecution, uh, and, and the people justified it, uh, uh, by the fact, by naming [00:15:00] Christians as notoriously depraved and naming Christians as holding to a deadly superstition.

And so, uh, what Jesus predicted, uh, came about, uh, in the fifties and, and, and beyond. But then Jesus says something very important, but through all of this. This is gonna happen before anything happens. Those who stand firm in the faith will be saved. Now this isn't, uh, the word that's used here to be saved is not talking about eternal salvation.

It's, it's the sense of the word that, that we would use today. You know, as I, if I were to, as if I were to. Be saved from, um, demise from COVID-19. I would be protected. I would, I would live under God's protection. So whoever stands firm as we go about and aren't distracted, God's word is not gonna return empty.

We will be protected. That's his promise. The important point is for us not to be distracted, [00:16:00] but to practice this revolutionary. Patience. And that brings me to, to, to a point that I think is real important that Jesus is, is, has been teaching and is in and will teach. One of my, one of my mentors, uh, is, is a theologian named Stanley Haras.

I mentioned him a lot to you guys. Um, and one of the things he always would say is that, uh, the, the task of the church is to be the church. The task of the church. Uh, and, and, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer with, with Hawa, both, they both said this, uh, the task of the church is to teach the world. The task of disciples is to teach the world that the world is the world.

That the world is not the kingdom of God. That, that the, the world is different. So biblically, when we speak of world, it's, it's, uh. It's the lives that we lead that are, uh, that are profane, that are not, uh, uh, those moments when we are not, um, ruled by God when, when God does not reign in our hearts. And so we will and, and [00:17:00] do that which God does not will for us to do well then that when, when we live in those moments, uh, we are.

Of the world. We are living in a worldly way. That's the biblical understanding of this. And so, so, so what what, what I was taught by Stanley Haras and by Dietrich Bonhoeffer is, is that our task is to teach the world that it is the world. It's, it's, it's, you know, the task of disciples is to be, to incarnate the good news, to teach the world that it is the world by being something different by, by living in.

Such a holy fellowship with God and such a holy fellowship with each other, that the world learns by our example, that it is not within the kingdom of God, but outside of it, and is thereby drawn into that way of living, seeing the joy and the peace that we manifest. And so the our task is to practice this.

Revolutionary patience and not go crazy. Get not [00:18:00] get sucked in to the battles, not get sucked in, to rise above it and just focus on our task of, of simply worshiping God. That's, uh, what I think Jesus is, is saying here when he, when he calls us to practice this revolutionary patience. And then, and then Jesus pivots.

So he's, he's been peeling his apple as he's answering their question. You know, he is about halfway through and now he's gonna pivot. He, he said, watch out. It's just the beginning. Be careful for these things. And now he's gonna pivot here. And he says, but it's gonna get ugly folks, so watch out when you see certain things.

It's getting really close. And so he talks about, uh. This, this point, uh, where there will be a time for all of us to evacuate. Something is going to happen that will signify that it is time for disciples to run, to run, uh, without looking back, to run, without picking up our belongings to flee so quickly that even those with [00:19:00] children will have difficulty keeping it up and, and, uh, keeping up.

And, and that's the moment when a disaster is coming upon Judea. That will make all the previous woes of the world and all that will ever be look tame by comparison. And that's what we saw. That's what we saw happening in history. Jesus foretold it and. The disciples to whom, uh, mark was writing the, the, the Christians that, that were part of the marking communities, um, they actually saw this transpire, uh, the siege of Jerusalem, the siege of siege of Jerusalem.

Joseph, Joseph, uh, Josephus. The historian tells us that during that siege. Uh, people starved and, and forgive me, of being so graphic as saying something that's gonna turn your stomach, but people were so hungry that they ate their own babies to stay alive. They [00:20:00] fought each other both for scraps of dirty food, and also they fought each other for really small scale, uh, status gains, uh, within the.

The, you know, the factional fighting, as I told you, there were like four warlords that arose among the Jews, each, each competing for power in Jerusalem. And, and Jesus clearly wanted the disciples at that point to get out to run. 'cause such a time as that was not a time for some sort of misguided, uh, nationalism, uh, some sort of misguided.

Patriotism, uh, staying to the bitter end at that time would not serve their purpose, which is to be, uh, the living, his living hands to carry on his message. And so he says, when you see the disgusting and destructive thing standing where it shouldn't be, and then Mark inserts a per, uh, a, a parenthetical statement here.

Here he says, he says in, he's sort of a, like an [00:21:00] aside, a stage whisper. The reader should understand this. As, as though you should get this thing I'm about to say, you know, when you see the disgusting and destructive thing standing where it shouldn't be, well then that's the time that those in Judea must escape to the mountains.

You know? And and scholars have often wondered what Jesus was talking about when he said, when you see the disgusting and. Destructive thing, standing where it shouldn't be. The reader should understand this. Uh, and there's an awful lot of, of wonder about how that came to pass a lot of theories. My, the one that I find most, most compelling is something that happened in the year 67, in the midst of the Jewish war against Rome, while they were waiting, um, for the, uh, the army of Ian, uh, to descend upon them and later Titus to come and destroy, uh, Jerusalem.

Sometime between 67 and the spring of 68, um, a group [00:22:00] of what we call zealots took over the temple. They, they, they won their faction, uh, for a time, won the battle for Jerusalem among all the other factions of Jews fighting for it. And they took over the temple and they allowed criminals. To roam the temple, they allowed criminals to go into the Holy of Holies, which no one was allowed to go to, as you know.

But one priest, and even to murder people, they allowed criminals to murder others in the temple. This was a, uh, a destructive desecration of the temple, and they, they named a sick, uh, they did sort of a sick joke, uh, as one, one scholar put it, uh, by naming a, a, a, a completely unsavory character named Fannie, uh, as the high.

Priest. So they, they took the, they took the, the high priest to, uh, who was the reigning one, uh, murdered him and put in his place this clown character. And, and so that, so many scholars point to that as the time that Jesus was talking about. Jesus says, [00:23:00] in those days when you see that happening, uh, there will be great suffering, such as the world has never seen before, and we'll never see again.

And, uh, and he, and he says something pretty important here. He says that, um, if, you know, don't be too afraid. 'cause the Lord is going to shorten that time. Uh, 'cause if he didn't shorten that time, uh, the siege lasted five months. So, so Jesus is saying that God is gonna shorten the time of this, uh, horrendous event, uh, because if he didn't, no one would be rescued.

But for the sake of his electors, for the sake of the faithful ones, he will shorten it. He will shorten the time so that they might be preserved. And, and, and Jesus says, well, um, that will also be a time when Deceivers are gonna run riot, and they're gonna leave folks astray. They're gonna say, uh, to, you know, over here, this one is our, uh, Uber bench.

This is the one that we should follow. He's the one that will [00:24:00] defend us. He's the one that will protect us, will speak for us. Don't believe it. Jesus says. False Christ and false prophets will appear and they will offer signs and wonders in order to deceive, uh, if possible, those whom God is called into the way of love.

And he says, but you watch out, watch out. Be aware. Be alert. I've told you everything ahead of time.

Many prophets did arise during the Roman Jewish war, uh, between 66 and 70, and they offered rescue, uh, they tried to gain a following and, and did gather followings. Uh, and they promised all sorts of signs and wonders, but that all came to nothing. And Jesus says, but he pivots. Now he's gonna pivot a third time and he's gonna say, but understand when that comes.

Now Jesus is, is going to explain, uh, what, what it all means. The meaning of the [00:25:00] temple coming down, he says. But in those days then. Then he gives us this apocalyptic language that you've heard before. Uh, that causes many preachers to skip this text when it comes up in our electionary. Uh, uh, if you don't know the Old Testament, you don't realize that Jesus is quoting a variety of Old Testament prophets in texts, uh, from Isaiah and Jeremiah and others.

But most particularly from Daniel, that passage, which Tom read us today, uh, and, and, and, and the language that that, that we see in chapter 24 through 27, that comes directly from Daniel. Uh, and so that's what we see the story of the ancient one, who is the father who, who, who, who, uh, comes and is holding court.

He, he gathers all the beasts of the lands together and he judges them. And so, uh, I, I. To, to start in the middle of that verse 10, where it talks about, uh, [00:26:00] you know, the, the ancient one is there, the court is in session, and then the judgment began. And Daniel, the one who's the author of, of this vision, uh, says, I kept watching.

I watched from the moment the horn started bragging until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed. Then the authority of the remaining beasts was brought to an end, but they were given an extension among the living Forset time and season. Now, uh, it was very well known that the, that the beast, the four beasts who, who, who were destroyed were, were the, the, the beasts that had had, uh.

And ruled over Israel. You know, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Greeks, and the one that had given an extended time were the Romans and, uh, in Daniel's vision. Uh, and, uh, and so he says that, that he kept watching. And what we see then is, uh. Uh, is is Jesus quoting this text. 'cause he says in those days after the suffering of that time, [00:27:00] the sun will become dark and the moon won't give its light.

This is language that's apocalyptic that we see in the lots of, of, of places, but it's the setup is to the time when the ancient one comes, it's denouncing the coming of God and the court is in session. The scars will fall from the sky, the planets, and other heavenly bodies will be shaken. This is. The world, the shaking of the foundations of the world by the Inan folks in the year 69, 1 Roman Emperor after another.

Um, uh. Succeeded. Another. There were four, there was Nero, there was Otho, there was Vitalis. There was s uh, Sian. Sian was the general who had been, who had been prosecuting, uh, the, the, the Jewish war. Uh, when, when he saw that there was a civil war, he was. He, he was coming to end it all. And then right in the midst of it, the Civil War in 69 happened.

And, and he left his army there, went back to [00:28:00] Rome, became emperor himself, and then sent his adopted son Titus, as the general, who then is the one who destroyed Rome. But during that time, there was violence, there was murder, there was civil war. Uh, and what happened then was that, uh, Titus entered Jerusalem.

Titus burnt the temple. They melted. Uh, they, they, they lit fires, uh, so that the gold would melt and they would be able to extract gold from the temple. And he completely destroyed the, the temple in, uh, in the city. And he crucified thousands and thousands of Jews over the course of five months. And. The important point I think that Jesus is saying here as he, as he continues by quoting the prophet Daniel, is if you know the prophet Daniel, what you know is this is not what it may appear to be.

This is not the end of the world as you know it. No, it is God bringing about God's judgment. Ancient one. The court is in session. [00:29:00] This is the beginning of that, the temple state. Which was intended for the good, but which had been co-opted by greedy men, by the, by the, the, by the elite wealthy oligarchic families, and was no longer manifesting the God, the, the good that God intended for the people of the lands.

Uh. That will be destroyed. This is what Jesus has said, but he said this by quoting Daniel. He's saying, this isn't the end of the world but salvation. Because what happens immediately after is Tom read to us this, this discussion is that the, that, that they will see the human one coming in clouds with great splendor.

Now notice something here. If you've ever heard of something called the second coming, people envision the second coming as, as Jesus coming to earth. Well, in this section of Mark, that's not what is being said here at all. 'cause he's quoting the book of Daniel. The Coming and Clouds is not to earth. The [00:30:00] Perusia is not about Jesus appearing again on Earth, but rather it's about Jesus ascending to sit at the right hand of the Father.

It's about enthronement, it's about him becoming and declared throne. And that's what Tom. Just read to us. So he continued. Daniel says, as I continued to watch this night vision of mine, I suddenly saw one, like a human coming with the heavenly cloud. So he, where is he coming? He's coming to the celestial court, the heavenly courts, where the ancient one is sitting, sitting in his, judging the empires of the world, right?

And he came to the ancient one, uh, and was presented before him. Rule. Glory and kingship were given to him, and all people's nations and languages will serve him. His rule is an everlasting one. It will never pass away his kingdom. Is indestructible. So the temple [00:31:00] destruction is not the end of the world, but God's judgment, that must happen.

This must happen. Why? So that the Messiah will take its place, the temple state's place, the corrupted temple state's place, and bring about the day of the world. Make the world right. Again. It is, in other words. The new beginning that God had always promised, had repeatedly promised through the prophets.

And that's what, uh, Jesus then quotes or alludes to one of the, this appears many places, but it, it appears in the section in from Isaiah that Mary Joe read to us this morning. Uh, Jesus says, then he will send the angels. This, this is the Messiah. We'll send the angels, the human one will, and we'll gather together his chosen people from the four corners of the earth, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.

And that's, uh, that's the, the good news, the from the gospel of Isaiah, where, where you heard Mary, Mary Jo say, you know, from the prophet, God [00:32:00] speaking, don't fear, don't fear. This means that I am with you and from the east I'll bring your children from the west. I'll gather you, I'll say to the north, give them back into the south.

Don't detain them. Bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth. Everyone who is called by my name. My daughters from the end of their, everyone is called by my name and whom I created for my glory, whom I have formed and made all will be gathered, and who's to do that gathering.

That gathering is, you know, to be done by, by the word Angelos, which means the messengers. It's, it's done, it's, it's, it's to be done by those who Jesus sends out to gather to be done by. You and I, we are to be gathering from the ends of the earth all into this fellowship. And folks, I think this brings us to some understanding of how this story of the.

Temple's destruction is [00:33:00] actually something for us that is good news. Several points. I, I think that, uh, we, we can, uh, draw from this. First of all, we need to understand Jesus' teaching is that bad things are going to happen. You may feel that this thing that has happened to you is the end of the world as you know it.

You may feel that is, that it is, uh, that all life has been turned upside down and you will never survive it. But Jesus is saying, don't be misled. Don't be distracted from your mission. No matter what is happening to us, you have a mission and that is to embody the God. Uh, the good news there is, there is nothing that should prevent you from being able to do that no matter what happens to you.

Understand that don't be distracted for your task is clear. You are to live the good news, to proclaim the kingdom by the way you live so that the world learns that it is the world. Is drawn into the kingdom [00:34:00] of God, drawn into the reign of God. So when the world is turned upside down, Jesus is telling us it's not a sign of the end of our lives.

It's not the sign of the end of the world. It's not, it's not a, it's not a sign. We will no longer be able to flourish. Rather, it's a sign of the new beginning for you that is on its way. So Jesus says, real simply, I think do not fear, watch out, but do not fear for God is in charge. God is in charge, so be still and know that I'm God.

I think this is the gospel that we should hear again and again. It's the gospel that we are to embody. It's the gospel that I hope will calm your heart if it needs calming on this day. And the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
