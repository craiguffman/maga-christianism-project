# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 32

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we continue in our journey, uh, doing a close reading of the Gospel of Mark. Uh, as, uh, I'll remind you once again and today this is a particularly important reminder that we are seeking to understand Mark's gospel, uh, you know, as the. As the artist, as the work of the artist that Mark is.

And so therefore we're reading it literarily. And today that's quite germane because Mark does some, uh, some really interesting literary, uh, artwork today. And, uh, I wanna spend some time working, walking us through it because, uh, this is one of those passages that's, that is so familiar to us and the ones that has been so threatening to us, uh, over the centuries.

We've done our best to domesticate something that I think is quite a compelling message for us to hear, uh, in every time, but particularly in our time. And I wanna remind you of two contexts as we begin. One is the context of Mark's [00:01:00] audience. If you recall, they were a people. Of Jewish Christians who were awaiting the destruction, anticipating the destruction of Jerusalem, the temple at Jerusalem.

Uh, they were expecting persecution because of a tax revolt that had begun, uh, and, and led it to the Jewish war. Uh, that was, that happened between 66 in our common era and 70. And the other context is our own context today. Uh, you, you take a pick of how you wanna describe it. I've, uh, done an awful lot of descriptions in the podcast, uh, that, uh, that some of you have listened to, uh, in, which is, uh.

Has, has traced our own racialized history here in America. But I, but the other part of our context is what's happening in Congress right now as we decide whether or not we are gonna fund certain initiatives, uh, that aim at, uh, helping the poor and dealing with climate and those types of things. And as we struggle to make sense of how we might do and what we might do that would ask [00:02:00] us to hold all of that as part of the backdrop of the word that God is speaking to us today through this passage.

So let's just remind ourselves also of what happened last week, uh, because that's important. This, uh, this story here, mark is put, uh, as, uh, as the next thing that happened after what happened last week. So last week we saw Jesus arriving from, uh, you know, ascending the Mount of Olives, ascending the Mount of of Jerusalem.

And, uh. Cursing a fig tree that, uh, uh, was not bearing fruit in its proper season. And, uh, uh, and then, and then particularly, uh, performing street theater, uh, in the temple, uh, where he, uh, started, uh, as I say, redirecting traffic in the temple as though, uh, as though he were as, as t Wright put it as though he were a policeman.

Uh, who had, uh, just a regular civilian who just sort of stood up and started directing traffic, getting traffic, uh, going in the right patterns. Uh, when the people who were supposed to do that, the policemen in uniform had not [00:03:00] done it properly. So Jesus acted with the authority of the king and with the authority of the high priests.

And that's what brings about the. Conflict that we're going to see today. And our today, our topic has to do with, uh, political authority and accountability. So, uh, this week, uh, we're going to see something artistically that is called a, a, an intercalation. It's another one of those literary devices that I've called a sandwich device.

And I wanna remind you, that means that you have, uh, three. Typically three, uh, vignettes, sometimes stories. In this case, we have two controversies about authority. Uh, that, uh, sandwich something in between. In this case, this is a, a parable in between and, and the artistic device that was commonly done, it's done in market, but it was done in his era, uh, both biblically and extra biblically.

Uh, it, it, you know, we understood, we can understand what it means. We are to look at the. The two layers and help us to understand what [00:04:00] the meaning of the center is and where to look at the meat that's in the center in order to understand the meaning of the layers on the outside. So, uh, one of the ways that we know that Mark is doing this is that he took great care to present two controversies over the same topic of, you know, of authority with, with exactly the same structures.

And so you'll note as we go through them. Uh, that, you know, both of them have the same plot. Uh, Jesus' opponents approach him. They challenge his authority. Jesus responds to them with a, a rabbinical technique that's known as a counter question, which was very common and still very common in our era. And then his opponents respond to his counter question, and then Jesus.

Uh, uh, nails them, uh, with his own response that is based upon them entrapping themselves with the answer to his question. So Mark does this in two controversies. In the middle of it, he has this parable of, uh, of the vineyard that we're going to deal, uh, drill into, uh, today. I need [00:05:00] to give you some background for us to understand this.

Uh, so I wanna re rehearse some, uh, historical background, some of which I think you may be familiar, some of which you may not, but it's pretty crucial for our understanding today. So I wanna remind you first of, of the pol, the history of the political authority. And at Palestine. The question that is presented today is about.

Whose authority are you speaking? Well, that was a, a question that had a history. So if you think about American history, you know, we go back, you know, uh, almost 250 years, not quite 250 years as a country. And so, but we, when we think of our history, we will tend to make reference to things that happened, you know, 250 to, uh, to 150 years ago, whether we're quoting the, the articles, you know, our, our, our, um, Bible of America.

Culture, which is that, you know, I would say would be, it would include the works. You know, our canon would include the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. And then, or we might move, we might, uh, move forward to things that happened, uh, after our civil war. And, and certainly we would, [00:06:00] we would remind ourselves of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address and include that in our canon and our, and our way of understanding ourselves.

Well. That, that I wanna remind you that that's not just us who, who, who do that. Uh, uh, the, the Jews also did that. And, and so they constantly referred to things that happened in their past 200 years. And so let's look at that. So we, we were quite familiar with the fact that the Jews had been in exile and deliberate from exile, and that Cyrus helped them rebuild the temple.

We talked about that last week. What we haven't spoken a lot about, about, about is the fact that around 3 33, uh, Alexander the greats, uh, Greek Empire arose, he conquered everything, uh, Egypt and, and, and, and certainly what the land that we now call Palestine. Uh, and, and, and from that point on, the Jews were, uh, under someone else's rule.

Uh, uh, we'll skip a lot of what happened under Alexander and his generals and, and go straight to the period around 200. Before the common era and where you get the Seid rule, [00:07:00] which were one of the, uh, two Greek houses that were competing for power, uh, in the, you know, the global, uh, they were the global powers, the ese who, who really, uh, had their, their, um, uh.

Point of power, their sphere of power being Africa, and the CIDs who had their point of power being Antioch and the Mediterranean, the CIDs, uh, dominated, uh, the area that we're talking about and ruled. And for the most part, they allowed the Jews to, uh, rule themselves without, uh, interfering too much until the period, uh, of, of, of Andy ais epiphany.

Now, I've mentioned him several times. Whenever we speak of the book of Daniel, we have to speak of him. 'cause although the book of Daniel, uh, presents itself. Is a story about the Jews going into exiled Babylon in, you know, 5 87. It is actually a book that was written, uh, as uh, what's known as an apocrypha.

It's literary genre is apocrypha. So it's telling a past story in order to speak to the [00:08:00] present, which is exactly what Mark is doing here. Uh, but in this case, the threat that was Antioch's epiphanies. He was the new cell as, uh. King, uh, who, uh, began to persecute the Jews and around 186, excuse me, 168, during, in the common era before the common era, uh, he, um, did all sorts of things that, uh, was so oppressive, uh, that it, it, uh, caused an uprising among the Jews.

Now, the Book of Daniels, I said, uh, takes this, uh, story. It's cause it's presenting cause for the book because it's, you know, in a, a, a book that is in the, the genre of apocrypha is trying to tell the people to its purpose is to say that people persist, persevere, uh, remember the stories of our past. You can survive this if we simply stay faithful.

Uh, and what were the things that Antiochus was doing? Well, uh, one, the first thing he did was he took, uh, he had his soldiers take all the wealth, all the gold, all of the, the [00:09:00] riches of the second temple, uh, and, uh, and, and use it to finance his armies. Uh, he did, he garrisoned troops on the Holy Mountain of Jerusalem.

Uh, which as you can imagine, if someone did that in Washington, if the Chinese did that or the Russians did that in Washington, we would have a. Constant reminder of the fact that we were occupied as, as Union soldiers did that in the South, it was a constant reminder that the south was, uh, occupied and there, and, and there, there arises from that, a deep, deep resentment and urgency in getting those soldiers removed.

And we've seen that so thing ourselves when we have occupied other nations. Most recently, Afghanistan. So what did you get that sense of, of resentment? That was festering here. And then, and then he, he banned the practice of, of the Jewish visible, uh, practices of their faith in particular, uh, the right of circumcision and banding all practice of the Sabbath.

So that had to go underground as you speak. And then he, he required. He [00:10:00] established in the temple, uh, an altar of Zeus, and he and he very famously sacrificed a pig profaning that temple. As I mentioned to you last week, this brought about the Maccabean Revolt in 164 bc. Now, I wanna mention this as a political point.

That at that point, this, this was a, a group of people, the Maccabees were people in their origins who were. Deeply conservative Jews and, and I say conservative in the sense of faithful, uh, biblical, wanting to live according to Torah. And this was the origin of the political party that we grew, that we came to know as the Pharisees and that in, so in 164, the Maccabeus brothers, uh, were able to throw off the cell acid.

And establish a, uh, you know, rule themselves. They cleanse the principle for a while. It's about six or seven years. Uh, they were, they had free rule and then, uh, and then the Greeks overcame them, but allowed them to, uh, they negotiated with the, with the Maccabees and allowed them to [00:11:00] continue to rule. So what we have then was the establishment of the Hassan Dynasty and the Hassan Dynasty consisted of the family of the, um.

Of the Maccabees, and we just read to you, uh, the, the writing of the great hero, Matthias Maccabee, who was the, the leader of the revolt. And, and those words were his words on his deathbed, uh, bequeathing, a certain kind of authority. The important point was the Hassim and Dynasty, uh, sort of decayed from its uh, uh, revolutionary years.

As it became, uh, wealthy and, and accommodated, uh, Greek Way and became, uh, those who enjoy the benefits of that. And so they lost their purity, so to speak. Now, I, I, as an analogy, I would bring in, uh, as a point, uh, our own. We often talk here in the United States of our most recent history, the Reagan Revolution, and we have a thing happening in our own country where there were.

Curist, if you will. Uh, and there were marks of purity [00:12:00] that you were a follower, the Reagan revolution. And then now we're seeing those who are saying you're Republican in name only because you're not adhering to those original rules. Well, that's what sort of happened in, in Jewish history, where the, the Ians brought about a rise of a new party called the Sadducees, which ended up being the ruling party.

And these were the ones who. Accommodated the culture. They didn't maintain the purity of the original Maccabean revolution. And so the Pharisees who were originally were, you know, the political party that that sort of won, they were the revolutionary political party. They become, they became the opposition party.

And in another group who had relation with the Pharisees said, Hey, we're done with this. These guys are imposters. You see the hasson declared themselves the, the, the, uh, the chief priests of the temple. And, uh, and, uh, they were not of the family of Aaron. And of course, Jewish law said that, uh, the, the, to be the chief [00:13:00] priest, you had to be, to be a priest at all.

You had to be of the family of Aaron. And, uh, and so the, the Senes completely departed and established a new, uh. Jewish way of living in the desert. That's where we get the Dead Sea Scrolls from that people, well, the Pharisees also po themselves as the friendly opposition, if you will. And so that's how we developed that, that history.

So, but the Hessians established for the first time, uh, an inherited incumbency and that we have this idea of the priest prince in know, the chief priests and their families, these oligarchy who would rule, and it, and it was stated in an important way. They, they, they didn't have a permanent. Rule on the throne of David.

They were sort of the temporary, uh, incumbents of it until something called an accredited prophet would arise. And that was the way they pacified the Farris. You say, no, no, no, we're just gonna, we're just gonna, uh, stay on throne until someone arises who is a proper prophet, uh, which is germane to our story today.

One of the important things as a [00:14:00] backdrop is that they also negotiated an exemption from all the, the tributes, uh, from the, um, the Greeks. So that all worked. Pretty fine until the SE said Empire was conquered by the Roman Empire in about 63. And Mark Anthony ultimately, uh, did away with them entirely. He tried to put 'em up as puppets.

They didn't cooperate, so he just got rid of the Hass Romanians in entirely and put someone who was Ian, who, in other words, who was not Jewish at all, uh, on the throne Hart, uh, who was a Roman citizen. And, uh, was, uh, but what you and I would call a Saudi Arabian today, you know, he was from that territory.

He was, he was from the, the family that was descended, not of Jacob, but of his brother Esau. Right. So he was not Jewish at all, and he became the priest, prince oversight, overseeing the temple. And so did his dynasty. So that, that guy was Herod the Great, and of course he rebuilt the great temple that began construction in 19 before the common area, and ended right at the beginning of the Jewish, uh, [00:15:00] war, uh, meaning the com the, the temple was finally completed the year before the war began.

He. So we saw this, uh, working just fine until, uh, Herod died. Uh, and, and the Romans put up with his, his, uh, children, uh, a little while. And in, in six, uh, in the common era, uh, they said, enough is enough. These guys are not as good as their father. And so they established, uh, uh, some of the sons as. Puppets in Galilee and, uh, you know, Philip, uh, in, in, in, in other parts.

So they divided it into four parts. And Jerusalem themselves, they, they ruled by a procurator and they let the high priest, uh, govern the temple in collaboration with them. And that worked fine until. Uh, the Romans said, enough is enough. This system isn't working. And they just established direct Roman rule in 44.

So after Jesus was crucified, uh, and before the temple fell, the Romans had done away with all of this, and were just directly ruling it with their own [00:16:00] senators. All important to our story because this is our story today is one about taxes, taxes and power. So I, I, I mentioned that, that, that Herod the great, and, and his successors had given a golden era in which the oppressive tax that signified that you were, uh, you were among the people who were not Roman, but you were, uh, governed by them, oppressed by them.

It was called the, the, the, the poll tax or the census tax. And, and Herod negotiated because Herod was a, a citizen. He, he negotiated an exemption from this very oppressive tax and almost all the taxes, uh, the tax, the Romans called it Tribu. That's where we get the word tribute from. And it, and it, and it was paid only by those who were not Roman citizens.

And the Romans reins, reins instituted it in six ce. And, uh, when they did that, that brought about immediately a revolt in Galilee, a very famous revolt led by Judas of Galilee. And that's the one I've told you about several times where Jesus would've grown up seeing this when he was about 10 years old.

He would've walked to the, the [00:17:00] local market and seeing 2000 Galileans crucified, uh, who were part of Judas, Judas of Glee's Tax Revolt in six bc uh, uh, ce and um. Who the Romans, when they put it down, they, they, they crucified them. Uh, so the, so the tribute was a very much a controversial part of an and sign of Roman oppression.

And, and it divided people in, uh, within who were Jews, uh, uh, on the basis of how they supported that tax and, uh, and how faithful they were to the law. For a brief period, the Romans exempted her Agrippa for, you know, and then when they, once they took over and just ruled themselves, they reinstituted it once again.

So you can see it's being instituted, not being taken away, and then being instituted, you're talking about taxes that were tax load on the poor. That ended up being about 50% when you included the [00:18:00] tribute paid to Rome. The tribute paid to Rome's puppets. And then, uh, the tolls and, and, and such customs fees that they had to pay just going from city to city.

Um, uh, so it was, it was something that would, uh, the taxes themselves would put the poor into, uh, the status of day labors. They, it would drive them off the land. So this was a, a real. Painful, painful aspect of Jewish life that was very controversial in which Jesus had to deal with. The Roman tax revolts, uh, cont were continuous over this period, and as I said, they led to the Jewish revolt.

That was the, the problem that Mark was addressing. In, in, as he wrote in about between 66 and 70, uh, in the common era. So with that background, I want you to hear with me and go over these, the sandwich that Mark has presented, the first controversy, then the parable, and then we'll talk about the second controversy.

And then we'll come back and say, well, how does, how [00:19:00] does the outer layers help us understand the parable that Jesus said teach? And, and very briefly, what does this say to us today? Um, so one of the things I, I. To bring out to you is the very first sentence. Let's not overlook that Jesus and his disciples inner Jerusalem again, and Jesus was walking around the temple as he was walking around the temple.

Again, this would've been like the second day, uh uh, a, a certain group that's described. Now look at the, this group here, the chief priests, the legal experts in the elders. Now, who is that group? This, these are not all Jews. This is a representative, uh, uh, group. And in fact, this is the group who constituted the group that we call the Sanhedrin, the Council of Elders was dominated.

This was the one that governed the Jews, uh, on behalf of the Roman oppressors. Uh, and on behalf of the chief priest, it was, it was, it was, uh, sort of like the speaker of the house who sort of runs the house. Well, this would've been the. You know, like a delegation from the Sanhedrin here that's being described.

So there are the powers whose nose Jesus had just [00:20:00] tweaked. They're sent out by the Sanhedrin to say, what the hell? In other words, they asked, what kind of authority do you have for doing those things you just did? And the references here is very clearly his, his parade from the Mount of Olives into Jerusalem.

His entry into the temple and, and his street theater in the temple. And he, and they say, what, who gave you this authority to do these things? And, and the question of course is, is, uh, is not an innocent one because the, the, the implied question is, we know we didn't give you the authority. So who the heck you think you are?

And that's, uh, the, the, uh, the opening of, of the gauntlet. And Jesus, uh, says, I have a question for you. Give me an answer, then I'll tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things. So the counterpart, the rabbinic, uh, debate, you know, a counter question, answering a question with a question, something [00:21:00] Jesus often did.

And Jesus asked a very clever question, a, a question that, that, that, that entrapped those who wanted to entrap him. He says, was John's baptism of heavenly or of human origin? That's an interesting question because, uh, they, they saw very clearly and the people overhearing this, the crowd, and this was now the Jerusalem, the Jerusalem crowd overhearing this, uh, knowing, uh, what Jesus had done.

And, and, and, and these representatives of the Sanhedrin, uh, were put into political peril here they're surrounded by masses. And Jesus had just asked him a question that was gonna trap them because, 'cause if they said, well, John's baptizing the people out at the river, Jordan was sent by God, John the Baptizer was doing God's work.

Uh, then they'll, then Jesus will say, why didn't you believe him? If, if it was God's work, why didn't you believe them? And why didn't you respond? Why didn't you change your waves? And then, then [00:22:00] they're, they're trapped, but they, they can't say it's of earthly origin because these people surrounding us were the ones who went out there.

They're the ones who believed him. They were afraid of the crowd. And Mark's gonna tell us this three times in this series, that they were afraid of the crowd. The crowd was what was protecting Jesus. So they, they, but, but Mark tells us they, they all thought John was a prophet. And so they equivocated that's what Mark, actually, his, the verb mark uses this.

They equivocated, they said, we don't know. In other words, they escaped and then Jesus then, uh, nails 'em. He said, okay, well neither will I tell you what kind of authority I have to do these things. So round one, I think we can score that one for Jesus. Then Jesus continues. He tells this parable, this very powerful parable, and it's one that would've been, uh, instantly recognized as, as he began the story because he begins it with, uh, almost a, a [00:23:00] verbatim quote of the Greek text of the prophet Isaiah.

He says, A man planted a vineyard. Put a fence around it. Dug a pit for the wine press and built the tower. If I were to put you side by side here, I'm putting side by side. The, uh, what Jesus is quoting. He is doing a riff on the song of the Vineyard, uh, which is, is again, it's first seven verses in the fifth chapter of I, the prophet Isaiah.

Uh, you see the same elements there in English. My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside, dug it, cleared wet stones, planted it with binds. Built a tower, dug out a wine vet in it. So Jesus is alluding to this very familiar prophecy from the prophet Isaiah, but there's two differences, a few differences here, uh, in, now let's, let's first of all, uh, orient ourselves the vineyard.

Symbolized Israel the vineyard very clearly, everyone would've understood the vineyard was Israel. They know that because even the temple, as you walked into the temple of the Gentiles, it was [00:24:00] covered with three foot sized gold grapes. A vine, a lattice vine made of gold symbolizing that, uh, the vineyard in Israel were the same.

Now in the Song of the Vineyard, accountability happens because the vineyard, which was Israel, had not produced the good fruit. It was supposed to, uh, produced it. Instead it produced wilder rotten fruit. But in Jesus's riff, uh, accountability happens for a different reason. It happens because. The tenants refused to give the owner it's due, his due, and they tried not only to, uh, to not pay the rent that they, that was his due, but they tried to steal the title to the vineyard itself.

They tried to say that the owner no longer owns the vineyard. Quite a, quite a claim. And so we see that the landlord in the parable sent many other servants, but thes tenants beat some and killed others. Now the word there, the servant, that's the word, do loss, uh, that gets translated sometimes into slave, [00:25:00] sometimes into the servant.

The do loss of the vineyards owned this reference to has a very clear reference and. Christian tradition recognizes this, that, uh, Jesus is referring to the prophets or where he says, what many prophets were rejected and Ill-treated, some were killed. Well, let's just name 'em, uh, that we know. Isaiah was killed.

Jeremiah was killed. Uriah who was like Jeremiah was killed. Ezekiel was killed. Michael was killed. Amazon. Amos. Amos was killed, Zechariah was killed. And most recently. The one that Jesus had just tied to himself and identified himself with, and Mark has done multiple times. John the Baptizer had been killed.

So the landowner now had a son, Jesus continues whom he loved dearly, and he sent that one and said, don't respect him. But that's not what happened. They said, this is the heir. Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours, the vineyard. That was owned by the, the landowner will no longer be the landowners.

The vineyard will be ours. And so they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out [00:26:00] of the vineyard. And then Jesus says, so what's the owner gonna do? Well, he'll come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others. Haven't you read this scripture, the stone, and he quotes here identically, the Greek in, uh, Psalm one 18, the one that when we, people were saying Hosanna, uh, you know, blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.

Last week, that was the quoting Psalm one 18. He quotes it again this time perfectly from the Greek. Uh. Haven't you read the scripture? The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it's amazing in our eyes. Now, why did Jesus do that? Well, by quoting Psalm one 18, he's doing, uh, something pretty important to, uh, the power of his rebuttal.

Um, you see the parable, uh, talks about God, uh, the, the, the landowner coming back and, uh, and. Uh, and dealing with the, the wicked tenants, but [00:27:00] it doesn't have any concept of that rejected son being vindicated nor, uh, taking, uh, the, the, the place of the owner. But Psalm one 18 does Psalm 18, uh, celebrates Israel's faithful Israels uh, divine.

Deliverance. In other words, a store, the Psalm is a responsive joy. It's a celebration that God has delivered and there's been a great reversal of fortunes. And now once again, the king has come to worship in, in his, in God's temple. And, and that's what he's quoting. And, and so there's this amazement that it expresses that.

At this unexpected, this unmerited grace from God. And, and it also has this thing that really could serve as, as the motto of Mark's gospel, the rejected stone becomes the most important. The first became last and the last became first the stone. The cornerstone of that temple. Well, 'cause of this, they wanted to arrest Jesus.

Mark tells us, uh, [00:28:00] because they knew that the parable. He told was against them. So he, this was not very subtle folks, uh, but once again, they were afraid of the crowd. So they left him in winne way, but they weren't done with them because they sent someone else. And now we have a, uh, we, we see here, we have a mark is, is introduced all the characters.

And now, and Jerusalem, he's bringing 'em all on stage at once. So. Before it was the representatives of the powers to be the Sanhedrin, which would've been the Sadducees party. Now we get two other elements we've seen up in Galilee that are there, the Pharisees, who were the opposition party, you know, and, uh, and the Herodians it, it, it says Herodians, you know, were the ones, uh, were, were the ones who, uh, ruled Galilee.

Uh, the Pharisees. Were the ones who were the scribal influences governing worship in Galilee. These were strange bedfellows. This was, this would be like Republicans and Democrats, uh, [00:29:00] uh, cooperating to respond to this threat of the status quo that Jesus represented. So this time it's this other group, uh, the opposition party comes to Jesus and they come to him and they say.

Uh, they do what the, the rich young man did when he, he, he flattered Jesus first. They flatter him. They say, teach you. We know that you're genuine and don't worry about what people think. You don't show favoritism, but teach God's way as it really is. And then they ask this question, which the gospel tells us was intended to, and the word it uses is to ensnare Jesus.

They ask, does the law permit people to pay taxes to Caesar? Or not the tax question, should we pay taxes or not? If Jesus answers one way or the other, he'll trap himself. That was the idea. You see, the, the, the taxes had to be paid. I. Uh, by the silver Denarius of Rome, the not the Ari, uh, [00:30:00] had on them. If you had, you, we have several of them still here, so we know what they look like.

And they had Tiberius image on 'em. So it had a graven image, which was blasphemous Jews on it. And on it, on one side of it, on underneath his image it said, uh, sun of the Divine Augustus. And so it declared that the Caesar was divine, the son of God. And. On the other side, it said it named him as Pon, uh, Pontifex Maximus.

In other words, the high priest of all. And uh, and that was the coin. That's what the coin said. And so the common understanding was that these coins belonged to Rome, belonged to the emperor, and they were politically offensive. They were, they were the sign of the tribute, uh, that should be paid. And it was only had to be paid by those who were occupied by Rome.

And it was, as I said, religiously offensive. And it was politically offensive because, uh, it signified, um, uh, the subjugation of Rome. And so Jews or ordinarily avoided denari entirely. They, they [00:31:00] only, uh, uh, did their commerce with, with copper coins, so they wouldn't have to do with this. And as I said, a reminder that the revolt that Mark is addressing that is about to bring about the, the destruction of Jerusalem was about.

The tax, the refusal to pay these taxes. And so, uh, as I said, there was a spectrum here. Just as we have a spectrum before us, as we look at what we're gonna do politically in our country. Well, the Herodians supported it 'cause they were, they were in favor, they were benefiting by the current regime. They were the ultimate collaborationists the.

Pharisees were divided across the spectrum, sort of like our progressives and, and moderates in the Democratic party. You know, the, the peaceful part of the Pharisees, uh, resented it and tried to politically resist it, but they complied because they were governed by a commitment to nonviolence. And, and the militant pharisees from which Paul of Tarsis, uh, would arise, uh, refused to pay the tax.

They, they, they, uh, they behaved in and, and argued for a, a militant response [00:32:00] to it. And the most radical. Of all the Pharisees note that would come to know as the zealots later, uh, uh, un na said it was unlawful to even touch one of these, and so if Jesus said, yes, it's lawful to pay taxes permitted. Then he would be seen as a traitor in the eyes of the Kos, the crowd, the people of the land that were gathered.

You know, he'd be betraying his own supporters, but if he said no, well then they would be able to charge him with treason or sedition, and then do exactly what they're ultimately going to do, turn him over to Rome for execution as a political revolutionary. So Jesus knew what was happening and he said to him, why are you testing me?

And they did something really clever. He says, huh, bring me a coin. Show it to me. And they brought one, you gotta ask, how do they bring one unless they were carrying it, right? So, uh, and then he said to them, whose image and inscription is this? And they rightly said, [00:33:00] Caesars and Jesus' response. Hmm. Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God, what belongs to God.

This is such a clever counter question on Jesus's response. First of all, it, it revealed the hypocrisy of the, of his questioners. The Herodians and the Pharisees were carrying the very. Coin, uh, that, that, that, so it, it showed that they were among the groups that were opposed to the people of the land who opposed the curing of those coins.

It revealed them, named them as collaborationists with the regime. Now, another point I just mentioned saying Jesus touched the coin, which indicated that he was not among the group, uh, that were on the radical right, if you will, uh, of, of the party at the time. Uh, but, but, but he very cleverly, uh, refused to answer the question in ways that would allow them to indict him.

Uh, he avoided actually naming what was owed to Caesar [00:34:00] and what was owed to God. However, he did it in such a way that though people of his time. Would have understood very clearly where he stood because he quoted the, the, the, his response back to them actually quoted the, the text that we read in our Old Testament lesson today from one Maccabees, the, the deathbed utterance of Matthias Maccabia.

Uh, where, where, you know, give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God. What belongs to God, uh, is, is, uh, is in the Greek a much more clear rendering of what Matthias said. Pay back the Gentiles in full seizure, of course, being the ultimate Gentile and obey the commands of the law. So, um, if you look at the context of that, you know, the, you know, Matthias was saying rally around all who would observe the law and avenge the wrong done to your people, pay back the Gentiles in full, give the Gentiles.

What does there do, in other words. So Jesus says, give to God what belongs to God. And, and so if you [00:35:00] were among the people of the land, you would've heard, been able to hear Jesus repudiating. Caesar's claims to divinity repudiating Caesar's claims to. Be the supreme earthly leader. Uh, you wouldn't hear him making any distinction between the God and, and the state God and the temple state, but rather, uh, uh, affirming that the, the biblical truth that the psalms all talked about, that the earth is the Lord's and all that is in it.

And, uh, uh, and, and no Jew. Would've thought that there was a proper analogy between the debt that Israel owed to Yahweh and any other claim. So if you talk about giving to God what belongs to God, uh, there is no comparison to what, what is owed to God. So everything o owes to everything is owed to, uh, God, and, and therefore what is owed to Caesar?

Well, not [00:36:00] much. And so Jesus is effectively saying, Hey. Give him his worthless piece of silver. That's all it is, but render to God all things. Do all things that tore instructs. In other words, since God alone is divine and all belong to God, and, and, and Mark tells us that his reply left them speechless. So what does this say about the parable?

Well, I think it says just what we saw last week, that judgment is salvation. And what I mean by that is if you go back and look at the parable, let's saying the. Tenets fail to give God, God's do. And who are the tenets? Well, we've already seen the tenets are, uh, the people who run the temple state, the ones in power, the elite who have the ability to, to, to make the vineyard a fruitful place.

They have failed to do that. They're. And they failed to do it because they failed to give God what is God's do. And in fact, they're doing more than that. They're seeking to enforce squatter's rights on the vineyard, uh, [00:37:00] denying that the vineyard people of Israel actually belong to God and leading them away from that.

And, and, and he, Jesus very candidly says, Hey, you're gonna kill God's son. He, he names what they're, he knows that they're about to do, but that's okay because God will vindicate his son right back at you. And then he says something really significant here. He's saying in the parable that the tenets will be replaced.

You, my political opposition here, you who are raided before me, you who have been given the, the power to make things right. Haven't done it. You haven't given God God's due. You've tried to seize that, which is God's for yourself. Well, you will be replaced by something, uh, that will do give God God's news.

So what's the good news in this today? Well, I think, uh, as I read this today, I hear, uh, something that is a real warning to me. You know, I'm, I'm white, I'm wealthy, I am right-handed, and I'm male. So I am in the [00:38:00] majority of every single, you know, everywhere I go, I'm in the majority, pretty much. Uh, or in the position of power, I have the ability, I am like here in the United States, what the, um.

People who were, the tenants were alike. I have the ability, I'm among the group whether I actually, uh, even in my individual, uh, role have much power. That's a different question, but I'm col as part of a, of a group that that is a collective I have. Inherited. I am the incumbent, uh, that has the ability to make the vineyard the fruitful place that God has.

And if I'm, and, and so, so I'm, I hear in this a word of accountability, a warning about God's accountability. Uh, as I think about the way things are going in our country, it doesn't matter which political part I I'm in, whether it's the Pharisees and the Odians on one side, or the, or the scribes of the chief priests on the other who were political opponents.

All of those groups who had power were being called to account by Jesus [00:39:00] in this parable. And uh, and so for me, this is a real word of, of warning, and I think it's a word of good news to, uh, to all, um, uh, others. Now, uh, I, I would, I would say to to, to you that, uh, this is not. Demonizing all who are in that category.

Not all white, wealthy, right-handed males, or white wealthy, right-handed females, or even left-handed females who are white are, are being demonized, which is what, uh, the wokeness in our society tends to do. But rather, uh, we are being named as the, as the ones who are on watch, it's our watch. And therefore we will be held accountable, uh, for the fruit that we bear on our watch.

And I think this is a word of hope. A word of hope for all who yearn for deliverance from all the structures we've been talking about in our society, uh, that, that, that trap people in despair, that, that trap people in, in, in structures and systems that dehumanize them. Uh, and I, and, and this is [00:40:00] a word of hope because God says very clearly, uh, that this is the day of the Lord.

It's happening, folks. It's here. And, and God will, God's word will not return empty. The stone rejected by the builders is now the main foundation stone. This has happened. Why? Because of the Lord. And its amazing grace. This is the day the Lord acted and, and this, this word of good news. We will rejoice in celebrating it.

We're watching, uh, God, God, uh, God's march. We're, we're seeing the, the grapes of wrath being trampled. That's what's happening in our time right now. I think this is the good news and, uh, may we all, uh, hear it and be moved. To the right places because of it. In name of the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.
