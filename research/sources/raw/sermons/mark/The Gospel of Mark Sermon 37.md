# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 37

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we continue in our celebration of, uh, of, uh, the Thanksgiving week. Uh, here in the United States and we continue in our study of the Gospel of Mark and we begin a new church year. Uh, we begin the season of Advent, so a lot going on today. Today, I wanna remind you that we've been working through the gospel of Mark all gear long, and we have been trying to understand this.

Portrait of Jesus that Mark has put together in the, in the context of Great Cha, among the communities that he, uh, founded, um, who were, uh, experiencing the trauma of, of, uh, expectation of the Roman legions descending upon Jerusalem. About to destroy the temple. And so he's retelling this story in his gospel and thereby presenting a portrait of Jesus helps us to understand who Jesus was for Mark and therefore who Jesus is [00:01:00] for us and, and how we are to live with Jesus in our time.

And so we've been trying to understand Mark from the perspective of, uh, the artist that he was, in other words, doing a literary reading. So. We're gonna continue on that. So today I'd like to just jump right into the text and, um, and, uh, take the plot so that we pay some close attention to the text and, and, and, uh, notice things that, uh, I, at least for me, when I read this text that's so familiar to me, I, I often, uh, read, read right over some details that I think when we take a literary reading of Mark, we say, uh, we see.

Uh, we're actually meant to cause us to pause and, and provide really essential information so we can understand the drama that he's presenting to us today. So, without further ado, let's first of all talk about the setting of, uh, the gospel of, of Mark. Uh, right off the bat, uh, mark tells us, uh, gives us an I importing, uh, an important [00:02:00] datum.

Uh, and, and that is, uh, when was this all of this happening? Uh, he takes careful note of the date. He says, it was two days before Passover and the festival unleavened bread. Now for the Jews, the, you know, often they would say, Passover, and today in our society we will refer to Passover and we'll understand it as an octave.

In other words, uh, from a Jewish, uh, calendar perspective, eight days, an octave of days, uh, that begin, uh, and end, and we, we, we collectively called it the Passover. But in, in, uh, from, from a technical perspective, technical sense, uh, in a historic sense. Uh, it's actually two festivals. Two feast for one is the celebration of the Passover prescribed, uh, by God in the Book of Exodus as part of the mosaic law.

And then another festival, the festival unle of unleavened bread that would then continued. And this being, uh, uh, a religious. Celebration that has been layered [00:03:00] on top of, uh, of a harvest festival. That would've happened at the time in this first spring harvest. And so Mark tells us it was two days before Passover and the festival unleavened bread of unleavened bread.

So why does that matter to us? Why is that so important? And I'll, I'll allude to this a couple of times today 'cause I, I wanted you to, to get this in your head because sometimes in our liturgical celebrations, we muddle. What he's telling us. And so I wanna be clear that we notice what Mark is saying.

Mark and John in his gospel also tell us that this, uh, what we're the, the details we're about to see today, uh, began on the evening, which began on the Jewish state called Nissan 14, Nissan being the lunar month, uh, called Nissan and the 14th day of that month. And so what Jesus, what, what Mark's telling us is that Jesus.

Held his Passover meal, not on the official day, right? It says it was two days before Passover, but deliberately one day [00:04:00] early. Now, why might that be? Why would it way Jesus of how his held his Passover meal? One day early. We'll get back to that. I'll explain it, uh, a bit more on that, uh, later, but I wanted to just make sure we don't read over that.

The next thing in the setting is where were they? Well, the important thing I think we should see is that they are not in Jerusalem. What we've seen is, you've been following us over the course of the, of the, of these sermons is, is, uh, is that, uh, Jesus has been engaging, uh, the powers in Jerusalem. Then, uh, retreating to, uh, a, a safe house, if you will, in Bethany, there is a certain fugitive like quality that Mark is, is describing in the Gospel of John.

It's quite explicit and, and Mark, it's less clear that they are hiding. Uh, but one of the things we'll see shortly is that, uh. Uh, they were difficult to find. Now, one of the things you could keep in mind here is that, uh, uh, Jerusalem at the time we think [00:05:00] had maybe 10 to 18,000 people on a, a normal day, but it would swell to hundreds of thousand.

You know, the low end range is it would swell 10 times and have 180,000 people there. During the, um, the, the festival unleavened bread during the Passover celebration, these pilgrims would descending they, and, and they would, uh, they, they would, uh, spend, spend their time near the temple and that's where they would take their sacrificial lambs to be slaughtered for the Passover.

Uh, some estimates take it, there was as many as a million people. The important point is there was a very, there were very large. Crowds and Jesus, uh, and his disciples were able to hide out, uh, among those crowds pretty well. But at night, they would leave Jerusalem and they'd hang out in this, this, uh, safe house with this guy named Simon, who, uh, who's often called Simon, the leper, uh, Simon, who, uh, provided, uh, uh.

Nurture care for Jesus and them after they had done their engagement. [00:06:00] So we have a couple things. We really have three parts in our story today. The first one is what I wanna suggest to you, mark, is structured together to to provide once again a contrast between those who get Jesus and the disciples who were supposed to get.

Jesus, the ones who were, uh, who had seen everything on their journeys. If, if anything should have understood him and those who. Uh, who, who understood him intuitively. Uh, and, and also we see, uh, a, a, a contrast, uh, between the right response to the moment and a wrong response to the moment. So, so in that sense, I wanna talk about the paradigmatic disciple and the 12.

Briefly. So one of the things we, the, the, the, the way Mark sets this up is tell, reminding us of this fugitive quality of, of the, of the band of disciples, how many ev, whatever number there were that they gathered that night. Um, the, the, he tells us that the chief priest and the, and the pharisee, excuse [00:07:00] me, the chief priest and the legal, the scribes, the legal experts, uh, were searching for Jesus.

They wanted to arrest him and kill him. Now, because of all that. We've, we've, we've discussed before in our previous weeks. And so they were, as he said, mark says, using cunning tricks, uh, to figure out how to arrest him. But they, they were afraid to do that during the festival. Why? The crowds would turn on them.

They would be unable to control the crowds. They'd seen this before in, in Jewish history, and they did. They wanted to avoid that. Uh, there would be an uproar among the people. Mark tells us. And so they were trying to figure out how they could find Jesus in a way that would not be noticed. By the people.

That was important, right? Um, and, uh, and so, so Mark then gives us that little data point and then quickly shifts to a dinner. Now, this dinner, based on what he said, if it's two days before Passover would've been what you and I call Wednesday night. Uh uh, and, and so they are gathering, uh, that night, [00:08:00] uh.

And Jesus tells us that during that dinner, a woman, a woman who is not named in Mark's gospel, a woman comes in with a vase, an alabaster vase, and it had Spikenard in it. Spikenard is, is a very expensive, uh, ointment or perfume. And uh, what's interesting I find in Mark's gospel is the verb that he uses there.

It says she broke open the vase. Now I wanna think. You to think about, imagine a vase in your home, a vase. Now the word vase is, is a little bit different than, you know, a vial, right? This, the word there is not a vial. She, no, no. Mark tells us that she had a vase full of perfumes. So that tells us an awful lot who, who weren't in that culture.

We pause just to, to, to, to listen to what Mark is telling us. She has a vase and a vase full of very expensive. Perfume. Now, I know some of you guys have, have had, you know, very expensive containers of [00:09:00] very expensive scotch 'cause you've told me about it. Okay? Imagine that. All right. He, Marcus tells that she, she had filled up a very large container.

With an incredibly expensive perfume, and she takes it and, and, and, and she doesn't do like you. You know, some of you might imagine it says she broke open the vase, right? It, it's not like she took a bit of it, like when I baptized the baby and sort of sprinkled the water over Jesus. No, it says, mark tells us that she broke the vase and she poured this vase, all of its perfume, a massive amount.

I would think. On the, on his head. Now, the two of the gospels tell us that, you know, she have a similar story in which, which Jesus' feet are anointed. Uh, here in Mark and Nelson the gospel, John, uh, we see that Jesus' head is being anointed. And, and, and I want you to think she, she's given him a shower in perfume here, folks.

Uh, and, and as a result of that, seeing this display, you know, I, I, um, I'm, I'm I sometimes [00:10:00] imagine. Uh, when, you know, the, the response of the disciples, uh, as is, is, uh, the way that some of us respond when we see, uh, dis, you know, public displays of affection. You know, we go, oh, we turn our heads. We say, that's inappropriate to do.

Uh, and, and we're irritated by it. And, and Mark tells us that, uh. The disciples grew angry, and, and, and some of them, you know, were explicit. They, they, they, they said they were angry because she had wasted this perfume, this woman, this unnamed woman who had come prepared to this gathering on Wednesday night with this very expensive vial, a rather vase of perfume.

They were saying, you know, this was her, something she had purchased. This is something that she had, and they're complaining because the way that she chose to use it was not the way they felt she had chosen to use it. Why waste that perfume? It could have been sold for almost a year's pay and the money given to the poor.

Now, that's not really completely off [00:11:00] base because, uh, several chapters before, uh, we have seen Jesus repeatedly emphasizing the importance of caring for the poor. And so they're probably thinking that they're following Jesus here. Uh, and so they scolded her. Now, when I see Jesus's reaction, uh, I'm, I'm reminded of, uh, of, of my own, um, uh, f you know, uh, foibles.

Uh, sometimes I just am not. Self-aware. Sometimes I'm not aware of the moment. Uh, and so I behave in ways that in certain times would be right, but in that particular moment is wrong. And that's what Jesus says happens here. He says, you always have the poor with you and whenever you want, you can do something good for them, but you won't always have me.

She, this unnamed woman has done what she could. She has anointed my body. Ahead of time for burial. [00:12:00] Now, when I think about this, uh, you know, uh, this awareness I think of, of Martha and Mary, the story of Martha and Mary, where, where Jesus also reminds, uh, you know, Martha of, of Mary gets it. She is sitting at my feet.

I, you know, when Jesus talks about the bridegroom, you don't do these, these certain things when the bridegroom is with you. No, no, no. I'm reminded of hiking with my wife. Um, up on the Adirondacks and you know, I, and, and I'm familiar, uh, from past history of hiking with folks to who we work our tail off and we hike and hike and hike to get to the summit.

And then you get to this glorious summit and I've seen folks sort look at it and say. That was, that's pretty awesome. Take the picture, get a selfie, and then they go. They don't absorb the beauty, they don't absorb the moment. And I love the, the fact that my wife has taught me, you know, to pause and to soak.

In that moment, she, you know, she will inevitably [00:13:00] lead us to prayer and lead us to worship. In that moment. It will stay a long time up on those summits just. Absorbing this and hearing the symphony of God. You know, she has a, a, just a, a natural sense of doing the right thing at the right moment. And I think this is what Jesus is teaching the disciples here, she, this woman gets it.

Now, I imagine a lot of you women are rolling your eyes saying, yeah, they must have been men. You know, uh, they just didn't have a sense of the moment. And so Jesus says that this woman will be remembered from eternity. Throughout eternity because she was in the right posture of the, of discipleship. He says, I tell you the, I tell you the truth, wherever in the whole world the the gospel is announced.

What this woman has done, this unnamed woman has done will also be told in memory of her. Wow. Quite a contrast between this behavior of the woman who anointed Jesus, [00:14:00] uh, and, and, uh, and, and those who, uh. Responded with anger at, at, at that, at her, at her love, her affection, her adoration, and, and, and her sympathy for what Jesus was going through.

So Mark then continues in the, in the story, and he tells us, uh, and I won't spend too much time on this, about the betrayal. We're familiar with this. And what's what's interesting here, mark has very little to say about Judas. Other gospels tell us a lot about Judas. They were written much later. And imagine the.

The, the mythology about Jesus, about Judas had, had developed over time, over the centuries, over, excuse me, over the decades. Um, but it, tell Mark tells us simply that Judas Ariat, uh, went to the chief priest and gave them what they had been looking for. If you recall, he just told us, mark just told us a few minutes ago that, uh, that they were searching for a way to isolate Jesus, get him away from the crowds, find a way that they could arrest him and take care of him.

On a particular [00:15:00] timetable before the festival started. And, and, and Judas gives them exactly what they wanted. He, uh, he gives them, uh, the capability of making it an inside job. He's one of the 12, so he'll know where Jesus is. And he'll be able to inform them where they can find Jesus alone, uh, or, or not alone, but rather away from all the crowds who might protect him.

And so when they heard that Judas was willing to do this, they were delighted and promised to give him money and, uh, and therefore Judas. Mark tells us, started looking for an opportunity to turn him in. Yeah. Mark doesn't say an awful lot about Jesus. Doesn't, doesn't give him, devote a lot of words, uh, to, to this act.

It's as almost though, uh, he's not worthy of being memorialized much more, uh, than, than the words that are necessary to tell how Jesus died. So Mark pivots in the story and he tells now about, uh, something that would've happened, [00:16:00] uh, in, on that same day from a Jewish perspective. But on the next day, for you and I, in other words, this dinner would've happened, uh, on.

Uh, Wednesday night and, uh, uh, and, and for the Jew from Jewish perspective that that day would've continued all the way until the next sunset for you and I. The day would've broken and we would've seen the preparations that are about to be described happening on Thursday, what we call Thursday. And so.

Um, the, so he mark, he gives us another marker. He, mark tells us on the first day of the festival, unloved bread. The, in other words, he's very clear the day when the Passover lamb is to be sacrificed. But so the day that, that people go to the, go to, the priest at the temple offer their sacrifice. There, there the lamb that used to be sacrificed.

Now what is the, what does the priest do at the temple? They had this amazing plumbing system in the temple. And so the priest would take the lamb, [00:17:00] slit its throat, pour the blood into this drain pipe, and that drain pipe would, would, um, would take the blood over a set of fires where that bur blood would be burned and rise to the heavens like incense offering it to God.

Right? That's what they would do echoing. The story that we, we read earlier, uh, about, uh, about what was to happen, uh, in, in the covenant of, of, of Moses, uh, where, where Moses threw it upon the pillars, the blood upon the pillars. That's what the priest would basically do, something like that. So on that day when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, you know, it would've been that morning, the disciples said to Jesus, where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal now?

We ought glance over that question. First of all, it's very clear to us. I hope that Passover was a special meal. It was like our Thanksgiving feast. It, uh, it was something that you didn't do in an [00:18:00] ordinary way that would be unbecoming. Uh, and, and so the room, uh, that was provided when you had a group setting was.

More luxurious than a, than a normal, uh, home and more. And, and the setting was more formal than would've been normal for, uh, a family meal. And, and in such a setting, uh, it is appropriate for you to, to make it possible for your guest to recline for the meal as, as definitely Jesus was a, was reclining in the meal.

Uh, you know, on the, on the day, on the night before. And, and, and that was a, something that the wealthy were able to do, but the poor were not nor normally able to afford. Um, but it was an accepted convention during Passover, so there's some preparation for the Passover meal that was necessary logistically.

Not only that, they asked the question where, and that question was necessary. Where do we, you know, in Bethany? Can't be in Bethany because the Passover meal must be eaten within the city of Jerusalem by the pilgrims, so that their [00:19:00] normal hangout at Bethany, uh, wouldn't work. So pilgrims to the Passover, uh, festival normally would have, have to arrange, uh, you know, to use someone else's room for that occasion.

So you had a lot of people that were able to rent out their spaces. Um. Uh, and, and there was also ne it was also necessary for them to do some food prep. You know, I remember for this week, uh, you know, Sadine and I were hosting family and had a delightful time, but we had an awful lot of food prep that we did on the days before Tuesday and Wednesday.

Uh, for the, for the, for the Passover meal. It was necessary to do some very light prep, basically to, uh, to make the dough for some unleavened bread, which is basically water. And some, some wheat and to gather some bitter herbs and insufficient for the volume of people that they expected. Um, so let's go back to the dating of what this is.

So, so Mark's note, uh, that this prep happened on the festival. Unle Bread tells us that not only the meal, but also [00:20:00] the meal prep took place in the early hours after sunset on Nissan 14 the day. When the official sacrifice of Passover Lamb was to take place, this is important. Uh, so I wanted to get, get this to this chronology in your mind so that we can pick up on some of the symbolize symbolism that Mark is gonna be giving us here.

So after Sunset on that day, which would be for us. Thursday night, uh, the disciples ask, uh, about and begin to make preparations during the night. That meal, that last supper meal, that was for them the Passover meal, but for, for nobody else was a Passover meal. Uh, 'cause it would've been the next night. Uh, they held it that night and then Gethsemane happens and Jesus' rest.

And preliminary hearing happens. And then at sunrise still, you know, from Jewish perspective on that same day. Jesus was transferred into the custody of Pilate and we had the formal trial and conviction, and that [00:21:00] late morning and noon, uh, there was the crucifixion. Of course, Jesus, uh, traditions tell us, you know, died at 3:00 PM which is why we normally hold our Good Friday services at 3:00 PM.

So what's significant about that is it, you know, the official time for the sacrifice, sacrifice of lambs by everybody else was twilight. In other words, that 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM time before sunset is when you would bring your lamb, uh, to the temple and you'd walk at home and prepare it that night. Uh, so the Passover land will be slaughtered at twilight.

On the Jewish day of Nissan 14th, which would be Friday at 3:00 PM and it would be eaten, uh, at, on the next Jewish day, which began just an hour or two later at sunset, uh, which would be for us that Friday night. So Jesus, in other words, is doing his last supper one day before the Passover, and he himself will be executed at the same time [00:22:00] that the rest of the world is slaughtering their Passover lands.

I hope you see where that mark is headed with this symbolism or making this connection for us through the time. So I wanna remind you about the, uh. The, the requirements for that Passover, it comes from Exodus 12. Uh, where, where the, for the Passover. Jesus, uh, you know, I mean, brother Moses uh, reminds, uh, the people that at Twilight, uh, the whole assembly, uh.

We'll, slaughter their lambs, that's the law. They then take that blood and smear it on their doorposts and on the beam over the doors of their houses in which they're eating. And that same night, you have to eat the meat, uh, that you've roasted and it, you'll also eat with it the unleavened bread and bitter, bitter herbs signifying, uh, the exodus.

Through which God had guided them, the first exodus. Um, so Jesus answered the disciples. When they asked, what should we do? He [00:23:00] said, he said something really intriguing. He said, he said two of his disciples and said to them, go into the city. A man carrying a white, a water jar will meet you. Follow him. I hope you don't just pass over this.

This is, this is almost like a, a slapstick, uh, uh, you know, uh, rather like a parody of, of some, you know, detective movie, um, you know, the, they, somebody's already been set up who would be easily identified, right? And you'll recognize him by, you know, the red carnation in his, in his, in his lapel or something like that.

That in this case, uh, you'll see a man carrying a water jar. A water jar. That's how you will recognize him and follow that man. So think about 180,000 people, everyone, you know, melling about in Jerusalem, and you're gonna find this needle in a haystack because he's carrying a water jar. How could that be?

Well, it turns out that historically it would not have been so far [00:24:00] fetched because the man actually would've been easily identified with a water jar because men didn't carry water, carry water jars that often. Women carried water jars to supply domestic needs to their families, and the water was only really carried by women.

Men, if they ever carried water, never carried it on their heads the way women did. They would always use a skin rather than a jar. It would be a rare event. And so this little, little sign, uh, helps us understand that a little bit. And so he said, when, when, when the man enters, tell the owner, uh, you know, the teacher asks, the rabbi asks, Jesus asks, where is my guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?

And he'll shard show you a large room, that famous upper room, and that's where you should prepare, uh, for, uh, that meal. And so Jesus, uh, mark tells us that the disciples left, uh, found everything just as he had told them. And so they went about doing what he said. They prepared for the Passover meal, which brings [00:25:00] us to Mark's account of the Last Supper.

And, uh, so now he tells us that evening, right. Uh, Jesus arrived with the 12 I as you as I just shared with you, the Passover meal had to be eaten at night because it's, it's, it's a memorial of that first Passover from Exodus 12 when, if you remember, uh, the Passover blood being over the, over the signpost signifying that you were of the tribe of Israel.

And, uh, the tribe of the Hebrews that is. And, uh, and the destroyer who would come to destroy, uh, all of those who were pharaoh's minions, uh, in the first barns, uh, you know, the, the, the destroyer would pass over your home if it was marked by the blood, and that happened at night. So, uh, the, the two disciples prepared the meal after sunset on the evening, [00:26:00] OFAN 14th, and Jesus and the other 10, uh, joined them perhaps about two hours or more after sunset.

Um, so the meal would've happened sometime between sunset and midnight. Uh, and uh, and that then helps us understand how all the other. Uh, details that Mark's gonna narrate, such as the approach to Pilate in the early morning, et cetera, could happen. It had to be done by midnight. Midnight, uh, by, by tradition.

Uh, so I wanna remind you what, uh, of the words that Tom read us as we get into Jesus's words. The, the Tom read us from, uh, Exodus, uh. Chapter 24 verse eight, where, where we see the Mosaic covenant. Uh, and, and if you recall, Moses had just come down and received the law. He, in the 70, ascended the mountain.

And only then Moses went before Jesus and he received the, the 10 commandments and he brought them back down, uh, to the people. [00:27:00] That he created, uh, as God had instructed this covenant with God, uh, that was, that was sanctified by, uh, Moses's action in verse eight. He took the blood from the sacrifice that he had dashed against the pillars signifying the tribes of Israel, and he threw that blood, you know, half of it.

He, he, he. Offered up to God. The other half he threw, uh, over the people this, and he said these words, this is the blood of the covenant. This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord now makes with you on the basis of all these words, in other words, on the basis of the 10 Commandments. And, and, and what's interesting to note is, is that this is a, a covenant made with a particular people who had familial lines.

They, they were sealed by the blood, but the membership in that covenant was based on their own blood. That's important background to what Jesus is about to do, and I wanna [00:28:00] remind you of the words that Mary Jo read to us. Where, where the, where the prophet Jeremiah says, Hey, the people of Israel broke the covenant.

Broke the covenant that Moses, uh, invoked in this, throwing the blood over the people. They broke that covenant. And, uh, so, so I will make a new. Covenant. So the prophecy from Jeremiah's, that is that I will make a new covenant, the people of Israel, and uh, and I will write their instructions on their hearts.

Uh, and so, so what we see Jeremiah prophesying and speaking about is before the way you were participant in the, in the, the covenant was you were of the family that had been marked by the blood of this sacrificial bull. Uh, and, and, and the, and your membership in that was marked also by circumcision of the foreskin of the males.

Right. And prophecy of Jeremiah is saying, I will create a new covenant [00:29:00] and I will circumcise their hearts. I. That's the prophecy, all of which is in the background that Mark's listeners and certainly Jesus's disciples would've been familiar with and heard as Jesus gathered them for this Passover celebration that he held the day before.

The Passover, the officially appointed time for the Passover. And so we then read these words that I know are oh, so familiar to all of us. 'cause we saved them during the Eucharist. These are the words of institution we call them in the Eucharist. While they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples.

Right? See, I'm, I'm doing it automatically from the Eucharist, gave it to them and said, take, this is my body. Now what I wanted to have you notice is that, uh, Jesus's words here, not what we, what would happen to appear in the Book of Common Prayer. Uh, not quite. Mark's [00:30:00] emphasis is not on some memorial to this in remembrance of me that's not in the gospel, uh, but rather, uh, it's on his body and the symbolic nature of Jesus' death.

Uh, those are the ones that would've. Uh, most immediately affected the disciples at the time, and, and, and, and the immediate relevance to them in the original Passover context, wa was, uh, was, was the, was the context of the unleavened bread. The, the bread that Jesus is holding is the unleavened bread of the Passover meal.

Jesus was the host. The host, he naturally took it, broke it just as the father always took and broke the unleavened bread at any family PEs over meal. Now, the blessing that every other father would've said would've been the regular grace. Blessed are you, Lord, our God king of the world who brings forth bread from the earth.[00:31:00] 

That's the normal blessing from the Passover. And we see that in the MNA in Jesus' time, the, and around that time, that would've been the words that would've been the regular grace. Um, but in this case, you know, uh, Jesus, uh, uh doesn't do what's normal, what's normally hap what normal happens was is that the unleavened bread, the Passover lamb, the bitter herbs.

Were spoken of in the Passover ceremony with interpretive words, which must be spoken. Yeah. The specific words about, you know, about the unleavened bread refer to, uh, we're eating this because our fathers were redeemed from Egypt, and, and there's a reference to their time in the wilderness where they, where they had to, to eat, you know, unleavened bread.

Um, but that's not. Those are not the interpretive words that Jesus says as Mark tells us they eat. Now he's invoking the Passover. He's, he's creating the situation, but now he's giving a new interpretive spin on what the unleavened bread means. Um, he interprets the [00:32:00] bread as his own body, referring clearly to his death, the broken bread being shared and eaten.

Means to disciples hearing that, that just as they would've been prepared, they, they participate in the Passover of the Fathers, uh, you know, from generations past. Now they participate in Jesus' death as they consume of that bread. So given the Passover context with all that redemptive symbolism of the unleavened bread, what Jesus said connected his death with there and our.

Deliverance. And then Mark tells us that Jesus took a cup and he gave thanks. He gave to them and they all drank from it. Um, he said to them, this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Now, as I said to you, uh, this, this pouring out of the blood has had significance to them that they [00:33:00] would've recognized immediately, according to the me of the, the, the, at least four cups of wine were drunk at the Passover meal, and when the second cup was drunk, the full account of the Passover event from Exodus was resided.

Always an answer to a child's question. You've probably seen that before at a Seder, Jesus interprets. Uh, the cup of wine instead with an allusion to Exodus 24 8, the one that, uh, we just read where Moses shared the laws of the people, uh, laws with the people, and where Moses sealed the covet of God with Israel by scattering the blood of the sacrifice Bull.

Over the people. And as that original covenant was sealed with a blood sacrifice and, and the blood was shared among the people of that covenant, Jesus is saying to us, so too, a new covenant is being inaugurated with a new sacrifice in the blood shared among the people. [00:34:00] Of the new covenant symbolized not by having wa blood poured over us, but by our drinking from the cup of wine.

And that brings to mind, of course, I hope for you, as it would've for the disciples of Mark, I mean the, the, the, uh, Jesus' disciples, as Mark tells it, um, the promise of that new covenant from Jeremiah 31 31. Uh, the promise of a new covenant and of our circumcised hearts, and it seems likely that's how the disciples would've understood it.

The bottom line is this, as God first rescued God's people from Egypt and made God's covenant with them at Sinai, so to there is now a new beginning for the people of God and it finds its focus. No longer in the temple, which Jesus has said is going to be destroyed, but in and no longer in some ritual of animal sacrifice, but through the imminent death of [00:35:00] Jesus, which turns out is going to happen about 3:00 PM at the time for the slaughter of the Passover land.

All of this, of course, vividly recalls the prophecy of the suffering servant, which we've read before from Isaiah 53, which speaks of, again, the redemptive death of the suffering servant, so that all whom God loves might have life because the iniquity of this all is cast upon that servant suffering servant.

And then Jesus says, I share you. I won't drink wine until that day when I drink it in a new way. In God's kingdom, the, the kingship of God whose arrival Jesus has already announced proclaimed is not yet I. Fully there. It's not yet fully present. That's why we say it's here now, but not yet. It's, it's on the way.

It's being, it's being brought to its fulfillment and will not be complete until the fulfillment of time. And on that day, Jesus said, Jesus said [00:36:00] he will drink with us in a new way in the in God's kingdom. When Jesus drinks again, it will be in a situation where God's kingship is more fully realized than was yet in evident particular on that Passover meal before Jesus' death.

And then Markin, he tells us in response to this, after they sang a bunch of praise songs, I mention, imagine it was some contemporary Christian music with a lot of loud music, don't you? Um, they went out to the Mount of Olives. So in all of this, folks, I see lots of good news. Uh, I hope you do as well. The first thing is that when we share in the celestial banquet, in other words, when we commune together, we engage in our eucharistic sharing.

When we eat of the bread and drink of the cup, we participate in the body of the host. Jesus. And we are marked by his blood and, and as members of the new Covenant with God. And as such, we may say we are protected from the destroyer. [00:37:00] That's a very important point. We are protected. You are protected from the destroyer.

There's nothing, uh, that's gonna separate you from God's love, including Satan. Uh, will not, will not, uh, will not. Um, be able to isolate you from God's love, God's promises. I will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin. That's the, that's what happens in the new covenant. That's what God, that's the covenant God has made with you.

I will forgive your wrongdoing and never again. Remember your sin and through this promise. God frees us. God frees you to love all whom God loves and thereby become fully human. In other words, God frees you, liberates you from the bondage of sin. All the things that are in you that are confused, that are is life in the brambles that, that are preventing you from loving with all of you, with every five year of your [00:38:00] being all whom.

God loves. Uh, and so, uh, being free is this capacity to love. And that's what happens through this forgiveness of sin that is marked by, uh, the blood. And when we are fully human in this way, we experience the thing that we all hope for, the peace and joy that Paul talks about, which surpasses all understanding.

And folks, that's what God desires for you today. So I hope as we gather next for the Eucharist, you'll remember these things it'll, and, and, and be enriched by what the significance was, the deep meaning of this promise that God has made for you. In the name of the Father and Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. I.
