# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 25

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we're gonna talk once again about 11. Uh, but, uh, in past weeks we, we talked about the 11 of the Pharisees, and before that, 11 of Herod. Today we're gonna talk about the love of Jesus. I wanna remind you, we have been, um, going through, um, a. Read a close reading of the Gospel of Mark.

If you've joined us, you know, we've taken great care to step back and try to understand why Mark has included certain stories where he did and the way he did. Uh, what is it that he is, uh, saying to us about who this Jesus is and our relationship, uh, with, with Jesus? What is, what is it that we are to understand, uh, so that our eyes.

Um, might, uh, might see, uh, that which is happening about us in, in this, uh, world that God is creating. Um, and, uh, I I wanted [00:01:00] to remind you first of all of what has transpired because we come now this week to really the ending of the first half of the gospel of Mark Literarily, where you've been doing a literary reading of the Gospel of Mark, understanding it as art, uh, assigning to Mark.

Uh, the, the, uh, the, you know, the arts manship, uh, of, of someone who has great intention is trying to signify, uh, at, at many levels of richness, uh, that which he cannot say with mere words through. The stories that he's put together. Uh, and, and one of the things that he did literarily, if we look back at the entire gospel of Mark, is we can see that the first eight chapters constitute a story that takes place in Galilee, and it's the gathering of the disciples.

And, and, uh, and the second half of it, uh, Jesus moves, uh, from Gali to Jerusalem. His relationship with disciples themselves, uh, grow more [00:02:00] strained as they struggle with, uh, with this question that Jesus asks them at the end, do you not yet understand? Um, and so what have we seen so far? Well, then the big picture in the most recent, uh, weeks, what we've seen is, is uh, that mark for some reason had put together.

Two crossings, uh, stories of two crossings. He's used as like framing in his, in his art, uh, two crossings of the Sea of Galilee, uh, which is a lake of course, but, but, and we've talked about this boundary crossing that when they cross the, the, the Sea of Galilee, it's like crossing the wilderness. They're going into this new land, this land of the Gentiles.

And so we saw Jesus would perform certain. Uh, great acts and teachings among the Jews, and then he'd cross the Sea of Galilee and he, and, and, and having crossed that boundary, we'd see stories that, uh, were parallel stories. They were creatively a doublet of [00:03:00] stories, if you will, one in his home, in his home area with the Jews, another.

Uh, uh, in the home of the Gentiles. And then we saw similarly, uh, some, some, uh, wonderful wilderness feedings once again. One among, uh, his own people in Galilee, another across the sea. And so what we see here today, the story begins after having, uh, we're, we're, we're picking it up again. Having looked at those doublets and having remembered the, the leaven of King Herod and how he gave.

Uh, John the Baptist's head on a, uh, on a platter, uh, uh, and, uh, and having, having remembered the loving of the Pharisees, where, where, uh, they, uh, had a, had a, had a particular way in their holiness movement of calling Israel to be Israel, uh, and Jesus, we saw Jesus taking both of those on. Um, well, well, well, now, uh, we are, we're, we're done with that.

And we see sort of a, an epilogue, a mark coming [00:04:00] together and concluding the first chapter, uh, pulling all these threads, uh, together. Uh, we from, you know, moving forward, we won't see these locations. We won't see the Sea of Galilee. We won't see the emphasis on wilderness feedings. We. We won't see these contentions with the, uh, with, with Herod and Galilee until the very end of the story, uh, where Jesus is being brought to the cross.

Uh, so, uh, this is a very important pointing, turning point. And we see today Jesus sort of summarizing, uh, where things are. In his ministry. Um, and I, I want to, uh, bring up, uh, one, one, uh, geographic lesson for us because there's a reference that's gonna be made later in, in, uh, in our story. Uh, where, where, uh, where, where we hear Moses talking.

I'll bring back that. I just wanna bring, called this map and, and give you a shot of, of, of what we believe the map looked like in, uh, [00:05:00] uh, in not Jesus' time. In Moses' time, and I wanted to remind you of a story, uh, that, uh, that we see in the book of Deuteronomy. The book, book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy means the second, you know the word terro, uh, and then nomos.

Those two words mean the second law. In other words. Deuteronomy retells many of the stories that we see in the Book of Exodus, which was the giving of the law at Mount Sinai or Horeb, as it's often called Mount Horeb or Mount Sinai. Uh, and that's the giving of the Mosaic law. So that's the story of Exodus gives us that.

Um, uh, but, but in the terro, nomos in the second giving of the law, uh, we have a retelling of that story. But now the, the people, instead of being, uh, at Mount Sinai, they are all gathered together, uh, in the place that today, in our world, we would call, uh, Jordan, uh, along the. [00:06:00] Um, Jordan River, but the land of Jordan, uh, that we, the, the nation of Jordan is, uh, can, you know, is very similarly geographically disposed as the kingdom of Moab was.

If you look, look in the purple region there on the map, that's the kingdom of Moab and that's where all the Hebrew tribes have been gathered by Moses. And we have the second giving of the covenant with God there. Uh, and uh. And we'll come back to that because they're about to enter the promised land.

And once again, Moses reestablishes God's covenant with them and reminds them of all that God had done for them in their past. So I wanted to share that with you, but I also wanna remind you of the. Bad leavens that, that, uh, mark has, uh, put in contrast to this, this, this new social order that Jesus is proclaiming.

Um, the first one that, that we've seen in conflict in the, in the first eight chapters is, is the, the leaven of the Pharisees. Now, the Pharisees, as I said, were a holiness movement. These were [00:07:00] good people. These were the natural allies of Jesus. These are the ones from whom Jesus is. Group of Jews sprang. Uh, these are the ones who, the Pharisees who gave us Paul, uh, they were very intent on doing things right and being right with God, but they had a particular way of doing it, uh, that Jesus challenged in profound ways, and we have seen doing it.

Uh, and, and there. Their basic thesis is the way that we get God to, uh, deliver us. The way we persuade God to deliver us is being more intentionally God's people as given in the law. And that means, and this is where Jesus, uh, goes to battle with them. That means that the, that the, the way we are Israel is by observing very strict social boundaries and very strict, um.

Norms of racial purity. Uh, and the social boundaries, of course, involve table fellowship. So what really matters, who you eat with, uh, as we have seen. [00:08:00] And, uh, we'll come back to that. Uh, and then the, the leave of Herod. And in this case it's, uh, Herod the Great son, anti pa. Leaven of Herod, um, is, uh, is also calling the Jews to a, uh, to a form of integration.

Uh, but that integration is, hey, the way that we Israel are saved, uh, is, is by, uh, joining, uh, with, uh, the rest of the world by, uh, immersing ourselves in it and becoming like the culture, uh, in which we are embedded becoming more Greek. Uh, and, you know, which is, you know, the word has given us hellenized, you know, adopting the, the modern Greek ways.

And by collaborating with Rome, and of course by collaborating with Rome, that means embracing the mindset that understands that the way that we receive peace, the peace of our hearts. Is by honoring, uh, the, the power of Rome. In other words, it's a piece that comes through the fear [00:09:00] of what Rome can do for us.

And so we collaborate and we, we are, we, we, uh, subordinate ourselves to that, and then we can, uh, then we can survive. And, and what that. Works out with, uh, um, is for something very similar, uh, works out to be something, something that we see, uh, very much in our own country where we have a, a, a very similar, um, kind of of approach to the, to the, the love of her, which in which we say, uh, those of us who are.

The dominant culture, say, Hey everyone, we are a free country. Everyone is free, uh, to live and move and be as, as they desire, as long as, uh, they become more like us. The dominant culture, more white, more Anglo-Saxon, more Protestant. And that's sort of the, the theme that we've been tracing. I don't need to unpack that, but I'll use that as an analogy to the kind of thing that Jesus was taking on when he was taking on the leaven of Herod.

So we get this thing where we [00:10:00] first see the Pharisees coming to see Jesus, and they say, show us a sign. We'll trust your way. Okay. You're, you're, you're ma. You have this huge movement that's happening in our midst and we're gonna trust your way, but you need to show us a sign and we'll believe us, you know, show us a sign from heaven.

And I wanna remind you that whenever we say show us a sign like this, uh, that Mark actually here is doing something quite interesting. The word that he uses, they came to. Tests. Jesus. The only other place where Mark uses the language, uses the, the Greek, uh, and, and the verb, uh, that, that he uses here is, is when there's, uh, another player on stage, uh, testing Jesus.

And that was Satan. So in this case, mark has very artistically put the Pharisees in the role of the one who tested Jesus, Satan. They are acting, in other words, as Satan's. Agents inviting Jesus, uh, to be something that Jesus was not [00:11:00] called to be. Uh, you know, we'll, we'll trust you if you prove that you're God with us in the ways that we expect to encounter God in the ways that we stipulate.

Show us your power. Um, you know, the, the, uh, you know the evidence. Is sufficient. You know, uh, it'll be sufficient if you give us some miracles, uh, uh, and, uh, we demand miracles so that, uh, um, that you know that, that, that we'll know that you're the Messiah. And what they were looking for was a mystically magical messiah, wholly different from and presiding over us, rather than who Jesus is and was a humble.

In fleshed presence of God with us, in solidarity with us, not over us, but alongside us as we pursue our own lives of finite freedom. And so, uh, when we, when they demanded, uh, that, uh, uh, Jesus, [00:12:00] uh. You know, provide miracles. Uh, they were tempting him to be something he was not. I'll trust you if you prove your faithfulness, if, if you prove your worthiness, if you prove your love.

As I, as I think of this story, I'm reminded of some of my own sins. Uh, uh, one of the great blessings of my life is my sacramental marriage to Sina and. And, uh, you know, said, Jean, I come from different worlds much as much as, uh, you know, the, the, the Pharisees and, and, and Herodians were from different worlds, you know, starkly different cultures that are often incompatible.

I'm from Louisiana and she's from Tennessee. Very few couples are able to overcome that kind of, of difference. And, uh, oh yeah, there's a racial difference too. She comes from, uh, uh, an Indian heritage and I come from that white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Heritage that's embedded in the south so [00:13:00] powerfully.

And what I find often for, you know, in myself is as, as we have struggled to, uh, deal with our differences, uh, from these different cultures, is that sometimes I will feel, hmm. Alone. Sometimes I will feel, uh, I'll have the sense that, uh, that, uh, we are not together as we should be. That the, the solidarity that I'm desiring is not there.

And I'll, and I'll test her. I'll test her, I'll, I'll, uh, say, well, if you loved me, then you would do the, you would do this. Uh, prove your worth, prove your faithfulness to me. Prove your love to me. A lot of us do that, whether we're talking about doing it with our spouses or we're talking about doing it with our own children and, uh, or our own parents.

Uh, uh, you know, to do this, to show me, to, to prove to me that you remind me, show me a sign. Show me a sign of your faithfulness. Show me a sign [00:14:00] of your love for me. I find that I like the Pharisees do that quite a lot and I think I sometimes do that with God, where I demand a heaven sent miracle rather than, uh, that what it is that I am seeing.

And, and the point I think that Mark is reminding us of today is that, well, God doesn't actually sin. You know, miracles from heaven, uh, God, uh, you know, performs miracles on earth. Um, that, uh, that God, uh, gives us the signs, they're right in front of us. Uh, God gives us the signs of God's with God's presence with us through very concrete, very.

Earthy acts of compassion and justice. And so we, if our, if we're looking for all these mystical, magical signs from God, well that's not the way God is. So don't look signs. I think that's the first point I want to suggest to us. [00:15:00] Don't look for signs from heaven. 'cause God gives us signs right here. In very, in fleshed ways through the hands and, and, and, uh, and, and, uh, and feet of, of, of people who are trying to bring about God's compassion and justice.

Well, I wanted to then take us to the, the, the next point that I see in here and, and, and tell you about, uh, one little thing or we have a, a translation problem into our English, uh, the, the actual text that's in, in, that's presented before you in the. The new revised standard version, or the common English Bible, almost all English versions, um, have an unfortunate translation.

They, they, they take the word loaf that's there and, and, uh, translate it into the word bread. But, but I'm presenting to you, uh, sympathy I think is quite important. The literal translation from the Greek of this text, 'cause I think it's quite important. It says that the disciples had forgotten to bring [00:16:00] loaves.

Had none except for one loaf with them in the boat. And they were discussing the fact that they had no loaves. And Jesus perceived us and said to them, why do you discuss the fact that you have no loaves? As I said, our English translations just simply take those, those, uh, those words and translate loaves into bread, but.

But, uh, mark, uh, in, in an interesting way, makes a contrast between a singular loaf and these multiple loaves, and I think that's important to some of the work of art that he was doing. I, I think that, uh, it's not hard for us to comprehend this. Uh, if you can imagine disciples along there say, Hey, we have this one loaf.

How can we possibly do what Jesus is expecting to do? This is, this is all we have. And I, I'm reminded, um, that, um. So often I have been in a situation where I have said, you know, I would be really successful, [00:17:00] I would be really flourishing if only these things were true. I've heard in, in our own congregation, us saying, you know, we would be really flourishing if we weren't so tired.

If we weren't so old. There really isn't enough for us to do the things that God is calling us to do. We, those were the old days. We, the, the new days don't look so bright for us, but often we. We say these things, and I would thrive only if, uh, if these things were true. We do this in our own, in our own relationships.

My marriage would be great. If only my spouse was more like this and a little less like that, then, then, then I would be fine. We would flourish and, and we say the same thing in our workplace, whether it's in the volunteer worlds that we occupy many of us today as retirees or. In the workplace, uh, where we're earning our living, that man, I, I would be such a success.

Things would be so good if only I did not have such a crazy boss, or if only my colleagues had more courage or my colleagues had the, the [00:18:00] competence that, that I have. Or, uh, if, if. If only things were different, but all I have is this, this one thing, this is what my reality is. And, but this reality is insufficient.

I can't, I can't flourish. We also say that I think as a country, we've been saying that an awful lot lately. We're very for lo I think as a country, because we feel our division much like they did in Palestine in those days. Uh, the division. Between the Herodians who were, who were saying, this is the way we become a flourishing Israel.

We, we unite with these old Greek ways, we unite with the Roman ways. We embrace them, we become more like them. That's the path we're, you know, versus the Pharisees and we're saying, no, no, no, no, no. He do the op. We, uh, we provide, uh, we, we follow these very exclusive social boundaries and we protect them. We draw back from engagement, uh, uh, with the [00:19:00] world.

Uh, and that's the way we maintain our purity and that's the way God will love us. Well, that same conflict we see in our country today. I don't need to document all those ways, but we have such a social divide that we often articulate in terms of red states and blue states and how, if, if, if only. If only those red states would adopt our blue state ways, and if only those blue states would adopt our red state ways, uh uh, then, then, then we would be America again.

We'd go back to this, this period of nostalgia we have when it was all, all right, the way things, you know, golden era as though there was a golden era in America where things were all right. And so we say we would own, we would thrive if only this was not our reality. Yeah, sometimes we're just like those disciples who, who say, we have only this loaf.

We don't have the many loaves we need, therefore we can't flourish. And into [00:20:00] that, we see Jesus making this distinction. He, first of all, the part that's in this text that I find interesting, uh, after the Jesus, after the, after they're having this discussion, is Jesus interrupts him and very sharply, uh, um, corrects them, chastises them, says Hey.

Watch out, watch out. Be alert for the leaven of the Pharisees, as well as the leaven of Herod. Watch out for that. So isn't that an interesting, uh, insertion into a commentary? I. About bread. We don't have any loaves. We only have this one loaf. We don't have many loaves. And Jesus says to them, watch out. Be on your guard for the loven of the Pharisees and the Loven of Herod, as though Mark is telling us that somehow the loven of the Pharisees and the love of Herod lead us to not see our reality, uh, in a true way.

Watch out for that. It will lead you astray. Jesus is saying. So Jesus [00:21:00] overheard their conversation and he knew what they were talking about, and he says, why are you saying you don't have any bread? Don't you see what has happened? Don't you get it? Are your hearts so resistant to what God is doing right in front of you?

Don't you have eyes? Why can't you see? Don't you have ears? And I love this. Don't you remember? Which is the word that's there. Don't you remember? Don't you remember? And that would leads us back to something Jesus is saying that in very clear language. Moses said, when I. All of the tribes of Israel were gathered right there on that Jordan River about to enter the promised land when God made this new covenant with them and Moses said, Hey, you've just been through this wilderness period in your life so long.

You saw what God did, you've seen with your own eyes. Everything the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh, his [00:22:00] servants in all his land, the great trials, your eyes witnessed those awesome signs and wonders. Until this very moment, the Lord hasn't given you insight to understand eyes, to see our ears to hear. In other words, Jesus is evoking this very famous gospel text this, the story about the covenant that God made remade at Moab and saying through the disciples, are you.

Like those people that Moses warned us, we might be with no eyes to see, no ears to hear what God is doing right in your sight. Don't you understand? And I think what Mark is telling us is that we need to make sure that we don't allow that single loaf that we see and we're holding in our hands to blind us to the many loaves.

That God provides the super abundant harvest that God is [00:23:00] always providing, has always provided, is providing and will always provide so that we might flourish. Don't you get that? That that's who God is, that, that through the all your wilderness, the wilderness wanderings of your life, have you not learned a thing that.

Throughout the wilderness, God is always present, guiding you through it, getting you to this point at the Promised land so that you might do God's will. And, uh, I, I think there's one other thing that Mark is telling us here and reminding us, uh, that when we're struggling in that boat and think that we have one loaf, the way that God saves us is through the gift of memory.

And I wanna remind you of this as we contemplate the Eucharist where Jesus says, do this for the remembrance of me. Remembrance of me. Jesus saves us not with miracles, they give us signs, but with [00:24:00] the gift of memory of who God is and who we are in relation to God. He saves us by leading us to remember the loaves that God has provided throughout the wilderness wildernesses of our lives and, and we remember how he has called us into this new social order in which all our.

Alienated social factions are reconciled in him into one loaf, one indivisible humanity incorporated into his body. So that though, all we have in our boat is one loaf. We can trust that that one loaf will always be sufficient for our boundary crossing journeys. And I think that's the good news that, that Jesus helps us to see.

The thing that I so often forget, uh, whenever I test my wife or test my brothers and beg [00:25:00] someone to, um. Show me that they are in solidarity with me. They gives us the big picture by saying, remember, remember how I have always been with you? Why would you be confused as you look at this moment at this one thing that's your hand and not see?

The signification of my promise to always be with you. So Jesus says, do this for the remembrance of me, the gift of memory, whereby we remember how beloved we are, how God has promised never to abandon us and never has, and never will. And so though we are called to do these boundary crossing journeys in our lives that are scary, we're, we're called to cross seas of, of, uh, of disorder and chaos.

And, and in order to then be a part of this reconciling coalition of humanity that Jesus is building, though we [00:26:00] may feel alone at times and feel that we cannot possibly flourish 'cause we don't have enough. When we remember who God has been. Who Jesus is, what all that he has given and that, that even though there is one loaf, he provides many loaves, many fish so that all may eat well.

Then we have calls for hope, don't we? We recognize that we, that our vision is obscured. We're just not seeing the world the way it really is, and therefore we can go into the world that's before us hopefully. Knowing that in spite of our red state, blue state differences, in spite of our Louisiana, Tennessee differences, in spite of our all the things that make us different, God is creating something extraordinarily beautiful in our midst.

May you have the eyes that help you to see that this is true. And then have the peace and joy right now that God intends for you [00:27:00] in that knowledge. As you break bread with each other today at home and with your friends in the coming days, do that in remembrance of him so that you might know his abundant joy in the name of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit.

Amen. I.
