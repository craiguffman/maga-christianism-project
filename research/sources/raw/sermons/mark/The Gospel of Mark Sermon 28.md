# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 28

[00:00:00] Hello folks. Today we continue in our close reading of the Gospel. Mark, if you've been with us in the past several months, you know, we've been trying to understand what Mark, uh, is trying to tell us about who Jesus is, both for him and for us through his gospel, uh, the earliest gospel. Uh, and, and by.

Being faithful to Mark's effort by recognizing that he has used incredible art in. Generating this wonderful story, this wonderful portrait of Jesus, uh, that is our focus. So today we get to a very important point, a very important part of that story. We have been, uh, you know, worked through from the first chapter all the way through the 10th chapter and today.

Uh, I want to begin by reminding you of something that we spoke about last June. Uh, something that, uh, that I, I [00:01:00] spoke to you about on June 9th, in fact, and that has to do with what, uh, how Mark understood Jesus's, uh, messianic mission, uh, and, and thereby how he understood. Understands the mission of US disciples.

And what I want to get at is we spoke about at that time on June 9th, uh, the notion of powers that become demonic. We saw that the Messiah, Jesus, that was, was taking on the institutions, uh, that were preventing the people of Israel from being, uh, the Messianic people. They were called to be the, the chosen people.

Um. And, uh, we, we talked about, uh, the fact that they had become distorted and that again and again, those institutions, whether it was the, you know, the, the, the, uh, state, the, the, you know, the, the, uh, Greek temple in Jerusalem, or even the practices of. [00:02:00] Of, uh, Judaism as taught by the scribes, and particularly by the party called the Pharisees, had become, uh, distorted.

And so we, we, we talked at the time that when a power pursues a vocation other than the one for which God created it and makes its own interests the highest good, well then that power we say, becomes demonic. Now, Jesus, of course, is, uh, throughout the beginning of the gospel taking all of those types of powers.

On. We see him taking it on in the, the temple. We see him taking it on in the synagogue. We see him taking it on in the marketplace. Uh, and you, and you, we see him also, uh, teaching their first sets of disciples, uh, how to carry on his ministry. And that task that he's, he turns over to us is that of unmasking the idolatry and recalling those powers to their created purposes in the world.

And as I spoke about it at the time, uh, what you get here is what today [00:03:00] we, we, I would characterize as the Protestant principle. That is to say, uh, the, the principle that we always challenge, that which is received to, to see if our idolatry has creeped in. And so that we are. Reformed and always reforming as one author once put it.

The other point that Mark has made is that, uh, along the way of love, which, uh, just is the way of the cross, we receive eyes to see and the power to conquer the powers in Jesus' name. And one of the classic examples of that, uh, is of course, uh, they're, uh, exercising. They're, they're doing exorcisms, uh, in his name after prayer.

And then another one is, uh, their participation in, uh, the feeding of many. From, uh, the bread and the fishes that, uh, were presented. So today we, we reach an important part with that background, we re we re we reach an important part of our story because what we see is a great [00:04:00] candidate for the team of disciples arrives in the midst.

It's quite interesting. Uh, this is, uh. Uh, uh, the kind of guy that you, you hope, you know, you hope will rise on your team. You know, I'm thinking of, uh, when a, when an NFL team, uh, receives, you know, the first round draft pick there, you know, that person rise with great excitement and, and hopeful hope that, uh, great things will come from that purpose.

And, and this, uh, candidate, I think must have been one of those. Uh, it says that he, as Jesus was setting out on a journey, uh, this man ran up. Knelt before him. That's important. He knelt before him. He got into the posture of a disciple and he asked him, good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

And, uh, that of course raises a couple of questions. He, he first of all talks about the word inherent. He uses the word inherit or to obtain, uh, to be entitled to. So he's asking, he's presuming that, uh, there is a means by which one becomes. An heir that there's [00:05:00] a means by which one becomes entitled to this thing he calls eternal life.

What is this thing called Eternal life? We've spoken about that a lot here. Um. And as I've pointed out again and again, eternal life is not a place, it's not a place up in the clouds. It's not a status. Uh, it's, it is a relationship. Uh, it is a relationship with God. If we've, we've spoken about, you know, the word eternal means to be.

Uh, uh, to, to be that which transcends time and space. And of course, you and us humans are, are, uh, you and I are, uh, are bound by time in space in our finitude. Well, that which is eternal transcends that, uh, those boundaries. Uh, and uh, and, and so the other word that's in that phrase is life. And if we've spoken up before, life biblically, uh, is not merely the capacity to steam up a mirror.

It's not, uh, the capacity of others to, uh, measure your heart rate, uh, to determine [00:06:00] whether you were alive. No. To be alive is to be in relationship with God, uh, to, uh, be able to have so eternal life would be able to experience a relationship with God, uh, that transcends time and space. In other words, it would conquer.

The, the, the finitude that we experience and overcome that. Uh, and that's what he's saying. He's asking about, what do I need to do to be ENT entitled to such a life? Well, Jesus didn't reply the way you might think. Uh, the man's, uh, language, many commentators had said, you know, by calling Jesus good teacher.

That was a very unusual greeting. Others in the Bible refer to him as Rauni rabbi, uh, which means teacher, but here he preface it with an adjective, good teacher. And many commentators have noticed, uh, that that fits into a well-known framework within the, the, uh, the eastern. World, uh, that, that we don't occupy, and where in which when you, um, you know, engage in flattery of, of another, [00:07:00] uh, you know, the, the etiquette of the time would require them to, uh, reciprocate with such flattery.

And, uh, and Jesus doesn't do that. Jesus instead says, why do you call me good? No one is good, but God alone, that's a very important point. This man, uh, we'll see later seems to think of himself like Jesus as being good. But Jesus points out that no one is good, but God alone. Uh, so to think of ourselves as good is problematic.

Um, then Jesus, uh, uh, begins to teach the man. Uh, he says, well, you, you know the answer that you're seeking. You know, the commandments. And he did Jesus. List several of them. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. You shall not defraud. Honor your father and mother.

Now, he, he leaves out the, the commandment about the Sabbath and he, and he, and he leaves out the one about do not covet, but [00:08:00] he says, instead he substitutes one that we don't actually see in the, in, uh, in, in Exodus. He says, you shall not defraud, which. Uh, would be something that someone who's wealthy might be capable of doing.

Defrauding was not a concern of the people who had no property. Defrauding was something that was a concern. It was the thing that, uh, uh, uh, Jesus criticized the wealthy for doing. And so, uh, in. In feeding back to the man, he, the 10 commandments. He, he, he, uh, posits the, you shall not covet, I would suggest in this term of not defrauding.

And the man, of course, listens to that and knows those things. And he says to him, teach here. I have kept all these since my youth. Now we might read right past that, but I wanna ask you to pause for a second and recognize what he's saying here. And he's saying, well, if that's what it's. If that's what's necessary to have eternal life, well then I've checked every box 'cause I am a good person.

Um, you know, that's what seems to be implied here. I've kept all these things and so [00:09:00] I, I, uh, am entitled to this gift, this reward. Um, I, I mentioned that and I emphasized this idea of good in Jesus', uh, pausing and, and, and say, why do you call me good? Only God is good because I've, I've, um, had so many encounters with folks who say that they don't really need to know much about Jesus.

They don't really need to follow Jesus so much. The important thing of being a Christian is simply to be a good person, and then they say to me often, well, I'm good. I'm a good person. As though the point was to be whatever society says is a good person rather than discipleship, rather than following. The one who shows us the way to be fully human.

Jesus. And Jesus points here that none of us are capable of being good, none of us, uh, uh, understand what it means to be, to be good, except when we put our cast, our eyes [00:10:00] on the source of all goodness, our our father. Uh, so he said to him, teach you. I've kept these things, all these things since my youth.

Well, at that point. Jesus then calls the man out, if I use that word, uh, intentionally. Uh, we, we use that phrase here to, you know, in our time to say, to suggest that we're, we're going to, uh, point out the untruthfulness of, of someone's, uh. Posturing, uh, to call him out. But it, but it, but Jesus did that, but at the same time, he did what the Bible describes when it talks about assembling the church.

He, you know, the word ecclesia means the, you know, the assembly, the, the people called out, called out of their ways of being and into this new way of walking the way of love. And Jesus called him out. Uh, at this time by looking at him carefully and loving him, Jesus looked deeply into the man's soul and he says he [00:11:00] speaks to the man in names.

Uh, what is problematic in the man, in his, in his particularity. Jesus saw the man as he truly was. And uh, I'd like to say that he called him by name in the sense that he, he saw what was lacking in the man and he said, you are lacking one thing. Go. Sell what you own and give the money to the poor, then you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me.

Well, at this point, the man was as the, as the Bible puts it, as the text puts it, dismayed, gloomy at this statement. And he went away, uh, dis, you know, saddened. Why? Because he had many possessions. This was something obviously Jesus knew, Jesus saw. Um, and, and I, I think that Mark, uh, shares this story at this stage where he's been teaching, he's been sharing the recollections of Jesus, teaching the [00:12:00] disciples what life along the way would be.

Uh, and, and he, he shares this story, I think as Jesus is beginning to turn towards his own. Uh, final journey to Jerusalem, uh, with a, with an eye to, uh, demonstrating what Jesus meant in that parable. That we know as the parable of the sower where, where Jesus explained about how the seed that is broadcast, the seed is the word, and the word will be broadcast in many places.

It'll be broadcast everywhere, but not all, all of it will be fruitful. And he explains that one particular case, and I think this is one of the cases that Mark is illustrating here. Back in chapter four, verse 18 through 19, we see, and others are those sewn, meaning other seeds are those sewn among the thorns.

These seeds are the ones who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke the world. The [00:13:00] word, and it yields nothing. Disciples, of course. Hear this and they're shocked. This was a, this was someone who was obviously, would've been, it seemed to them a great asset, uh, to the team.

And Jesus sends him away, uh, uh, to go deal with the thing that is in his way. Uh, so Jesus looked around and, and he, he looked at his disciples very carefully and he said, Hey, it's very hard for the wealthy to enter God's kingdom. And, and, and, and Mark tells us that this, this idea of it being. Hard to, for the wealthy to enter God's kingdom startled the disciples.

Why did it startle them? Because that wasn't the understanding of, of, uh, of classical Judaism. The understanding of Judaism was that God prospered the ones who were most holy. That, that, uh, that if I see that you are prospering, what I see is that God favors you, uh, and so that there's a correlation [00:14:00] between wealth and goodness.

That was a presumption within Judaism. Uh, then, and, and it's a presumption among, um, among many Christians today, we call it the Protestant work ethic in Geneva. Uh, in Calvin's time. Uh, they developed this understanding that, uh, if you're not prospering, well that's a sign of. Of, uh, that, that you in some way are doing something that is unfavorable to God.

If you're prospering. Uh, if you're working really, really hard, uh, then God will prosper you and therefore your prosperity is a sign of, of God's, uh, favored, uh, look upon you. Uh, so, so his words just startled the disciples, so Jesus told them again, a proverb this time. It's a children, it's difficult to enter God's kingdom.

It's easier for a Campbell to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom. Wow folks. That's, [00:15:00] uh, that's, uh, quite an image. Now, what Jesus is doing there is he's quoting a well-known proverb. Yes, it, it appears in the Bible, but that's not the first place it appeared.

It was a, it was a well-known, um, rabbinic, uh, proverb. And it was a proverb that was adapted, that was a. Adapted to the, the region. So we see in it, it's, it's, it's more difficult for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle. Classically, it was more difficult for an elephant through to squeeze through the eye of a needle.

This is something in the ancient times, it was quite frequently said. Uh, and what's what's meant by that is that it's impossible. It's impossible. So Jesus is saying it is impossible for the wealthy to enter God's kingdom. What does this, what does this mean? Well, I, I think what, uh, Jesus has been teaching us is that our desire for belongingness can become so great that [00:16:00] we conform to norms, the norms of our community, even if those norms lead us off the way, the lure of wealth, Jesus calls it in, in Mark.

Chapter four verse 19. You know, we, we, uh, we, we. Yearn to be a part of community in the, and we yearn to have status in that community. And the means of status, uh, very often is, uh, the achievement of great wealth. Um, and so like the man, we would rather check boxes that signify our goodness. Then stay with Jesus on the way.

If staying with Jesus on the way means relinquishing our view of our wealth, our view of our property, the property that is accumulated in our hands over time. And as such, we become possessed by the signs of our wealth and begin to believe that those [00:17:00] possessions signify our achievement of eternal life.

And Jesus says therefore. It's impossible. Impossible for a wealthy person to, to enter the kingdom of God, to be, to enter into the dominion of God. Um, but then it continues, turns out it's impossible for us to do that on our own, but it's not impossible for God. You see, the disciples were shocked. Even more when Jesus said this and they said to each other, well, Jesus, then who can be saved?

And Jesus looked at them careful and he said, it's impossible with human beings, but not with God. All things are possible for God. How can that be true? Well, mark continues the story. He recalls that Peter said to Jesus, look, we've left everything and followed you. And then he. Talks [00:18:00] about the various sacrifices of the disciples gathered around Jesus.

Well, folks, uh, Peter Fibbed, that's not quite true. You see? Peter and John and James, the, the, the, the Sons of Thunder, the son, the brothers of Zebedee, uh, they, they still can, you know, the scripture shows us they, they, they left their nets, but they kept their boats, their boats we see again and again are used to.

As the means of transportation for the people who walked away. And, and Peter's house, his mother's house was the meeting place. And, and we see throughout scripture the stories of how people of means, uh, used that means to carry on. They dedicated it, they consecrated that, that wealth and, you know, for the use of the folks upon the way so that they might bring, uh, the gospel, uh, into the world.

And so, uh, they didn't have to. Uh, give up everything. They just needed to [00:19:00] learn to see everything in a new way. And what I'm speaking of here is an understanding of what it means to enter into the kingdom of God, which is what has been our subject for the last, uh, several weeks. Um, and I've suggested several times that the best thing, best way for us to translate this notion of kingdom of God is in our own language, to think in terms of the reign of God, the dominion of God.

When God has dominion over our hearts, when God reigns in our hearts, well then we walk along the way. And so when we have eternal fellowship with God. Eternal fellowship with God. That means we remain in a position so that God speaks into our lives. God addresses us and we respond and we, we address God.

And God responds and, and, and walking on the le the way, uh, means walking in such a way that we have this fellowship with God such that God [00:20:00] reigns in our hearts. We begin to will. God wills for us. We begin to will the good that God, uh, desires for us. So lemme ask you a question. What if eternal fellowship with God just is unconditional surrender to God's reign, meaning giving up, surrendering all, all title.

To the things that we have in our lives and dedicating those to God's purposes for the world. What if welcoming the dominion of God means learning to see that we've been given the gift of remembering we are beloved, so that we might incarnate that gift for others and our possessions are part of that story.

What if welcoming the dominion of God means learning to see All we have as gifts we are to steward. And to offer as instruments of God's presence in the world. [00:21:00] Let me ask you, to what extent do you see your possessions as yours to enjoy as you see fit rather than as instruments of grace with which you are to bless others as you have been and will be blessed, Jesus said.

I assure you, and in response to Peter's question, I assure you that anyone who has left house brothers, sisters, mothers, father, children, or farms, because of me and because of the good news, will receive 100 times as much. Now in this life, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and farms with persecution, and in the coming age, life eternal, but.

Many who are first, will be last, and many who are last will be first. As I go about the great reversal as I go about the process of conquering evil, you will [00:22:00] prosper not perhaps in the way you imagined. So what is the good news? Well, I, I think part of the good news folks is that we can't force either an elephant or a camel through a needle.

That's good news. It's impossible for us to inherit a relationship that transcends time and space with God. Uh, to, to, to be entitled to that. No, we have to actually participate in Jesus' life to participate in the, that life along the way. We can't earn it. We can't, uh, check a box or check many boxes in order to gain it.

God, however, can liberate us from the astigmatism of sin that makes us see our possessions as proof of our goodness and see to see in seeing our property, uh, as something to be treasured in our own private spaces. You know, God cures our blindness and helps [00:23:00] us to see our possessions. As, as what they really are, as as part of God's gifts to us, so that we might be the gift.

God gives us the gift of eyes to see that our possessions are entrusted to us as means of grace, as a means of manifesting gr god's. Presence in the world for all. And so when we see our possessions, rightly, when we, uh, have our vision restored, we are liberated and able to walk away. This was the man's problem.

He was blinded by his possessions. And folks, the good news is that when we walked away. God reigns in our lives and we thereby experience the relationship with God that transforms our human boundaries and transcends our human boundaries of time and space. And that's what it means to be fully human. And that's sad that the man walked away.

Dismayed. Uh, this [00:24:00] is an important story because we're gonna see in, uh, the coming week. A story of another man who was blind, uh, whose story ended in a different way. You'll hear the rest of that story next week. In the name of the Father and of the Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
