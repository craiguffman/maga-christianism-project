# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 6

[00:00:00] Good morning folks. Today we are gonna continue in our study of the Gospel of Mark as, uh, you've just heard Judi, uh, Judy's, uh, wonderful reading of of that text. Uh, Jesus today is, uh, continuing his in assault on the symbolic order. Last week we talked about how he, uh, engaged the scribes and, and, uh, their ways of, um.

Actually leading people away from God's will, uh, in their effort to enforce God's will. And this week we see, uh, his engagement of our own pharisaic way. So, uh, I, I recognize that when I talk about groups, uh, certain groups like the Pharisees, sades, the Essenes, et cetera. Uh, these are somewhat unfamiliar to us.

In fact, they have not been, um, something we, uh, Christians have really understood much about since the times of our lives. About the time that, uh, many of us were [00:01:00] born, uh, scholarship, uh, uh, in, in, uh, religious history, was able to, to learn. You know, tremendous amounts about who these groups were through the discovery of external writings and through methods that, uh, looked at that, that adjust the world around them and, and what they wrote and what they saved, such that we became to a, a, a much better understanding of these groups.

And today I wanted to focus particularly on two of them. Jesus is going to, uh, ex particularly engage in these three stories, the Pharisees, but, uh, we can't really understand. The Pharisees without understanding the ones who were in power, the establishment. And that group was known as the Sadducees and the, and the background of our stories, of all these stories in the gospel of Mark is their struggle for political power throughout Palestine and throughout Judaism.

Um, so let's talk a little bit about the [00:02:00] Sadducees first. Uh, they were the oligarchs who ran the temple complex, which meant they had control of the temple itself and the temple army and the temple. Uh. Economic structure, which was the banking center of Israel. These were the elite of their society. They were the landed gentry.

They had consolidated the land that was given to all the people through various means that, uh, uh, were, were often criticized by the prophets. But, uh, over time they had, uh, taken over, uh, the, uh, management of the temple complex that they, so they were the chief priests and the chief priest families. And basically the Office of Chiefs chief priest, uh, rotated among these families for a couple of hundred years.

Uh, so they were very much the top, uh, of, of, of folks. And they, and they, they, they were. Uh, a group that believed that, uh, the power of the symbolic order, the power of the [00:03:00] means of grace was controlled by the, uh, the, um, top of, of the, uh, purity, uh, hierarchy. If you recall last week, I showed you some charts that talked, uh, that showed how, uh, they ordered their sus their, their culture in a variety of ways, one of which was the ordering of.

Things. And at the very highest of, uh, the, the very highest valued thing was the priest in terms of purity. And so the Sadducees, uh, being the, at the top of that hierarchy in their families, uh, interestingly enough, believed that only they could, uh, uh, satisfy the purity codes of of Leviticus of, of Torah.

And comply. And that meant that they got to, uh, determine whether or not others were complying as well. And an interesting example to show the tension between the the Sadducees and the Pharisees involves, uh, something very mundane. The um. The rules governing seed and [00:04:00] grain and what you can consume, which bread you can consume.

And you find that in Leviticus eight, excuse me, Leviticus 1138, where it talks about seed. And uh, and of course if you can imagine seed that is in the field, plants in the field, grain that is in the field, and you have animals, uh, that live and breathe and have their being. In nature. Well, they also have their death in nature and they fall onto fields.

And so you, you encounter this, this question about what do we do about things that encounter dead bodies? And so the reasoning, uh, that, that come through the rabbinical reflections on Torah, uh, that, that arrive, that, that, that we see here in Leviticus 11, uh, it had to do with whether seed was clean or unclean.

If seed is. Clean then, then, uh, the fruit of that seed, the bread made from that seed weaken. Um, the, the bread made from the, the grain that is produced from that seed then was, was clean. But if, if it, if it says here, but if water is poured on some scene and [00:05:00] part of the, of those dead bodies falls on it, well then it's unclean for you Now that through centuries of reflection, but by, by the scribes of, of Israel.

Uh, produced a, a, uh, a great debate on in terms of, of, of thinking about, well, what bread can we eat? Uh, is there some bread that's just inherently unclean? And so the Sadducees and the Pharisees, this is just one example, disagreed on this point. And so the Sadducees in elites, um, uh, believed that, uh, you, you don't distinguish between seed that is planted in the soil and the seed as that is detached from the soil.

Now. What does that mean? Well, when you had a poor harvest due to warfare or due to drought, uh, general causation of famine or just market conditions where you have, you have poor harvest that make the, the, the, the grain of Israel very expensive for the poor person. Well, what do you do in that situation?

Well, you guys will remember what did, uh, [00:06:00] Jacob do when Joseph, uh. Was seeded at the head of Egypt. Well, you import grain from Egypt and that's what was traditionally done. They'd get grain from a different source just as we do today when we have shortage of things. You know, for example, like semiconductors today.

Oh, but, but grain that's grown in Egypt presents a problem if you're thinking about our purity code because, uh, the Egyptians. Uh, a Egyptian agriculture was different. They irrigated their fields and that meant their seeds were touched with water. That was, that was, uh, uh, a, a problem between the two ruling, uh, you know, the, the elites, uh, because to the Sadducees.

That meant that Egyptian grain was unclean by definition, and that anyone who consumed it, uh, would also be unclean and therefore responsible for fulfilling the restoration requirements, having to go through all the processor. If you talked about, remember last week we talked about how that would meant if I'm in Galilee and eight day walk to [00:07:00] the temple.

To present myself to whom someone that's in the Sadducees and party, uh, who could then receive my gift from you, consume it themselves, and then declare me clean. Um, and, and so in this time of poor harvest, the Sadducees says, well, the Egyptian grain that you want to import is unclean. So if you import it, you're going to have to, um, you're, you're going to have to, uh, go through this.

Ritual, uh, process by which you were rendered clean again. Now, that was, uh, that was real interesting because the Sian parties, of course, were the land owners. They, um, they were the elite who had consolidated ownership of the land, and so they were the ones who had. Uh, uh, uh, the, you know, they, their, their wealth increased in times of poor harvest because the price of grain went up, which meant the price of their land went up.

And so their attitude about importing grain is not unlike our attitude towards tariffs in our own land, wanting tariffs on [00:08:00] foreign goods. You know, it functioned in the same way they prospered, uh, in, in times of poor harvest because the value of their own holdings went up and they could afford them to take this religious.

Perspective. That said, you can't eat that grain, and of course you can imagine the impact that would have on the people of the land. That is Jesus's primary concern. When we talk about Jesus having a preferential option for the poor. We're talking about Jesus having this preferential option for the people of the land.

Pharisees, on the other hand, had a different perspective as they, as they. Wondered about why it seemed that they, that Israel, the Jews continued in exile from God, in other words, continued, continued under the hands of the oppressor. They answered that question by saying, well, it's clear. It's because we've not obeyed God's instruction.

And so the answer to, you know, to our dilemma, the, you know, if we want to get back in the grace of God so that we feel and experience God's daily presence in our lives, we [00:09:00] must, as a people become more pure. Uh, they were skeptical of these usurers to the priesthood that would, that now had, had, uh, has since the Hasson and Dynasty, uh, had control of the Temple Elite.

And so the, the Pharisees were a very broad political party. They were divided among themselves, actually. So they, they had a great spectrum, much as we do today in our, in our, uh, political left. Um, uh, they. They, uh, but they, they tried to attack the control over Israel's, uh, means of grace by extending and, and think, rethinking the way you thought about how we are pure before God.

And so they. Extended the purity code, uh, to the people of the land and said, it's not just the, the, the Sadducees themselves and the priests themselves who, who, who have the power to make themselves clean, but so do the ordinary people as long as they follow certain rules. And we talked [00:10:00] about last week how these rules are.

That can be generally categor categorized in terms of rule that, that make times wholly, that make special things wholly, such as our table fellowship and food. And so we get the idea of kosher salt and kosher, this and that, uh, and then special marks such as whether or not you're circumcised or not. And so if you, you know, as you know, uh, these are all gonna be things that, that, that we, Christians are gonna.

Squabble over as we think about what it means to be Christian because we arise from this pharisaic party. We, Christians arise from this Pharisaic party. So they were actually trying to liberalize it and free, um, Judah of the, the oppression of the Sadducees. By extending it, but they went about it with these very elaborate interpolations of Torah, uh, and, and, and, and, and, and so they actually intensified the rules and made it so that the people of the land could follow them.

But the, but they [00:11:00] themselves were the ones who were able, the, these scribes of the Pharisees were the ones that were able to adjudicate to determine, are you or are you not living in, in accordance with our oral traditions By which, um. We extend the franchise to the means of grace beyond the temple complex.

And uh, and so when they looked at, uh, Leviticus 1138, they said, well, no, that only applies to seed that has been detached from the soil. So of course, you can still be observant of God's instruction while you eat bread made from Egyptian grain. So, uh, this is just one example of how the Sadducees and the Pharisees, um.

Competed for, for power. Now, the, the, the Sadducees, I mean, excuse me, the Pharisees in particular were constituted by what's known as the artisan class. This would be the bureaucrats, uh, that, that, uh, ran, uh, many of the, the administrative functions, uh, throughout both, [00:12:00] uh. Judah and gile, uh, but also would include the, the, the vast majority of the people, the, the, you know, Pharisees would, could, could also be, uh, the, the, the peasantry, uh, who would've been trained and taught and gathered, uh, together, uh, and interpreting the, in interpreting God's word.

Uh, and as I said, they, they. Produced this, uh, extension of, of the means of grace. But they also produced these rules that determine whether or not you were in compliance. And it was a political move that really didn't have great, uh, affinity, great solidarity with the people of the land because what it in fact did was made the Pharisees, it just shifted the power from the Sadducees to the people who were Pharisees, who were the ones who.

Who, uh, were, were able to determine whether or not you were adhering to, uh, God's instruction or not. And so they could be very easily and very often did, would say, you are clean, you are not. So it was just a shifting, uh, you know, of the zip code of, of who, [00:13:00] uh, determined where you were located and the hierarchy of human value.

That they simply recreated and extended geographically. And so what we see are the, the, what we see is this ideology that Jesus is going to attack. And we ourselves have these same tendencies, and some of them, uh, overlap. Uh, we have these very similar things in our ideologies. One of the ideologies, uh, that many of us grew up with, uh, since the 1980s, uh, was this notion that, uh, it goes back to actually Rockefeller, uh, not Rockefeller, uh, Goldwater.

Um, you know, that, that, uh, that, uh, big government is bad and taxes are inherently evil. Any sort of tax increase in the people is defacto evil. That's all we need to know. Is it a tax or not? And that's an example of the sadian, uh, thinking that is very much self-serving because the ones who hold this ideology tend to be the people who are gonna profit, uh, from.

The poor harvest like the Es [00:14:00] did. Uh, they already have their table filled with the abundance of God's grace. Uh, and so the, the uh, um, you know, they are in a position to say that taxes, that, that share the wealth of, of, of the, of the. Of the banquet with all, uh, are inherently evil. Uh, and also another example is this prioritization that, that we do where we, we, we say that law in order is a greater priority at times over our bread sharing.

Now I. One of the fair say impulses that we see an awful lot on both sides of the political spectrum today is this notion of wokeness in which we're able to say that these people over there have not sufficiently complied and they therefore they are to be silenced. They, they, they have not complied with whatever our value is, whether it has to do with how we speak and treat women, or whether it has to do, uh, [00:15:00] with some sort of radicalism, insufficient radicalism with some sort of economic, uh, ideology.

So what we, we have tended to do is to create these rules that we interpolate and then silence those and say they're no longer in our communion because they have. Cross that line. They're unclean and you guys are familiar with that. I don't think, uh, you engage in it, but it's something that we see an awful lot of to an usual extent in our country today.

But interestingly enough, it's also a very much a fair sake thing to, to, you know, just sort of shift, uh, the political power from, from one side to the other, but still having this prioritization of, of law in order politics. Over this mandate for companionship companion, meaning literally the being with somebody through the sharing of our own bread.

And so those are, those are ideologies, those are aspects of our life that, uh, apply today. And I, I wanna remind us of that. 'cause we, we get into the [00:16:00] story. I, I hope that we can place ourselves today in the, in, in the location of the Pharisees as the ones whom Jesus is engaging. In, in speaking God's word to as he challenged p say, power.

And so the very first thing we see is the one that we ended with last week. That, that, uh, the scribes of the Pharisees, you remember the scribes could be Pharisees or scribes, could be Sadducees, uh, but the scribes of the Pharisees saw that Jesus was hanging out with all the wrong people. He was violating.

In other words, the purity code he was eating with sinners and tax collectors. And I said, why is he doing that? Why is he violating our code? He is he insufficiently woke. When Jesus heard this, he said to them, I. A, a, a proverb, a very common proverb of his time. Actually. We see the same proverb in Plutarch's descriptions of, of Greek, uh, uh, famous Greek folks about whom he wrote.

Uh, those who were well have no need of a physician, but those [00:17:00] who are sick, they're the ones who need the physician. And then he further, he, he, he, he, he makes a very interesting statement about his own mission, the way he saw his mission. I have come to call, not the righteous I. Sinners. Now, of course, the Pharisees saw themselves as the righteous.

So it begs the question, who are the righteous? Who are the sinners that Jesus is talking about? I wanna remind you, uh, mark, uh, was one of the ones who traveled with Paul. John Mark and, uh, and, and Paul wrote it to the church at Romans at about the same time that this gospel was being written. And he talked about this question of who are the righteous and who are the sinners?

And, and he, he's reflecting on the significance of Jesus and what he understood Jesus to have taught. And his reflection says this, that, uh, you know, under the law, with our emphasis on the law, uh, you know, uh. No human being will be treated as [00:18:00] righteous in God's presence by simply doing what the law says.

That's not what makes us righteous. And furthermore, Paul talks about the fact that it's the, the, the, the effect of Torah, the effect of the law is to make us aware of our own sinfulness, uh, knowledge of sin comes through the law. Uh, and so. He also says, uh, so now the righteous requirements necessary for life are met for everyone through what?

Not through the law, but through the righteous act of one person. One person, and Jesus. In other words, Paul is explaining Jesus's way of. Of being, his way of restoring all of us to table fellowship, the kind of table fellowship that God desires, not the kind of table fellowship the Pharisees were, uh, orchestrating.

And he, he's doing it by ex doing exactly what, uh, threatened them. So hanging out with all those people who had been, been isolated. [00:19:00] Isolated themselves. In the, in the, in the sense when we talk about sinners isolated themselves by their own behavior, their own immoral behavior, saying there is no one whose immoral behavior puts them beyond the reach of God's love, I.

Then, then Mark tells us about a story, uh, that, that didn't seem to happen, you know, right at the same time. But there was a complaint by the Pharisees about fasting. Uh, John's disciples, meaning John the Baptizers disciples, who still continued, uh. Uh, all the way through, at least, uh, through the fifties, uh, independently of, of Jesus's disciples.

Well, they fasted and so too, the Pharisees had quite ornate rules regarding fasting and, uh, and, and they noted that, uh, well, John's disciples fast and the Pharisees just fast. Why did not Jesus's. Disciples fast and they challenge, why are you not complying with the, the purity codes as we understand [00:20:00] them?

Now, these purity codes have to do with fasting, come from, again, God's instruction that we find in in, in Deuteronomy and in Leviticus and for example, Leviticus 16. Uh, talks about the one that is primary. We talked about making times holy certain times were more holy than any others. And, uh, the, the one that is most holy, the one that was required was the Day of Atonement.

And so in Leviticus 16, it talks about, uh, that on the, on the Day of Atonement, you must not do any work, neither the citizen nor the immigrant who lives among you. And on that day, and the purpose in those, this is explaining to us the purpose of this fasting on that day. And. Reconciliation will be made for you in order to cleanse you.

You will be made clean. You will be clean before the Lord from all your sins. It will be a sabbath of special rest for you, and you will deny yourselves. This is a permanent rule, and so the whole notion of fasting is something that is, uh, part of God's instruction. [00:21:00] And it's all about reconciliation and, uh, purity, uh, being the people, uh, called to draw all the, the, the world into God's love.

And there's certain days that scripture says, you know, everyone within Israel is to fast. One is that I just read to you this from the Day of Atonement, also on the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah. Uh, they were to fast, but other than that. There weren't required a lot of required days of fasting that were actually in Torah, except in the elaborate, uh, interpolations that had happened in the oral traditions that the Pharisees controlled.

And so the p sake behavior had developed over time a requirement that, uh, beyond the temple and such, uh, you fast every Tuesday and Thursday. Uh, so. They ask the question, you know, this is the law, this is the laws. As we understand it, why aren't you complying it? If you don't do this, then we are all at risk because we are, uh, not obeying what God expects of us.

And [00:22:00] so we're justified in, uh, in isolating you. I. And, uh, this was because this is the means by which we are clinging to by God, this fasting, it's one of the means. And Jesus has a great response. And, uh, and I, and I'm want to give you something of a literal translation here. You're familiar with the one about the wedding guests.

That's what the one says in the, in the, in the bulletin. But, but what it actually says is the sons of the bride chamber. Now, I want you to think about the sons and daughters of the bride chambers, the way we could parse it today. Are not able to fast when the bridegroom is with them. So who is the bridegroom?

Well, in Hosea, in Isaiah, in Song of Solomon and elsewhere in the Jewish tradition, uh, the bridegroom is Yahweh. Himself, himself. And uh, and so the bridegroom comes in, is in, in and is united and is one with the bride. And who is the bride? Well, Israel is the bride. All of Israel, they're understood to be that.

And so this notion of a marriage [00:23:00] between God and God's people is, is described with this metaphor of marriage. And so as we anticipate this union, when the bridegroom is present, you don't fast during that time. It's a time of celebration. There will be a time when the bridegroom will be taken away anticipating, uh, the story of the cross, but during this time, there's a different way that we are to be.

And Jesus sketched that. He says, don't you see this? This is something new happening. And he gives the example of the wineskins. No one sows a piece of shrunk cloth on an old clo cloak, otherwise the patch pulls away from it. The, the new. Pulls from the old and you have a, you have something that's even much worse and, and no one puts new wine into old wine skins.

Otherwise, the wine will burst. The skins. Jesus is saying there is something he's describing. What he's doing is something new. You Pharisees, don't you understand? When I sit with these sinners, when I sit with these folks who have been isolated, like the tax [00:24:00] collectors, I'm gathering all I am proclaiming God's kingdom, I'm gathering.

They're, they, they're all, all people into God's celestial banquet. So this is something new. Your old ways have no place here, and if you even try to, to combine the two, you'll burst the wine skin. And the result of all this going back to Romans of my gathering with you, gathering with all in table fellowship is that grace will rule.

Grace will rule through God's righteousness and leading to those restored relationships that are eternal. So then Mark continues. He tells even a third story, and this, not, this one has to do with the Sabbath, the, the, uh, it says one Sabbath. He was Jesus that is, was going through the grain fields, and, and as he and his disciples were, were walking through, they began to pluck heads of grain.

They were walking through these fields and the Farris, he said, Hey, [00:25:00] why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath? This goes back to some rules that, again, come from God's instruction. In Leviticus, there were some rules about how you harvested your fields. Uh, and this was a, a, a social security system for particularly widows and children and the poor.

It was a beautiful thing that was part of Israel that was unique in Israel, uh, relative to the, the, their. Um, they're neighbor neighboring countries. They're neighboring cultures. Uh, they, they, they did have a social security system that, that, that required by law, when you're harvest your land's, produce, you must not harvest all of it to the edge of your field.

Instead, leave it there. Leave those items on the edges of your field for the poor and the immigrant. For the poor and the immigrant. And why? Because I am your Lord. We say it says something very similar in, uh, [00:26:00] in Deuteronomy. It gives the right to, uh, the, the, the poor and the immigrant to glean from the field.

It says if you go into your neighbor's grain field. So it doesn't say, don't go into your neighbor's grain field. It, it preci supposes the right for you to do what Jesus and his disciples were doing. Go into your neighbor's grain field and you can pluck ears by hand, but you're not allowed to use a sight.

So you're not allowed to go harvest in, you know, mass production, but to satisfy hunger of the moment, you can pluck an ear of corn. So they had a social security system, if you will. That was a beautiful gift of God. Uh, that was part of God's instructions. There was also though, something that talked about honoring the Sabbath.

You should do your work for six days, but on the seventh day you should rest. It says in Exodus chapter 34, verse 21, even during plowing or harvest time, you are to rest. And that is the, the backdrop. And then you get this [00:27:00] pharisaic, uh, in interpolation and this oral tradition that develops and develops this.

And they come out with these rules that say you can't. You can't do any work, therefore you can't do any harvest. You can't feed yourself when you're hungry, if it is the Sabbath day, and Jesus says to them, have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and a need of food, and he says he entered the house of God, he entered the tabernacle and he ate the bread of the presents.

What was the bread of the presence? The bread of the S were 12 loaves of bread, which were put on the altar, 12 loaves of bread representing each of the tribes, and, and it was there. And after the Sabbath, those new loaves of bread were consumed by whom? Well by the Sadian oligarchy families. The, the priestly families ate that bread and, and David, the king, used his authority on, his authority went in there when his folks, his soldiers were hungry and they consumed that bread.

Jesus reminds them of [00:28:00] that and he gave it to his companions. And then Jesus says this remarkable thing, guys, get this right. These rules that you have, that are, that you're, that you're confusing, uh, uh, are, are leading you to things that, that actually oppose the work of God. The Sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind, for the Sabbath.

And then he says something quite interesting, naming himself, the son of man, the human one. As Lord, even of the Sabbath is the one who has the authority to adjudicate whether is appropriate to pluck corn from the field even on the Sabbath when you're hungry. And he says that was sort of the point all along of God's instruction.

This all leads me to remember stories, uh, in our own lifetimes that, uh, where we have had needed to hear this word from Jesus as we've focused so much on the law and on order that we [00:29:00] forgot about the, what God intended those corn fields for in the first place. The picture that I've, I've got up there now you probably don't recognize, but he's one of the former presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church.

This is CC Jones Carpenter, and you may know him. He was the presiding bishop, uh, I think in the 1950s. He was the senior bishop of the Episcopal church during the Civil Rights Movement down in Alabama. And I mention it because, uh, during the, uh, the struggles in Alabama led by Martin Luther King and the, and the students for non the student non-Violence Coordinating committee, uh, in, you know, they, you know, Mar Martin Luther King did a, a, an assault, if you will, a, a project in which they had tried to engage the segregation laws of.

Um, of Birmingham, uh, and, uh, and that involved these adults, uh, marching in, in protest, getting arrested and feel filling the jails of Birmingham in order [00:30:00] to, to make visible the evil of segregation. And, and Bishop Carpenter was someone who was very sympathetic with the drive, uh, for, uh, greater.

Participation in the abundance of our land by, for folks of all race. He supported in principle the idea of, of undoing segregation, but he felt like the Pharisees that, uh, you do this in a particular way, you have to follow laws. And so this notion of, of of. Of breaking laws, uh, in order to expose their unjust nature, their, their unjust nature, uh, was for him, uh, uh, something that Christians should engage in.

And so he was the one who wrote a letter or actually organized, uh, the creation of a letter signed by all of the white, uh, liberal white clergy in Birmingham [00:31:00] criticizing. Martin Luther King when he was arrested in Birmingham, in jailed, and that's what caused not any sort of brutality, not anything done by Bull Connor and the like, but, but this letter by Bishop Carpenter that caused Martin Luther King to write, uh, from prison, uh, what many of us will remember as the his letter from the Birmingham Jail.

Interesting. Is it not that we, the Episcopal Church have a, uh, unfortunate, uh, role that we played in that story. Uh, and Martin Luther King, uh, then wrote this incredible 20 page letter that I, I hope that you'll read. If you've not read it before, it's a good time to reread it 'cause it speaks to our generation today.

Um, but what arose from this, the, the Birmingham movement was failing and, you know, uh, at the time. Uh, but, but, but what arose during that time? You may remember it was something called the Children's Miracle, the Children's March, in which small young children. [00:32:00] Decided that they would, uh, they would march because it was illegal.

The, the, you know, the what, what Bishop Carpenter supported was the federal judge's injunction, which said that, uh, that anyone could be arrested, who even dared to march, uh, any of these adults. And so the adults knew they would be thrown in jail, uh, without any hope of bail. Um. If, if they marched instead, the children began to march, and so they left the Baptist church where they all gathered 20 by 20, and they started marching to the inner city and there happened something simply horrific, uh, the, the police.

Uh, attacked the children. You see here a picture of, of these young school children in their school, school uniforms being put into paddy wagons. You see the firemen, the ones that we honor today, the firemen turning their, these fire hoses, which are designed to be able to spray at a hundred, a hundred feet [00:33:00] and, and not.

Bricks out of a wall being sprayed on these young children. These children that were, some of 'em were sick, some of 'em were, you know, in high school and they had the entire spectrum of age. You see them doing them, suffering the pain of being, you know, sprayed. And then, then they let the German Shepherd dogs, the police dogs, the Canine Corps, nine Canine Corps dogs released on these young children.

In a very famous picture of course, that then brought about, um, the, uh. The shock of the nation that then gave, uh, the movement, um, momentum that it needed, but. Isn't it interesting that it was our own presiding bishop who wrote the letter condemning what Martin Luther King was doing and a reflection on it.

His son, Douglas Carpenter, reflected on the actions of his father, and he said it was the argument it. That was consistent with many people in his time. You know, resisting not integration and not resisting civil rights, but, [00:34:00] but resisting instead, public demonstrations that were necessary to achieve those rights.

He, my father was unable to realize the need to be on the visible front lines for change, and in the end it was his gradualist approach, however positive his view was. However much he differentiated with the, the, the racial majority, uh, but it was his gradualist philosophy that put him on the wrong side of history, put him on the wrong side of the question of race.

His, his willing to wait and say, wait and, and just wait for the law to change, but wait for the majority to change the law that affected the minority that put him on the negative side of civil rights history folks. This is not a new story. It's not an old story. We see it was a story of, of the Pharisees of Jesus' time.

We see it was a story of Martin Luther King's time. Uh, and it's a story of our time as we see these horrific stories, uh, [00:35:00] of, of children. Looking for freedom, looking for opportunity. These, these families, uh, of immigrants coming to our lands as Americans of people have always come to America, uh, in search of freedom and opportunity in food, the, uh, to, to, to participate in the abundance.

That is God's promise. And, and we see them, uh, not, uh, gathering in the, you know, in the city of New York and, and, and, and figuring, you know, being open. Opportunity being open to them to find their way, but rather see them being held in camps and, and, uh, and we see this, this impulse, this reaction that, that is, that focuses on the law and focuses on words like whether or not in arguing about whether or not they are undocumented or illegal.

And we see this, this, uh, strong reaction that says, you know, we need to enforce the law. The law is what's important and not our bread sharing is effectively what we are saying today. So many of [00:36:00] us, I just bring this up because I wanna bring up Jesus's question. Who are the righteous, are the righteous, those of us who are insisting on the legal process for providing f food and comfort and, and shelter to these masses that don't have those things in their homelands or are the righteous, those who are coming to the place of promise, seeking their place, expecting us to welcome them, uh, with Shalom in the way that Jesus taught, who are the sinners among us?

Just a reminder that now, uh, Jesus has taught us that, uh, uh, that through his presence, the, the righteous requirements, whatever the legal requirements are, God has met them for us, uh, in his person, his presence among us, so that it's not for us to look to, uh, others, uh, to be perfect in, in, in their adherence to the law.

But it is up, it is to us to look to Jesus' way [00:37:00] of welcoming all. To his table and that is the means through which God is saving the world. So I pray, Lord, that we will be, I pray to that we, that we will be a people who welcome all and who are able to distinguish between the priority of law and order, and the priority of sharing bread just as Jesus did in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Amen.
