# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 2

[00:00:00] 

Well, good morning folks. Today we are continuing in our, in a new series we started in which we're gonna be doing a close reading of the Gospel of Mark. And, and I wanna remind you of a few things that we talked about last week. First of all, why are we doing this? So it's, it's certainly true that the, uh, the, the, the church throughout the world is reading through the Gospel of Mark.

This year, according to the revised common lectionary, we're gonna be doing it at a, a slower pace and a much more, more deliberative, uh, way of, of working carefully through each of the stories in the gospel. So it'll take us all year to get through it. And, and why are we doing this? Well, it's, it's because, uh, mark, I believe gives us a, a particularly robust, uh, answer to questions that we ourselves are asking in our time as Americans who've gone through quite an incredible struggle in the last year with regard to how we responded to the.

Pandemic, how we've been torn apart in our responses to the pandemic, how we've been torn apart to the events in our, [00:01:00] our international and local political lives, and how we have had that experience of, of of, of often feeling a bit like Elijah. Uh, how could others follow, uh. Uh, other, uh, you know, these other ways.

How, how, how, how, why do I feel so alone? Why do I feel so isolated when I listen to the beliefs of my fellow Americans who are, who are calling us to go down different paths? And, and that was the, as we talked about last week, the, uh, very common experience of the people of Palestine. So, uh, uh, mark then wrote this gospel as we discussed last week in the midst of great trivial, both in Rome, the Roman Empire, and for the people of Palestine.

And I wanna remind you, last week we talked about the prologue of the gospel of Mark. The prologue is the first, uh, you know, 13 to 15 verses depending upon how you, how you cut it. And, uh, and we talked last week about the troubles that [00:02:00] were experienced by the, by the, the Christian Jews in Rome and throughout the Roman Empire.

How, uh. Just throughout the empire, there had been a tremendous instability leading up to, uh, the years 66 to 70 during, which got, you know, we believed Mark wrote his gospel. Uh, there, there was a foreign war where the partan attacked. If you'll recall, there were rebellions on the Eastern flank and in the western flank of the Roman Empire.

Uh, they had the great fire of Rome, which then led to. Blaming the, the Christian Jews on, uh, the blaming the fire on the Christian Jews and, uh, a great persecution pilgrims, if you will, against the Christian Jews, particularly in Rome, but not only in Rome. Uh, and then we saw coup against Nero, um, by those who felt he had fiddled while Rome burned, uh, to, to use the famous phrase.

And then, and then, and then we experienced, or the people experienced, um, uh, in, you know, tremendous political instability. You know, one [00:03:00] single year in which there, there were four emperors, uh, leading up to the one who provided stability, the general who had been leading the, uh, assault on, uh, Judah, uh, in, in response to the Jewish war, uh, who left the battlefield and went and declared him, you know, became emperor, and then was able to, uh, establish a new dynasty.

So there was tremendous political instability. And so that was part of the context. Just as we experienced instability recently, we can have a sense of, of. Of, of just the whiplash that the, that the, that all the citizenry, but particularly the Christian Jews would've felt, and, and then. We talked about Palestine, how there'd been, uh, not just a decade, but many decades of unrest, particularly in the northern port, part of, of Palestine.

The parts that, uh, we call Galilee and Samaria, uh, who were very resistant to Rome. Uh, they were the ones who lived closest to, uh, the, the. Uh, the, [00:04:00] the Roman highways, or rather the highways that, that, uh, that, that were the, the major trade routes and, and the Roman convoys would pass right through their lands.

And so they were, uh, you know, historically, uh, very resistant to the, to the Roman occupation. Uh, but they in particular resistant as, as did the Jews in Judah, the, the demands by Nero, the renewed demands by Nero, that they participate in the imperial cult in which they declared him God and, uh, and worshiped him in, in the efforts, if you recall, of, of imposing that in the temple.

Um, they were, uh, a, a hotbed of what became by the, by the time the decade we're talking about zealotry, uh, a political movement, a militant form of, of, uh, of folks where, where they, they insisted upon. Uh, res a response to Rome that was a tick up of arms. And they're the ones who, uh, who led the, led the revolt, uh, against Rome.

And so there was this war [00:05:00] with Rome. And then, and if we call, we talked about how the Jewish people themselves split into, uh, many factions, you know, four dominant factions, uh, almost like four warlord. And the, and the Christian Jews, uh, there in Palestine found themselves, uh, pariahs, uh, being called to be, to, to prove their patriotism by joining in the war.

Um, and then we talked it about how the prologue, uh, was this extraordinary thing that, that, but, uh, of Mark's gospel, where he imitated the, the announcement of the visitation by an emperor. The language used, used the same language, and he announced the visitation of, of. The Messiah, the anointed one, uh, the good news.

And so there was this new king that he announced to was who was, who was about to do a visitation. He, he announced metaphorically. And so that was the beginning of his, of his gospel. And we talked about how the, in the first scenes that, uh, [00:06:00] this, uh, we see John the Baptist arising, dressed like Elijah in doing things symbolically that evoked the return of Elijah.

And of course, the return of Elijah meant that the day of the Lord had finally come the day in which all, uh, things would be righted, when, which God would turn the world upside down and, uh, and, and, and conquer evil and throw off the oppressors. And, and then we spoke about how the day of the Lord. Uh, uh, signified, uh, uh, that there would be a judgment, a great judgment.

And so John the Baptizer was baptizing people in the Jordan River, uh, preparing them for the judgment, which was to come, uh, and, and which would be, uh. Uh, carried out by the one who would follow him, the one whom he was, who was not even fit to serve. Uh, and I, and, and so this, this notion of, of judgment proceeding deliverance was very important.

So then the next thing we saw was that Jesus, [00:07:00] uh, came before John was anointed by him. And the way that kings were always anointed, he was baptized, uh, to prepare him for the judgment. He received the gift of the Holy Spirit, the per persistent gift of the Holy Spirit. And then we saw at the end of it, of, of the prologue, Jesus inaugurates his kingdom saying the words, uh, that, uh, that, you know, that, that John had said, but announcing the kingdom is here.

And one point that I made is that all of this happened off stage. This all happened in the wilderness. Uh, and so in John's prologue, it's sort of like in a movie, it moves very fast. What we see, I. Is one of those things where you see a prologue of a movie where there's some sort of, uh, action that happened that, uh, was completely, uh, in a different location than the rest of the story that happens in, uh, in the movie that we're about to see in the story.

We're about to, to, uh, over here, and that's what happens here in the gospel of Mark. Mark has [00:08:00] introduced Jesus. Jesus comes on stage, the prologue is over, and the next thing we see. The camera has shifted and it pans over the sea of Galilee, and there is Jesus going about his kingdom. So before we get into that wonderful story today, I wanted to just go over a few things to, that we didn't talk about last week, uh, to help us understand some things, uh, that, that are, that are gonna be important as we carry forward in the Gospel of Mark.

One of the things we need to be careful about being children of the Enlightenment is not to impose our own way of seeing the world. Uh, not all of us see, uh, the world in, in, in individual completely individualistic terms, but in classic liberalism, uh, we have tended towards that. And in fact, I would claim that we here in the United States are polarized, um, by groups of people who, who, some of whom have stronger than.

Uh, others, uh, communitarian value which, which, which, which, which celebrates our [00:09:00] individualism, but also holds on to a sense of, of, of being one family in a and, and who understands our, uh, freedom in terms of, of communitarian values. We are free to be a part of this family and are, we've been liberated in order to be better participants in that family, which is a very different thing than understanding freedom as some individualized, privatized space, uh, that is absolutely sacrosanct and a gift that no one must violate, which is another form.

And so I think we, we, we have this understanding, this way of seeing the world that, that comes from the enlightenment. And I wanted to just stress that was not at all the way the world was in Palestine. In fact, the, the, the way that, uh, scholars would describe it is they have a diadic view, uh, uh, dadism.

And, and that's one in which you see yourself in relation to all others in a hierarchy of values. Uh, you see. Yourself always is interrelated to other people and, uh, the, and, and, and you're, [00:10:00] you're relate to them as though these are people like me, and these are people who are above me or below me. And so it's a very strong, powerful, uh, worldview in which you understand your place.

Now, I would argue that here in our times we are plagued by people who, uh, who, who also see the world with such a view, uh, who some of who've been oppressed for many years, who see that view in many, in, in many who have been at the top of a, of a hierarchy that they perceive to be real, uh, who, who see others below them.

And that'll be important to our story today. So the other part of this is, uh, of, of, of our context that's been important to understand is just how, how close, uh, the Palestine was in this time to the agricultural revolution that transformed hu homo sapiens from hunter gatherers into farmers. And, uh, what very quickly happened was, uh, the, as the, [00:11:00] the, as we, as we were, we stopped wandering and, and, and, and hunting.

Our food and started domesticating ourselves and domesticating animals and plants. We then started experiencing the threats from that and the loss of food. And so an elite, uh, quickly arose throughout the world whenever this happened. And so in Palestine, that was true as well. And the elite, uh, would extract any surplus gains from our production of food, uh, in exchange for protection and, uh, in, in protecting us against all evils, particularly in the form of other bands of homo sapiens.

And, uh, and, uh, in exchange for that, they would, uh, demand tribute. And so. We know that Rome and, uh, the Jewish elites demanded tribute from the peasantry, and they also created bureaucracies that controlled our exchange of goods. They, uh, so to, so to speak, imposed tariffs and such. And what that did to those, uh, those who were [00:12:00] the actual farmers who worked the land from morning to to night, was it, was it, uh, it it reduced them to subsistence life because the surplus, anything that was surplus and it mounted about 40% of their, uh, of, of the, their production of, of grains and other foods, uh, was, was taken by the elites in, in exchange.

And so, uh, this subsistence life was a fact of life. Now, one of the problems that they had in Palestine is that, and this wasn't just in Palestine, but, but throughout wherever, there were these temples to the Imperial cult, those temples, um. Became part of the redistribution system. They stockpiled that surplus, uh, whether it be in the form of cattle and sheep or grains, and then they redistributed it to the bureaucracy that ran the temple.

And, and, uh, in, in, into, into the artists in class who, uh, who. Uh, you know, provided many of the intermediate goods between the [00:13:00] peasants and the elites and, uh, and and more importantly, the temple controlled access to God. And this is in a huge part of the story that Mark is going to be seeing. 'cause you're gonna, we're gonna be seeing, Jesus is going to attack this part of the social order when we see him attacking the, the, the, uh, the Jews who run the temple and attacking the, the Pharisees who, who in, who, who were a good group of people, the, the group that Jesus had most in common with.

But he would critique their emphasis on purity because they themselves, as he would, as we're gonna see, were part of the problem. Uh, that because they would name many of the, the peasants, uh, as unworthy of worship, unworthy of inclusion in God's love because they were unclean. And you will see again and again in the story that's about to unfold Jesus attacking that.

Another part of our story that's real important as a result of this is that this subsistence life led many folks to, uh, to the. To, to fall into the life of a day laborer. A day laborer had a lifespan of about six to seven [00:14:00] years, once they became a day laborer. But, but they became those individuals who would sit out there, uh, waiting for, uh, someone to, you know, a, a a supervisor to drive up in his truck and say, y'all pile in.

I got some work for you. And, uh, it was a very, very difficult life. And we're gonna see a lot of stories where Jesus will be sympathetic with that group. It reduced many to tenant farming where the, the, the Lordly class, the priestly class who ran the temple, and the, and the Hellenistic, uh, Jews who, who, uh, collaborated with Rome, uh, you know, became the owners of the land that they were on because they had been, become bankrupt.

And so, um. What we saw then also is land being taken, uh, from the peasants and then used by the elite, uh, to build, uh, uh, distribution centers. And so right by Jesus' home, there was a town that is never mentioned in the Bible that was, you know, just a few, uh, miles walked from his home at Nazareth [00:15:00] SRIs, which was built, uh, right before he was born and was a major tax collection center, uh, where, you know, housed with the, the, the, the people who collaborated with Rome.

And he's gonna be criticizing them an awful lot today as we'll see. And then one other thing that's part of our story today is tax forming. Uh, it was illegal by, by the time of Jesus to, uh, by the, the Romans made it illegal to, to farm out tax collection of their tribute, but they left. Uh, left in place the, uh, tax forming of other forms of local taxes that King Herod, uh, anti pa, uh, prince Harpa or others would've, who would've, uh, assigned.

And, and so, you know, tolls, for example, between the provinces and those types of things, uh, those could be tax form. The way tax forming worked was you'd have one of your own people who would say, I'm tired of working the land. I'm gonna go rise up and I'm going to go lease the rights to collect money from my [00:16:00] own people.

And, uh, and I will then, uh, collect, uh, taxes and then turn them over and I'll make a profit. I'll be able to take a cut out of all the money that I, so when I walk on your land, or if I stop you, you know, I'm gonna get a cut of every dollar I extract from you. And so these people were parasites and seen as such, uh, and that's important to our story today.

Another thing that I think is relevant to us is that, uh, in this period, uh, there was a, you know, the peasantry was the mass of the people. You know, more than 90% of the people were the peasants. Jesus wasn't one of them. Jesus was a tekton, which was, we've talked about over the Christmas, uh, period, the advent period was a, a very sophisticated combination of what we would call a mason and a, and a carpenter today, a, a really highly literate, highly technical, uh, skillset.

Uh, so he would've been a, an artisan and, uh, and, and, uh, and the elite, uh, were not here in the United States, we talk about the 1%. Well, they were less than a half percent of the [00:17:00] people. Very small group of people. All of this led to a really interesting situation. Our story takes place entirely today in, in gile.

And so I appreciated, uh, this, uh, observation that the, that that Galilean peasant found himself, seeing the Temple Elite in particular, and also those sanctioned by Rome to be their heads, her tpa. Uh, as, as those you know, they're the ones that they were supposed to follow. They're the, they're the leaders that they're supposed to be able to entru, entru, uh, trust and, and look to, as an example, those who, uh, they're supposed to be able to rely on in terms of protecting their faith.

And those folks themselves turn out to be their oppressors. So that's the setting of our story of, of the gospel of Mark. We'll, we'll say more each each week. But, uh, that's, those things are particularly important today for what happens as we saw after Jesus has, has been baptized and tempted in the [00:18:00] wilderness.

He emerges and immediately begins proclaiming the gospel, uh, announcing, uh, that God has arrived, announcing that God is visiting God's people. The good news of that and saying the time is now that that time that you've been waiting for has arrived, so it's now time to repent, to turn around from whatever ways that you have been going, that are not the ways that God taught us.

To trust in the good news that God is doing something new. So we saw that last week. It's also the beginning of our lesson this week. So I wanna point out, as we look at our story, we've, we've, John Mark has really set up this incredible, uh, vision. You know, uh, there is this, there's this trouble in Palestine, there's this trouble throughout the Roman Empire, but a new king is born.

A new king is gonna come, and a new king is gonna come and do that, which is to happen on the day of the Lord, which is, uh, which, which is the world getting turned upside down. And so what does Jesus do? Well, we ought [00:19:00] to pay attention to what Mark doesn't say. You know, he didn't go and, and, and organize an army or a militia.

As I say here, he didn't, he didn't summon the oath keepers or the proud boys, and he didn't go and, and provoke or, or call into being his own band of, of militants who were going to attack the Roman convoys as they, as they went down the trade, uh, the, uh, the trade routes or, or, or attack the temple and, uh, and have an assault on which they were going to take over the management and to appoint themselves as the, as a new temple elite.

No, it didn't do any of those things. It's rather stunning. Instead, Jesus went not to peasants and not to the elite, but to folks of his own class, his own artists in class. And what did he do? He didn't equip them with pitchforks and, uh. Uh, you know, battering rams or, or clubs. Instead, he called them [00:20:00] to be a part of a very unique fellowship, and that's the story that we're going to be seeing in the coming weeks.

And so we see Jesus is walking along the Galilee and he, and first we, we see, we see two stories that are almost identical in, in their form. First he sees, uh, Simon, he'll be called Simon throughout our story until suddenly he becomes the rock upon which Jesus is going to build. And that he's renamed by Jesus as the one we, uh, know him, uh, to be Peter.

But throughout, uh, the beginning of our, our story, he'll be called Simon by Mark and his brother Andrew. And they were fishing and they were throwing fish in nets into the sea. I want you to pay attention to that. So they, these were artisans. They were, they were people who dealt with cash. They caught fish and they converted it to cash quickly.

And so they were the targets of the tax farmers because they were, were very ready source of currency. Um. And, uh, they were, they were of the kind, they were not really evidently one, we, we can infer that they weren't [00:21:00] wealthy fishermen because they were, they didn't have a boat. They were out there, uh, throwing these weighted na nets that I'm gonna show you out into the sea.

You could wade out with these nets and, and they still do, just wade out into the surf and catch the, uh, the, uh, tilapia and the sardines that are native to the Sea of Galilee. Uh, and so Jesus says, come follow me and I will show you how to fish for people. Let's focus on that word. That's an important thing.

And what did they do? They left and they followed him. And then we see that he, he then later Jesus is, is continuing on, uh, around Capernaum. And, uh, he see, he encounters James and John. Now, these two were fishermen. They were the sons of Zebedee and they had a boat. And, uh, and they also, we'll, we'll see, had a, an employee.

So they were probably wealthy fishermen. They have at least one boat. And, uh, he called them and again, they followed him, uh, and leaving their dad [00:22:00] with their, with dad's employees just sort of sitting there. Uh, and then, and then, uh, and then I've jumped ahead in our gospel 'cause it's marque something else in his story that comes up.

And then he comes this little passage here where Jesus went out, uh, by the lake again, by the water, by the, the, the, the scene of, of, you know, the waters of the place where there is chaos that's been put into order. And Jesus is gonna put this lake into order, uh, you know, later on with one of these stories.

And he goes once again there. And, uh, and he meets Levi Levi's, one of those tax farmers, and he's, uh, in his toll booth, if you will, uh, collecting taxes. And Jesus says, follow me. And what did Jesus do? He up and followed him. Let's, let's drill down a little bit and understand this story a little better. I wanna make sure this is gonna be the, the scene of so much of Mark's gospel.

I wanted to give you a visual and understand some of the geographic context of Galilee. Here's a fishing boat, a contemporary fishing boat on the Sea of [00:23:00] Galilee. And you can see those cliffs that are alongside it. Uh, the map here, you can see it's real close to Nazareth. Almost none of our story is gonna occur in Nazareth.

It's almost all going to occur. The first half of Mark's gospel is gonna occur along this, these, these towns that were along the Sea of Galilee. Um, and so, uh, this story is taking place in the northern part, which is Cape Capernaum. Now the Sea of Galilee, uh, is at the, uh, at the beginning of the Jordan River and the Jordan River flows, uh, past Jerusalem, all the way down to the Dead Sea.

Um, uh. And this is what it looks like. I wanted to make sure you see these hills. You're familiar with the Golden Heights from our current events. The Golden Heights are important to our story today. They were sort of like Iowa in the sense of, uh, their fertility, uh, and, and the crops. They were a just massive, uh, the golden, golden golden heights in that time.

And today are, you know, uh, a place where there's tremendous wheat production. Uh, [00:24:00] but the important point of the, the, the Golden Heights, and there's another set of hills, the name of which I forget, uh, are they flank, the, the Sea of Galilee, the lake, and, uh, and, and that, and that, that flanking, uh, those hills then pro produce a channeling effect of the winds.

And so the Sea of Galilee is extraordinarily windy, which will become an important part of the stories that Mark is gonna tell downstream. So I wanted to. To point that out. It's a beautiful area. Uh, and, and, and the fishing trade was big. As I said, they t fished for tilapia and sardines and, and a few other, uh, kinds of native fish.

Uh, you can see a typical Galilean fishing boat there. And, and, and the nets, uh, that they, they would throw the nets out into the water. Those, these were weighted nets and basically the, you throw the net out and it would spread out, and then the weights as they would sink, would collapse the net, and then they would pull the, the net back in.

So you could do this, uh, without a boat. If, you know, sort of, sort of like getting a food truck before you get your restaurant. You could just get the net first, [00:25:00] take care of the net, and just wait out there and do this. And when you were ready for your restaurant, if you will, uh, to follow by metaphor, then you could, you'd have, you could afford a boat.

And, uh, the sons of Zebedee, uh, you know, the Zebo family had multiple boats and multiple employees as far as we understand, and they would just go out deeper and have more nets. Uh, but the same kind of thing. So Jesus says, come follow me, and I'm gonna make you fishers of humans. And one of the things that I've heard folks talk about is, oh, that means that, uh, we're gonna go save people.

Uh, but let's talk about what did that mean? What does it mean to be a fisher of human from a biblical sense? Pretty important question if we're to understand the point that Mark is making. And, uh, and what I wanna understand, make sure you understand that throughout his gospel, mark is gonna be quoting the Old Testament, the Hebrew scriptures, the scriptures as they were for Jesus.

And, and the, the, the early, uh, Christian Jews, um, they, uh, they would reference scripture. And so the, the [00:26:00] phrase fisher of humans comes from their scriptures. It had a particular meaning. It may not be the meaning that you would think. Uh, so the first one, the first place that I would point to is from the prophet Jeremiah.

Um, you know. Jeremiah is, is, is uh, talking about a time when, when the, the Jewish diaspora, when God has dispersed the Jews through the conquering, they're conquering by the Assyrians and then later by the Babylonians. And he's, and he's talking about a time that will come someday when God would deliver, uh, God's people back to their homeland, but only after having judged them.

And so, you know, you guys talk now about, uh, me being the one who, who, who brought you up out of Egypt. And that's what the story you tell when you do your Seders. But someday you're gonna change that story. 'cause what you're really gonna remember is how I brought you up out of the land of the North and all the lands from which I had, where I had, uh, from, which I had banished [00:27:00] you, uh, and, and I, and to which I had banished you.

And, um. And I'll bring you back to this land that I gave to your ancestors, but that's not gonna be fun because when, when, when I do that, um, uh, he, he, he said, um. I'm going to send hordes of fishermen to, to catch all of those, to catch all those folks who have been preying upon my people. I'm gonna hunt them down.

I've been watching all their, their, all their moves. I see the sin. I see how, uh, they have corrupted my land with their idolatry and how they filled the land. That was their promised land with detestable practices. So there will be judgment. There will be an accounting Jeremiah says, when I deliver you.

And then, uh, fishers have been also as phrase that prophet aim is used. He said here, this you cows of Beon who are on Mount Samaria, who cheat the [00:28:00] weak, who crush the needy, who say to their husbands, bring drinks so we can get drunk. Uh, the cows of Beon, uh, beon, uh, is, is the golden heights. Uh, that lucrative area.

And who would he, who would've Amos been talking about in his time while he would've been talking about the kings that had set themselves up to be fat, drunk and happy, and who lorded over the peasantry in Amos's time. That's who he was talking about. And so he, uh, and so Amos talks about fishermen who will, um, who will bring back the days of holiness.

The new day. This is the day of the Lord will come. And when the day of the Lord comes, Amos said they will take you away with hooks, even the last one of you with fish hooks. And so a fisher of men, uh, is gonna be fishing for these people who have, uh, oppressed the poor. You'll go out through each wall, each one of you, and you'll be flung into Harmon.

So, um, [00:29:00] there, it looks like a, um. Skipped Ezekiel. Uh, but, uh, the, the, uh, well, I have a note here about it. So, so what is fissures of men? What is fishers of humans in scripture? Well, the first thing to remember is that it's, it's something in every case. It's associated with the day of the Lord. It's associated with this judgment that is to come.

It's a judgment that is this first step in the deliverance of God's people. Uh, and it's a, it's a judgment that happens to God's people, uh, those who are being delivered or being judged as part of is the first step in being delivered. And in the, in the, in the prophet Jeremiah's case, fishers of men are those who are gonna deliver us from the idolatry and the detestable practices of the, of, of those who have worshiped other gods.

Uh, and, and in the prophet Ezekiel, uh, the Ezekiel, uh, text, uh, is, is one in which, um. He [00:30:00] talks about Pharaoh and he, and he's going to, uh, pharaoh, in, in his, in, in the Ezekiel's example, is a crocodile. And there's all sorts of fish that attach to this crocodile. And the Lord of the day of the Lord is gonna, is going to hook the crocodile, pull it out of the Nile, and throw it onto the land.

And along with it'll be all the parasites who, who have been subsisting on the work of the crocodile. And so he, again, uh, Ezekiel is talking about those who have a parasitic form of life feasting upon those who have appointed themselves king, who are false kings. And then of course, the prophet Amos we just talked about, uh, who, uh, you know, the, the fish fishers of men are those who are gonna deliver us from those who have crushed the peasantry.

Who have subsisted in this, this life based upon a value of human hierarchy and who can't even be bothered to have a conversation about change, about transformation, about [00:31:00] social justice, uh, for those who are beneath their station. And so here's the, the, the, the language from Ezekiel. I'm against you. Uh, the Nile is all mine.

I made it for myself. And so I'm gonna set hooks in your jaws and I'll make the fish from the Niles Canal. The Nile's canals cling to your scales. I'll, I'll drag you out and throw you up on the side. And also, all those fish from the Niles can canals, you'll fall on the open ground. So if you can imagine Ezekiel's talking about fish, just flopping on the ground, drying out, withering in the sun.

Um, so that's what a fissure of humans is in, in biblical I. Uh, form. So when Jesus evokes it, he's, he's invoking some prophetic imagery, which would've been well known to his artisan class folks. So that's fishers of men. Now, he also, later on in the gospel in chapter two, we see him walking along and he is, again, by the [00:32:00] lake.

And now he encounters Levi. And Levi, as I said, is collecting taxes. And he says, follow me. And Levi got up and followed me. And the point I just wanna make there is that not only did he go to his artisan class to, to form his fellowship, he also went to those who, who, uh, who, who were supposed to be horizontally related to him, but had chosen to be collaborators with the enemy, if you, so, if you, so to speak, with, with the oppressors.

And so what did he do to Levi? Well, he called him to quit his job. He called him to say, stop being a part of the, of the process of exploiting your people. Stop profiting from this. Stop being a parasite. Come and join me in a new way of living. And Matthew and Levi did later on in other gospels. He's called Matthew, but in, in, in March Gospel.

He's, he's, he's Levi. So I wanted to just point out that's what it means. That's what this call means. And it's a call, if you will, to revolution to, to a [00:33:00] disruptive practice. It's going to take on, uh, those who have, who have perpetuated injustice. And how do they respond? Well, we see, uh, in, in with all the prophets, a paradigm, a paradigmatic, uh, response.

Uh, and, and, and that's classically in that story of Elijah that Tom read so well to us. The story, when. Elijah, uh, recruited Elisha or Elisha. Uh, and, and if you remember, uh, he, he just, he comes to him, he's plowing in the fields, and Elisha had, uh, had a long group of, of, of oxen there. And Elijah comes up to him in the middle of his fields and just threw his coat on him.

And Elisha immediately followed him, dropped what he was doing. He said, okay, let me, let me, let me go celebrate what's happening with my family and then I will follow you. And he did. And so that's what we see. Uh, also this is, is what is, you know, we know what Jesus is called is, it's this call to become a part of what God is doing.

And the [00:34:00] paradigmatic response that we see from all three of these stories is the same. They left their nets and they followed him. They followed him. They left their father and his employees in the boat. Levi quit his job and followed him.

That's a pretty important point. And later on, mark is going to have remind us of just how hard it is to, to follow Jesus now that this is the first call, and this is what we call the Call of the Disciples. Uh, but I, but one of the things that Mark is gonna show us is that he's going to have to call us again and again, you know, Peter, excuse me.

Uh, the sons of Zedi didn't leave their jobs. They didn't leave their fishing boats. They didn't, and, and neither, neither did Simon or Andrew leave all of their possessions. That's a misnomer. Later on in the gospel, we're gonna see, we're gonna see, uh, Jesus returning to the homes [00:35:00] of, of those folks. They followed him, but they didn't relinquish their, their, you know, everything that was in their life and begin following him and leave it all behind.

They, they instead, they, they redeployed the resources that had been, uh, focused on one way of life. And then they, and they re re, um, uh. Reallocated them to this effort of following Jesus. So they became a, a hosting place. For example, Simon's Home becomes a, a place where Jesus, uh, was hosted and they, they did many of their meetings.

And we'll see that. That's, uh, that's, that's how that came about. But Jesus is gonna talk about how hard it is to have this peg matic response. Uh, later on in chapter 10 of his gospel, he, he'll remind us, he'll give us that famous phrase about how hard it is for a rich man to be, uh, you know, to, to, to enter into this, this world in which I.

Uh, God reigns in our lives because, uh, uh, there is, there's [00:36:00] so much, uh, to relinquish and it's easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom. In other words, mark understands Jesus understood how hard it is to make this complete commitment. To this new way of being, and that's one of the things we're going to see.

So what we see today is the first step of Jesus inaugurating his kingdom. And it's not by calling an army, it's not called by calling us to, to militancy at all. Rather it's called, it's, it's a call for us to, uh, get rid of this dichotomous world in which we see a private life of our own that is distinct from our participation in our society.

Uh, from the, from the, from the discussion, from the discourse about how we're going to order our society. This dichotomy between our personal life and politics. Jesus is going to, to, uh, come out and call us [00:37:00] to, and he's gonna insist that those must be one. And he's going to call us to disrupt the social order that in which we are embedded, um, by accepting our own moral responsibility, our social and economic responsibility for its disorder.

Within our own communities. And another point that I'd make, because Christians have been confused about this, and many in our own time are confused by this, Jesus is not calling us to leave the world in which we live. He's not calling us out of the world. He's not telling us to be secretarian to form some community that stays away.

So it's not so that, so like the Essenes, uh, it uh, it doesn't become corrupted by all those other people? No. It's an understanding that all of us are tainted by, uh, by this, by this disorder of the, of God's world, uh, that, that of the Promised land. And, and we're all called to be a part of its, uh, reordering [00:38:00] into the kingdom of God.

But the way we do that is not through militancy. It's not by, uh, taking up arms. It's not by assaulting the temple, but rather by. Embracing a new and transformative way of being the one that we've been calling the way of love. So that's our story. That's the end of chapter one in Mark's Gospel. And what we see is Jesus has now gathered his band, his fellowship, and he's called them to be disruptive of the order in which they find themselves embedded today.

And to lead by their example, uh, the world into a more right ordering. And that's what we're gonna see in the coming weeks. And in the next few weeks, we'll see Jesus going and attacking each of those areas of oppression and then replacing it with new ways of being in each one of them. And so I would just say to us, folks, this is, this is our [00:39:00] calling too.

And I'd remind us, uh, that it's a calling that the disciples themselves, uh, said yes to. And yet, uh, we will see that they were rather clumsy in responding that again and again. Jesus had to call them back to this process. So that's probably true about ourselves. So, uh, I would urge us to be forgiving of ourselves and that today we simply agree to recommit ourselves to this call to be Jesus's disciples in the way we have seen today.

May it be so, may be so in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen.
