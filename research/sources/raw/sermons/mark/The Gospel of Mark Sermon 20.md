# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 20

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Uh, today we, uh, actually the, the prayer we had, uh, began with a, a reflection on the Gospel of John and the story of the wilderness feedings. We are at a similar place, uh, in our study of the Gospel of Mark. We've been working, uh. Uh, doing a close reading through the Gospel of Mark, uh, these last several weeks.

And we continuing to do that and we find ourselves in chapter seven of the Gospel of Mark, uh, which, uh, is just after the, that, that one of those wilderness feedings that, uh, that mark records. Whether the loaves and fish are turned into an abundance for all who were present. Um, today we have a story that, like our last one, uh, from last week, is sandwiched between Jesus'.

Uh. Prophetic actions, the wilderness feeding, and then, uh, which is, which is something that happened in, in Jewish territory, and a similar [00:01:00] feeding that will happen in Gentile territory. And the next actually story that we're gonna see is, uh, in, in, in reading the book in order. Would be the, the story of, of the Syrophoenician woman, where a gentile woman, Jesus engages with a, a gentile woman and she talks about, uh, the, you know, the how, how the, the Josh God would want her to have at least the crumbs from the table, uh, that Jesus is setting.

So that's where this story, situs and I, I, I, uh, emphasize that simply because our, our, our way of going through the gospel of Mark, as I remind you, is we're trying to look at this grand tapestry that Mark has painted that tells us who this Jesus is and what God's claim upon us is through Jesus and, and who we are, uh, to understand ourselves, to be in light of the, the truth that is revealed in Jesus.

Uh, so, so as, as we dig in that today, I. Bring us back to remember certain things that are pretty important about this. A very familiar story to us. Uh, you know, a couple of the [00:02:00] characters. Uh, one of the things that, uh, mark tells us is that, uh, there, uh, are two groups, uh, that, that once again, uh, as they were in chapter two, now here in chapter seven, are alive against the Jesus movement.

Uh, the first are the. But I wanna mention are the scribes or the legal experts that are, have come up from Jerusalem. You know, these guys have walked, you know, over 90 miles, uh, to see what's going on with this, uh, political uprising that is, is beginning to concern folks, uh, who are in power that's happening up in Galilee.

And the mountain is in fertile regions near the Sea of Galilee. Uh, these, these, uh, legal experts from Jerusalem, of course, represent the elite, those who are empowered to govern, uh, the Jewish. Uh, province of Rome, uh, it is known as Palestine. And so it's a, in a certain sense, they are protecting the Sadducees.

And, uh, in, in the, the set of, of the, the opposing party, the Pharisees, uh, who have some sort of power. And then the other group are the Pharisees, themselves of Galilee. So [00:03:00] geographically they live in Galilee. They would've grown up with, uh, uh, Jesus' peers, uh, and they're members of the Pharisee party. Now, I wanna mention a subset here because scholars, uh.

Recognize certain things that Mark describes as being the characteristics of one subset of the Pharisaic party, and that is called The Hare. The Hare. Uh, and we'll talk about that more. But the, the thing I wanna remind us of that's most important here, um, is that the Pharisees are not, like many of us were taught in Sunday school, we know from scholarship, uh, that, uh, we, we got much of our understanding who the Pharisees are.

When we were kids from anti-Semitic scholarship from Germany that denied the, the Jewish nature of Jesus and, and emphasized the opposition that he had with the Pharisees. But in, in, in studying, you know, the quest for understanding the historical Jesus, one of the things we've learned is that the Pharisees were a good.

[00:04:00] Well-meaning people, they were part themselves of a holiness movement, a massive, powerful holiness movement trying to help Israel become Israel to achieve the, the vision that God had for they were not willfully persecuting people, but rather were striving to construct a holy society that they thought would be pleasing to God.

And I, I mention that, uh, because it's pretty crucial to our story here to see that there is conflict with the, between, between the Pharisees and Jesus. Um, and, uh, I I also wanna mention that our own recipes for our, the communal gumbo that we are striving to create together have a lot more in common at times with the leaven of the Pharisees.

Than they do with the leaven of Herod tpa that we talked about last week. So we talked, if you remember, about the head on a platter from Herod tpa and the leaven of that Herod had wrought. And today we're dealing, this story deals with the leaven that the Pharisees have, have wrought. And [00:05:00] so my opening comment to you is I think that we have an awful lot more.

Common ourselves these days, uh, with the Pharisees. So I think we should pay close attention to that. So what we see is conflict and controversy arise as these two groups try to de-legitimize the Jesus movement that had been arising so far in Galilee, and it ultimately will go to Jerusalem. And Mark then recalls this.

Episode as part of his description in his, in his painting on his canvas, beloved of the Pharisees, that Jesus opposed. So what did the Pharisees do? Well, the Pharisees, uh, had already, we've seen, criticized the Jesus movements, very inclusive eating habits. Uh, once again, we see that happening. We saw it in chapter two and elsewhere, and they.

Those, the eating habits that they prescribed, uh, demanded a maintenance of strict group boundaries. This is something we know is characteristic, particularly of the Hing people. Uh, they felt that in order to be [00:06:00] more holy, we need to have a strict compliance with the, uh, the scriptural and particularly the teaching of the elders.

And, and that that taught us how to. To fulfill God's instruction to fulfill to the oral tradition. Uh, and they, they felt that, uh, holiness was represented by ritual purity. And that's the important word that we see in there in the gospel. And our English translation is ritual cleansing, ritual purity, and, and dietary restrictions come into play here.

Right. So for the Pharisees, we've talked about this before, the. The symbolic purity code is really fundamental to preserving the ethnic and political identity of the Jewish people over and against oppression. So these were good people who were part of a holiness movement and Jesus repudiates there.

Exclusivist definitions of what holiness means, of what living with God means. So that's what we see happening. So [00:07:00] with that big sketch of this story, let's Dr. Dive into the plot. So what we see here is a conflict over what. What Mark describes very clearly as ritual washing. I want to emphasize the word ritual because it's so easy for those of us who have been brought up with, uh, uh, sanitation codes in our own homes and workplaces to read into this and say, oh.

Sound like they were right. They were, they were interested in having clean hands so the germs wouldn't, um, wouldn't, uh, be passed from one to another. And that would be, uh, anachronistic, uh, very for in this, in these, in these days. And in fact, in into very recent times, I. We had no idea of the concept of germs and, and, uh, and the importance of cleanliness throughout most of the world.

Uh, and so, so we were, the conflict was over ritual washing, ritual cleaning, right? So in ch in verse two, we see that they say that they noticed that some of Jesus's disciples were eating [00:08:00] with unclean hands. And then in verse five, they say. Why do your disciples eat their food with unclean hands? So that's the conflict that they, they, they generate and Jesus responds by not, not by challenging their purity code, but something much more, um, powerful.

He, he challenges the entire. Pharisaic oral tradition itself and says, it's not just the conclusions you've reached, but the foundation that underlies it. That is simply wrong. And so in verse 15, he says, it's the things that come out of a person that make a person unclean. It's the substance, not the, not the form.

And Jesus then. After having re reputated that, repudiated that, uh, with, uh, something we'll get into, uh, he then returns back to their question of, of ritual washing by renouncing the kosher regulations of the purity code. This is pretty important. Verse 23 [00:09:00] says, all these things come from with, uh, all these evil things come from within a person.

Make a person unclean. And so, uh, by the way, this I was as an aside, this is where you, we find one of the Christian bases for not following in the gospel. That is, other than Paul's writings where we find, you know, not following the kosher regulations 'cause Jesus himself talked that. So let's get into the details.

Ritual cleansing ritual. Ritual cleaning in preparation for a table comes from actually, uh, Exodus chapter 30, verse 12, and following in another place in that, in, in chapter 40 in Exodus. Uh, and then the Levitical codes that, that, uh, reiterate those things in which it was the, it wasn't all of the Jewish people, but in particular the priests of Aaron.

Before they were to enter into the tabernacle to do the priestly duties who were to do a ritual cleansing. And it was a, and over time through their oral tradition, they developed ways of, of, uh, you know, thinking about that and what that entailed. And, [00:10:00] and so they had layer upon what I would call accretions of layer upon layer upon layer of things that needed to be done in order to be ritually clean, cleansed before you entered into God's presence.

And so there was, uh, it's listed here, uh, you know, washing of hands, a purification of food that's been bought at the Iora, the marketplace. Uh, there was the cleansing of utensils. Now, in reality, those practices, uh, were as, again, these were not, uh, uh, matters of hygiene. These were ritual practices, and they were required only of the sons, of Aaron, only of, uh, the priests.

Uh, and they were kept other than by the priest. They were kept only by. An extremist sect of the Pharisees that were known as the Hare. So there was a, a subset of the Pharisees who ex, who wanted to extend the, the, the, uh, requirements that were imposed by the law upon the priests as they entered into the Holy of Holies, upon all the Jewish people.

And they said, and their, and their holiness movement, their idea was [00:11:00] that all of these types of, of rituals should be done not just by the people who are, who are of the priestly families. By all Jews. And in fact that the fact of oppression by various, uh, con conquering peoples, uh, was due to the fact that not all the people were doing this.

So it was a sort of an early priesthood of a believer type of, of teaching that they had notice that the conflict happens in the marketplace. And so what we see here is Jesus now engaging, he's engaged all sorts of other. Places, the home, the hearth, uh, the synagogue. Now he's, he's engaging, uh, in speaking about the economic sphere, the rista concern of, with this ritual, clean cleansing, was to guard against consuming produce.

So, as I said, this was not about germs, it was about guarding against consuming produce that may. Have been rendered unclean, uh, at some stage of production. So in other words, uh, they did, you know, in other words, uh, the, an [00:12:00] impurity could have been contracted in the production of the food. Really, in either of two ways.

The farmer. Himself could have sown, uh, or harvested, uh, the food in a way that didn't comply with the law. And perhaps, for example, in violation of Sabbath, you don't know if the farmer harvested on Sabbath when no one was looking. Right. Uh. Or it could be that the, the, the produce that you're eating was the first fruits.

You don't know if the farmer sent the first fruits to make money off of it or he sent it to the temple the way he was supposed to. Right. And so to protect against the fact that the fruits may have not gone. Uh, uh, undergone proper separation for the ties, uh, against, you know, for these two reasons. Uh, it was the possibility, a great possibility you might be eating unclean food that you bought in the marketplace, ritually, unclean food, and therefore, before you could consume it, before you could prepare it, any of the tools, any of those things, you need to go through a ritual cleansing, which was a.

[00:13:00] Taking of water in one hand and, and, and washing the other hand in a ritual way, uh, uh, so that, uh, that, that you would be, be made right with God and the food would be right, be made right with God before you ate it. And so they asked Jesus, why are you not doing this? This is what the elders teach us. We are supposed to do, the elders, meaning the Pharisees of the people of the p parties.

Now notice, mark, in the midst of all this. Names. The fact, I think this is sort of a poetic part of it, names the fact that the disciples, when, when all this happens, were eating what? They were eating bread. They just left the wilderness. And so Mark is introducing this theme of bread sharing. And so now he introduce this, uh, introduce this, this theme of conflict over how we share our bread.

And, uh, and what makes it a valid bread sharing? So the faira objection to unwashed hands might have been, and with the way Mark is placing this, uh, a, a, a deeper had had a deeper meaning in, in [00:14:00] the sense that the. The implication being the disciples themselves were contaminated because of their social practice, because they had just been out in the wilderness breaking bread and fish, uh, together with all sorts of people.

You don't know where they came from and you don't know, you can't be assured of the ritual, purity of them. And then shortly before, uh, excuse me, right, right after this, mark's gonna tell the story about Jesus himself, uh, in the Syrophoenician woman in the, in the, in the, in the. Share breaking of bread with the Gentiles in Gentile territory.

Uh, and so in the midst of all of this, this theme of breaking bread, we have this conflict over what makes bread sharing and bread eating ritually clean. And so we hear Jesus saying, Hey, the true sight of purity is not in the hands, it's in the heart. The boundaries of our community. I community identity, our communal identity are not given [00:15:00] in a kosher diet, are not given in the practices that we follow, the rituals, practices, the ritual practices, the religious practices.

That's not what makes us God's people, but rather our way of being, the way we live, the way we love this way of love. And so, Jesus, in this text here establishes a, a rule, a rule. That is the way of, of showing our faithfulness, which is a rule based, not on ritual, but on ethics. And again, then gives a list of things, all of which have to do with people.

The sins that are listed all have to do with people. I. Uh, abusing power, interestingly enough, and elevating themselves and, and suppressing others, uh, objectifying others. And so if you wanna know whether or not you're with the father, with your, whether you're with God, you don't look at whether you're watching your hands.

You look at whether. Your heart reaches out to your neighbor in love. So this sounds like this could be [00:16:00] something that, uh, is a very interesting story. It's good to hear about Jesus has nothing to do with us. Right. Well, I wanna suggest to you that the 11 of the Pharisees is something that we see, uh, still to this day, like, uh.

Like any 11, if you don't throw it out, uh, once a year, if for spring cleaning, it'll just grow and grow and grow and spread and spoil the whole loaf. Uh, and so we see this now, I, there's a, a story that, uh, is perhaps apocryphal that I've been told that I've shared with you once before. Uh, you know, that illustrates how we are, we do this ourselves, just even in our family settings as the story.

I, I mentioned you once before about the, the sisters and brothers who were all gathered for a family meal. Um, and, uh, and, and, and, and this meal was one in which mom was not cooking. She wasn't preparing the food. She wasn't actually around. Uh, and so they're gathering for their first time and they're, they're preparing the, the roast the way mom had always done it.

And then, and they spent a long time. And as they were about to eat it, a conflict arises [00:17:00] among 'em because one of 'em realizes, wait a minute, uh, you, you prepared this roast and you didn't cut the end off, and you have to cut the end off of the roast. Or it's going to spoil and the, and the siblings had all sorts of dispute over, well, what should they do?

Because the, the, the roast had to be done the way mom taught, uh, or else it might taste as good. It won't taste like mom's roast. And that's sort of the whole point, isn't it? For, you know, to, for it to be. We hope it will be. And then, and then eventually they do contact mom and, and say, and, and have her settle the argument.

And then she explains to them, no, the reason I, I always cut the end off the roast is because it wouldn't fit in the pots that I got when I was married. Uh, so it had nothing to do with what you thought it was. And so, uh, yeah, we have these traditions of the elders that we carry on and we carry on until we lose sight of why they are there.

And they then ultimately end up. Distorting our purposes. One of the ones that I, I got that was passed on to me, uh, that I remember as a kid was, don't date [00:18:00] outside your type. So it was very clearly taught to me that I was to, uh, I was not really allowed or welcomed. Uh, you know, a, a girl would not be welcome back to my house if she was not white.

Anglos. Saxon Protestant, uh, very clear boundaries. And that, uh, that's, that's what, uh, uh, was, was, was going to get, uh, an easy passing grade on anybody I brought home. Uh, why? Because that, that, that separation, uh, on the, on that basis was the tradition that had been passed on from generation to generation where I grew up in Louisiana.

Um, there's another one that's out today. Uh, that, uh, that we hear an awful lot of people say talking about honoring and honoring the tradition of the elders, honoring the tradition of the elders that were important in their time. And that has to do with, I think, the statues that grew up, uh, that, that, that surround, uh, many places.

Uh, where I grew up when I was a kid, establishes, uh, statues that, uh, honor. The dead of the, the Confederate, uh, um, states of the United [00:19:00] Confederate, states of America, the CSA, uh, statues of Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee and such. And, and, uh, and the way I was taught, they had always been there and we honor our dead and they were great people, et cetera.

And, and, uh, and I had no idea, you know, when I'm told, well, you can't, those things are sacred. They bringing him down. Will, will, will, will, uh, in some, some way. Impune, the honor, their honor, and the honor of all the forefathers who ever lived in our area, if we bring them down. And, and, and I, and I had no idea until recently that, uh, no, those statues were, weren't even erected until, uh, Jim Crow laws came about.

And it was, they were part of this, the myths that we needed to tell about a noble lost, lost cause, uh, that, that, uh, was the Civil War. Uh, and so the statutes went up as, uh, as ways of, of, uh, of. Of telling a, a, a new version of the story of what really happened. And so we have this leaven of the Pharisees that continues in our, our lifetime.

One of the, one of the things [00:20:00] that, that we have that's very similar in our history to what happened with the, here in this story of ritual cleansing, has to do with schisms that have happened in the church. In the church, uh. The, one of the, one of the schisms, perhaps the great schism of the church happened in the year 10 53 in the 11th century.

Uh, and that's the one where the Eastern Church and the Western Church split and are today still split over what? Over leavened bread on whether or not you needed to ritually to prepare the way in, in a certain way in order for it to be a valid Eucharist. That was what the fight was over, and then we haven't been able to get back together for a thousand years, uh, based on whether or not God smiled upon leavened versus unleavened bread in the, in the, uh, performance of the Eucharist, uh, in the Episcopal Church theism of 1870.

Uh. Came about because of eating, uh, sharing the Eucharist with the wrong people. An Episcopal priest in the state of New York, uh, [00:21:00] shared, uh, the Eucharist, presided at the Eucharist with a Presbyterian minister, which, uh, became a great scandal and a scandal that, uh, caused there to be an official ruling that thou shalt not ever do such a thing.

Uh, Dane to, uh, have holy communion with a. Protestant, uh, within the Episcopal church. And if you would, the priest could have his orders revoked, uh, which then led to the schism of 1870 where, uh, evangelical Episcopal churches is left en mass and formed their own church, the Evangelical Episcopal Church.

That still exists, uh, but we've lost most of our evangelicals in, in the Episcopal church. Oh, for what? How the rules pertaining to this ritual called the Eucharist. And um, and I've shared several stories with you guys that are along the, that same vein, uh, is a Eucharist valid if whites and blacks communed together?

That was a, a question that arose during the Civil War. And then again, I shared with you was a, was a. Issue at issue in the 1960s, [00:22:00] uh, within our own Episcopal church, uh, is a, is a Eucharist, uh, valid. Is, is, is the, is the, is the bread still holy if a black priest consecrates it? If a female priest consecrates it, if a gay priest, we've, we've had incredible arguments within the Episcopal church over the, these questions and, and then, um, and then, and one that's common to many of us, uh, make some of, some of you have.

May have been a part of this. Uh, is the Eucharist valid? If it's not right one, if it's not the 19, if the words that are said are not the 1928 prayer book, if it's, uh, is it only valid if it's spoken in Latin? Is it valid if it's not that old me, that old mass I memorized when I was a kid? These are things that still write rise up in us where we have the teaching of the elders.

This is the way we were taught it should be. And uh, and, and when it changes, we. Um, we struggle. I, I, uh, remember sitting when I was a seminarian and had a, a, a, a conversation that we never resolved, and the question [00:23:00] was, what constitutes a valid sharing of our bread together? Um, and, and the question that, the way I framed the question to the group that it generated some controversy as I asked them, well, let me ask you something.

If we all got together in the woods and there was not a table, there was not an altar, and we all, we had. Was a a, a bag of tortillas and some Coca-Cola and I went and did all, performed all the words that are in the Lord's Supper with those instruments instead of the traditional ones. Would that be a valid Eucharist?

Now, we never settled that question, but the the point I think illustrates the thing that Jesus is saying, we get so caught up in the substance and the form, and then that then gets passed down from generation to generation to generation that it then hardens into the law. Notice what Jesus is saying here is you.

Stop obeying the commandments of God and start obeying the commandments [00:24:00] of man, you made up the rules yourself. I'm calling you to obey God's teaching and not your own teaching. And that's what's at stake in this issue. That's his challenge to our faires of ways. One of the ways that I think we experienced 11 of the Pharisees in our time, uh, I'm gonna actually name two of them, uh, might surprise you.

Did you know that fully half of the bill of Rights in our constitution, constrain enforcement and punishment, half go look at it. You might surprise after the, uh, the, the, the, the discussion about freedom of expression, you know, speech and religion and, and our right to assembly and the right to a bear arms criminal justice.

Is the biggest deal in our Bill of Rights, but these rights at the time applied only to white male property owners originally, and they never applied to enslaved [00:25:00] persons in full. And from that, we developed very early on a tradition of applying these kinds, these concepts differently between whether or not you are a white male property owner.

Or not. And so there was a tradition of stop and frisk that was very much a part of our, uh, culture in America from the very beginning. Uh, you know, on anyone who looked like they might be an enslaved person. Of course we did away with that, uh, when we did away with Jim Crow. But did you know that in the 1980s our Supreme Court made clear to all the lower courts that from now on the Fourth Amendment should place no.

Meaningful constraints on police if they were stopping and frisking someone, like they have always stopped and frisk persons of color before in accordance with the war on drugs. So they carved out something on the war on drugs. And so what we have now in our time is the, is is the situation that that's been passed down for multiple [00:26:00] generations.

If you're being. If you're being taught as a police officer, uh, in which no one needs to be informed of their rights during a stop or search, and police may use minor traffic stops as well as the myth of consent to stop in search anyone they chose for imaginary drug crimes, whether or not there's any real evidence of probable cause, I'm quoting that last portion.

I'm actually quoting a book that I urge you to read called The New Jim Crow. Um, and this is a situation where we have, uh, generations of police officers being taught that, uh, the way of the elders is the stop in frisk ritual. Uh, and that, that stop in frisk ritual is about ensuring the safety of the people that they are in some way protecting by doing this, the, the constitution of the United States against domestic enemies, uh, by continuing the practice of stopping persons of color without probable cause for, that's the law I.

Of the [00:27:00] tradition, of the tradition of the elders that is being held down, handed down to them, uh, year after year. It's, it's always been that way. And, and, and that's just one example where we have, uh, uh, uh, something in our side, our, our society that I would characterize as the 11 of the Pharisees. And another one is one that we're seeing right now as, as this delta variant of the Covid virus arises.

Um, and that is this idea, this. Teaching that gets passed down from generation to generation in our country. That freedom, the freedom that the forefathers imagined for us, uh, that the founding fathers imagined for us, I should say, uh, is about a private space freedom. Uh, is, is is about you having a space that no one can enter.

No one can tell you what to do. No one can, uh, um, in any way, um, impinge upon your liberty to do whatever it it is that you would like to do. And, and so in our current context that then that teaching of [00:28:00] the elders, uh, uh, uh, result in many today saying masks and the wearing of masks are an assault on my freedom.

But when we get back and, and say, wait a minute, let's go look and see what God's instructions are, what we discover is, well, that's a teaching of the elders. That's a, that's a, that's man's teaching about what freedom is, but not what God's teaching, uh, tells us, uh, for God's teaching, uh, in the scripture that we find is that freedom is not about some protected space that is only yours.

Freedom is about liberation from mindsets that that impede your capacity, my capacity to love our neighbors as ourselves. Freedom is about learning how to find yourself by losing yourself. As Mark is about to teach us about learning how to live by learning how to love. That's what real freedom is.

Freedom is learning to willfully make space for others in our lives so that all may flourish. So. [00:29:00] When faced with the question of should I wear a mask? The question isn't about, uh, is, is, uh, wearing a mask, an assault on my freedom is freedom of private space as the elders have taught, many believe the elders have taught, uh, but rather, uh, put on a mask, not because the secular law demands it put on a mask because love of your neighbor and yourself command it.

You are free by putting on the mask. That's, uh, that's a, a different leaven. It's the, that's the leaven of Torah, of God's teaching it. That's, that's, uh, that's being brought to play here in our lives. I. So we have this wonderful story of Jesus in conflict with these, this really well-meaning people, the Pharisees, who are seeking to be more holy, but they have been led astray in the way they are going about that.

And Jesus, uh, here issues a, a very strong [00:30:00] differentiating corrective. And what I think there are two parts of, of good news here for us in this first is, is that we see implied that sin. Is not about willfulness. Sin is not about whether or not we are willful in impeding the work of God. Sin is about blindness.

The astigmatism of sin leads us to create unholy structures, unholy traditions that turn God's teachings upside down and obstruct the path to the living waters he's created in our wilderness Wanderings. Sins about ignorance and not, and not blindness. And therefore we can correct our vision, uh, learning to see and hear and smell in the way.

As we learned in the, in Lord has sin us the spirit to help us recognize the way of love. And the second thing is it's, you know, the sin is not about, is not about willfulness, but but, but ignorance that can be cured. The second part of that is that the, the cure is already present. [00:31:00] We have been given this living word.

And we've been given Jesus example, we've been given the spirit so that we can recognize the poisonous leaven of the Pharisees that we ourselves cultivate in the pursuit of our own bread making with each other. We've been given the nose to smell and the and, and to detect that spoiled leave. The test is simple.

Does this teaching, does this tradition that's been passed down to me, um, provide a, a place for all to flourish? That's the test. Does it create or perpetuate hierarchies of human value or does it set another place at the table so that all may feast at the table that the Lord sets for us? That's what's at stake in this conflict between our pharisaic ways and Jesus's ways.

God desires that. All inhabitants of God's created order. Live in fellowship with God and each other, and here's the really good news. He has [00:32:00] already given us everything that we need to do. Just that to prosper with you, with me, all of us together, suffering with our Lord in the wildernesses of our lives.

We take this good news and carry it out into the world and undo the Levin of the Pharisees that's among us and move our own communities in the gener, in, in the direction of this Levin that Jesus gives us. And the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
