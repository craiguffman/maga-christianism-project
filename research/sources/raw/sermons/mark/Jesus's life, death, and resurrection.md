# Why Did Jesus Have to Die\_-Up to 4K

[00:00:00] Hello, and welcome to Coffee Hour Questions. Today, I wanted to respond to a question I receive quite often. Why did Jesus have to die? Let's jump right into it. Before we get into an explanation, let's cover one thing we need, or one set of things that we need to presuppose. I call it the human problem.

Let's get on the same page there. And I want to just summarize this as a set of, of, of, uh, premises that we gather from all throughout the Hebrew and apostolic scriptures. I don't think they're con, uh, controversial in any sense, because the first step in thinking about resurrection and death is to recall what Jesus reveals what scripture, the scriptures reveal [00:01:00] that God wills that we become fully human as God imagines us homo sapiens, which is another way of saying that God wills that we become perfected in the good.

That God chooses for us. And Jesus reveals that the good that God wills for us consists of holy friendships with God and all of God's creation, all creatures. That's what constitutes the fullness of our humanity. That's a very important point because as we'll see what we're talking about is being restored to that possibility.

Now, there's a problem. The problem that is impeding God's will for us is that we don't actually currently bear that authentic humanity that's been revealed by Jesus. The, what they call in scripture, uh, the Omega Dei, the image of God, which means that we don't presently enjoy that holy faith. Friendship with [00:02:00] God and all of God's creatures that God wills for us.

And Paul spends a lot of time throughout his, uh, letters documenting the various ways that, uh, that, that, that is manifest. Um, they're in just the letter of Corinth, uh, that he, he sends to the church. The first, uh, the letter that he sends to the church of Corinth that we have, he backs up the claim that there's a problem with God's plan for us, that we don't currently bear that image of God that makes us full of human by describing about.

15 different examples in which our communion with God and each other is impaired. And when we read about the church at Corinth, I want to remind us that we're not reading about some distant and ancient people. We're reading about us. Like the people at Corinth, we can't live in proper relationship with each other or God.

And so, we have a problem, [00:03:00] and a problem from which we must be rescued by God. And so, in the, in the letter to the church at Corinth, he talks about hierarchies of human value. That's a key theme of Paul's, that exists, that ought not to exist among those who have, who have, uh, Been called by Jesus. Uh, there's examples of extreme partisanship, much like we have today in the United States.

There are broken families, both in terms of marriage and incestual relationships. They're suing each other. Uh, there's idolatry. Uh, meanwhile, the, the wealthy are letting the poor go hungry while they feast. Uh, so these are problems that we ourselves experienced today. Uh, and, uh, we, uh, have. Broken communities today that, uh, are deeply sinful, both big and small.

Um, and, and so that we have this relational damage that requires, uh, that there'd be some form of deliverance. And so that's what we want to talk about when we answer this question. Why did [00:04:00] God need to, um, deliver us through having Jesus die? So let's begin, uh, after that big picture, uh, by unpacking it. Um, We have to start not with what we think a good solution to that problem of the human condition might be or tell a story that serves our own purposes, our own agendas, but rather with what actually happened in history, which is resurrection.

Why resurrection? In other words, the question to ask first is not, why did Jesus die, but why was Jesus resurrected? That's the key to the question, to the mystery. And the answer is because resurrection is God's answer to the problem of death. Why did Jesus die? Because he was fully human, and humans die, and you have to die before you can be resurrected.

[00:05:00] Resurrection is the whole point. Why? Because resurrection is how God chose to solve another problem. The problem of death. Resurrection, you see, is only a partial solution for the problem of death. Jesus died. You and I are going to die. So death is still part of the story. It's, it, it, it's still part of us.

But why is that so? Well, it's because death is part of God's solution to, uh, a prior problem, which is our sin. Sin, uh, one of my mentors, Dr. Douglas Campbell, uh, gives a great, uh, analogy for me. You know, he describes it like a virus from which we have to recover. If you could imagine it as a virus like COVID 19, a virus that affects everyone in the world.[00:06:00] 

Uh, and it is something that, um, is, uh, is, is, It's so, uh, harmful that it, that it completely impairs our relation. And if we are infected with it, we can't go into the presence of God. If humanity carries the virus of sin, it can't be allowed, in other words, to live in the presence of God indefinitely, eternally.

Sin is the name we give to our acts of turning our eyes from our Creator and refusing to become fully human and choosing to debase ourselves, to become less than human. It's a name we give to our ways of rejecting the fellowship that God freely offers to us and the fellowship to which He calls us with each other.

Now, why do we do that? Well, [00:07:00] several reasons, because our, first of all, that our minds are internally divided. From within, we're often driven for a lust for power. We're driven to satisfy our hungers with material things that, uh, rather than through the holy friendships, uh, uh, with God and with each other, that is God's intention.

Or, we, engage in sloth. In other words, we call God a liar and believe that we are too small, too weak, to risk the costs of discipleship, uh, that generate such holy friendships. And so we refuse to engage them out of fear. And that's just the stuff that's in our heads. Our minds are divided because we are attacked by deceptive and evil forces who use misinformation to seduce us off the path to full humanity, full humanity that God wills for [00:08:00] us.

And so, We have divided minds. And so in order to solve the problem of sin, God needs to solve the problem of our divided minds. And now we're getting to the answer for why Jesus needs to die and why resurrection was so important. So let's recap a bit of that. Death is God's judgment. God's judgment on our sin on those acts.

I just described. We're created in the image of God so that we can share some partial capacity, uh, akin to God's for creativity. God calls us to create the good, but our sin causes us to do exactly the opposite. We don't create the good alongside God. We. Destroy the God that we destroy the good God gave us to steward and we create the privation of the good Which is evil.

Death is God's word on that. [00:09:00] God's judgment on our sin. God's no to those acts of destruction, to those acts by which we create evil. It's unworthy of us, and it's unworthy of unbroken communion with God and each other. We cannot have that and be infected with that and go into the presence of God. And so God judges it with death.

and allows it to wither. It has no future. God has determined that our sin can have no future. And that brings us to resurrection, our resurrection. You see, sometimes we do create the good that God wills and that the Son thinks, but death destroys that good too. Along with the evil in the, you know, the evil that [00:10:00] we create, both the good and the evil are destroyed at death.

And if that were the end of the story, there would be no continuity of the good we create. When we enflesh that image of God, we do in fact create that goodwill, but because there's no continuity, God needs a better solution to the problem of sin than simply death. And that's where our resurrection comes in.

You see, God ordained that the cross would not be the last word on Jesus, nor on us. Jesus resurrection, you see, is past, so he's alive in the present. His resurrection happened, and so he is now alive in the present, and he inaugurated, um, our resurrection at the same time. He says, so if [00:11:00] anyone is in Christ, in other words, participates in Christ, that person is part of the new creation.

The old things have gone away and look new. Things have arrived. And this is where we get to the epistle from Galatians. It's so famous. The world has been crucified to me through him. And I've been crucified to the world. Being circumcised or not being circumcised doesn't mean anything. All that matters is new creation.

We are made to be new creations and, and have new ways, new eyes to see. And so when we participate in this inaugurated resurrection, there is no Jew. no pagan, no slave or free, no male or female. All of you who are in Christ Jesus are one and the same. That's Paul talking about the significance of our baptism into Jesus's life and death.

And so, um, there is a new self, uh, there is a new Christ [00:12:00] in all. And, and, uh, and that then is God's solution. Not just God's solution to death, but God's solution to our sin. Not just God's solution to sin after we die, but God's solution to sin here. Now, we experience a new mind, and that new mind is characterized by that peace that Paul talks about that surpasses all understanding.

Our flesh has been executed, and through that new mind that's being transformed by the renewing of our lives, we learn to act as God always intended that we act. And when we do that, the good we do now And it's the fact of Jesus's resurrection in which we participate that enables us to have those divided minds that now know a new way of [00:13:00] being that are transformed by their renewing that enable us then to live in such a way that we can live in the fullness of communion with God in each other.

Now, we live in. In time, we live in space still. We're still finite. And so, as Luther put it, we're simultaneously sinner and saved. We are between times. That resurrection, though, is not something that we look forward to tomorrow. It's something that Christ has already inaugurated. It's here. It's now. And so, too, however, Or those powers in our sinful ways that cause our divided mind.

So we are in the process now of being rehabilitated and it's Jesus's resurrection in which we participate that performs that rehabilitation. It gives us those new eyes to see God's goodness all around us and [00:14:00] inspires us to co create that goodness in our own unique ways. Allows us to live with Easter's eyes and so that's my answer to the question of why did Jesus have to die not in order to be the lamb that that Substitutes for us or anything like that, but rather in a positive sense as God's solution that enables us to have a continuity and in an eternal relationship with God, uh, here, now, and after we die.

Hope that answers your question well. Godspeed.
