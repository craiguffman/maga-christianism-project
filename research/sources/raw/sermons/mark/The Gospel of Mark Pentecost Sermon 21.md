# The Gospel of Mark Pentecost Sermon 21

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. I wanna share a word with you on this Pentecost Sunday, and I thought a good place for us to start is why do we celebrate this feast day? Why is Pentecost such a, a time of joy for both Jews and Christians everywhere? Why, uh, is it the, uh, second most important, uh, most significant of the holy days for us Christians?

Well, I think a, a good way to get at that is to, uh, ask ourselves another question, a question about how we are to fulfill our mission as the church. Uh, you know, we, I've said many times that our mission is to, uh, to to live with God in each other, in holy fellowship, in such a way that we draw all the world into God's love.

Well, how do we do that? How do we know how to live with God and each other in such a way? Well, the [00:01:00] answer to that is what Pentecost celebrates. And to, to get at that, I wanted to, um, to, to dig down into, uh, really three kinds of answers. Uh, first, a historical answer and a theological answer, and then an ethical answer, uh, in order to really get an understanding of why we are so filled with joy, particularly on this day of, of Pentecost.

The historical answer begins with, with, with just a, a recognition of what the, the, the feast day actually was. Originally it was an agricultural celebration celebrating the harvest, in particular the wheat harvest. And, uh, um, over time, uh, you know, the, the, of course, the, the celebration would've been, you know, a celebration of Thanksgiving for, uh, primarily for just the blessing of, of bread on the table.

Literally with the wheat. But, uh, it wasn't just a, a, a, a harvest of the wheat. Uh, at the same time there'd be a harvest of orchards and vineyards and other [00:02:00] things. Uh, uh, the, the, the harvest of, of the, of the very first harvest of wheat usually coincided about seven weeks after, uh, the, the, the celebration we call, um.

Passover. And so that's where we get the name Pentecost. It means 50 days, and it time is set in, in, uh, uh, Deuteronomy and in Exodus, excuse me, Deuteronomy in numbers, uh, as, uh, being a, a week of weeks. And hence in, it's the, the, uh, uh, the, the 50th day after Passover. So, uh, but the, the historical celebration as an agricultural.

Um, period appeared at Thanksgiving for the agricultural blessings over time in Jewish thought. Certainly by the time of Jesus had had evolved into a broader celebration, not just of, of the blessings on the table, uh, you know, physically manifest, but also the blessings. [00:03:00] Uh, that go along with it, the blessings, uh, uh, that, that God doesn't just leave us alone in the sense of saying, give me, uh, you heard the first fruits of your harvest in, in Thanksgiving.

'cause I'm the one who provides those. He also tells us how to live, how to go about that. And so he does that through Torah, through God's instruction. Uh, which, uh, for the Jews and for us would've been God's, uh, law revealed certainly at Mount Sinai, but also God's word, uh, revealed through. Uh, the pro, the prophets and through the, uh, mid rash on their teachings over time.

Um, and so as God, it's a celebration of God's revelation. And with regard to the agricultural celebrations, it would've been, uh, God's instructional need. How to go about that harvest. And so there would've, there would've been included in God's instruction, uh, rules pertaining to how we, uh, achieve a fair and just society so that there's a rule gardening, uh, you know, governing gleanings, you know, you, you don't glean your fields.

You leave, um, [00:04:00] the edges of those fields, uh, available to, uh, the, the, uh, alien and the widow and the orphan so that they might also reap God's blessings. Even though they may not be able to, uh, work in those fields anymore. Very compassionate thought. And also, uh, part of God's instruction was that, uh, uh, we don't work, uh, seven days a week, but we take time to celebrate time with God.

We take time to celebrate Sabbath. We take time to rest. And so all rest, not just us humans, but also uh, animals. Uh, who, who participate in the harvest rest, at least every Sabbath day. And so, uh, from, from that kind of thing, you get a, uh, a fair and just, uh, way of life, a life that is manageable. And so over time, that, uh.

That kind of celebration of the God's instruction pertaining to the harvest, uh, was [00:05:00] expanded such that it became a celebration of all of the revelation, uh, the means by which God teaches us how to live with God and each other. So that's the historical answer. Now let's talk about a theological answer.

Um, and, and I think this one is, is certainly important 'cause it gets, it. It begins with what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be, uh, God's creatures? Uh, the people who, uh, understand that we have, uh, no meaning apart from our relationship with God. Um, and so Pentecost recognizes that God and God's divine self establishing determined that, uh, there is this eternal movement by God, uh, pret temporally, God willed, that all creation would be eternally in a particular relation to our creator, a relation of action in which God moves.

Eternally towards God's creation. And, and, and God also will, that the very being of all, of God's creature, [00:06:00] whether they're humans, animals, or plant life, uh, entail a relatedness to God and to each other. That is essential to our nature. A relation of action that meets God, uh, in God's. Uh, movement towards us with a symphonic and reciprocal movement towards our creators.

So there's a, a symphony of all of creation that is responding to God's graciousness. Uh, and precisely because of, of that humans are essentially relational. Uh, we are ourselves when we are moving towards God and towards each other and towards all of our fellow created beings. And, and our reality consists of, in other words, we are real.

We are who we are meant to be. Our lives are full and in our human, in our case, uh, when we are actually doing this action, when we are not doing this action, we're not doing this movement towards God, uh, symphonically, uh, you know, with each other, uh, well then we are not being [00:07:00] human. And, uh, so that's what it means, this reciprocal and symphonic movement towards our creator.

And so this is the thing I'm describing is known as the covenant of grace, where, uh, we live in such a way now, Torah. Is basically God's revelation of how to do this to how to do this movement. It's God's revelation of our steps in this holy dance, and for that teaching, for that, for God's ongoing revelation.

It's not a static revelation, as we will see in shortly, but a, a dynamic revelation. Uh, that teaches us how to do our part in the holy dance and for, for that, uh, because it's teaching us what it means to be human. Uh, as we go about the process of being human, we celebrate God's providence now an ethical re answerer.

And to, to get at that, I want to. Uh, have us, uh, consider, uh, a case. There's a case before that's just arising in the, in, you know, with our Supreme Court. It's just, uh, [00:08:00] granted the decision that it will, uh, consider, um, a, an abortion case outta the state of Mississippi in which they outlaw. Uh, they ban, um, abortions after the, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, 15th week, uh, that are, that are not due to.

Um, particular conditions in the fetus or due to the, to the, uh, potential risk of life, uh, to the mother. Uh, and so this is gonna be granted, and so we, once again, we're going to be. Um, discussing as a society that's gonna be something that's gonna in, you know, be a very much a part of our daily politics is this decision about what does it mean to be a nation that, that, um, that, that says yes to life, uh, and yet finds a place for.

Uh, abortion. How do we go about even thinking about it? And there's the sense that we have not had peace with, with the decision that our Supreme Court made, uh, back in 1973. Now, my point today is not to [00:09:00] to, um, you know, come out on, on an, an opinion on what the Supreme Court should do. Uh. The, the Episcopal Church has a, has a, a large body of doctrine on how we think about the topic of abortion, and I would, you know, refer you to that.

However, what I wanted to get is there's this, these, these questions that come about in our, in our life and, and where we, we say, well, how do we as Christians even think about this problem? Because scripture doesn't tell us Scripture doesn't deal. With the details of this phenomenon, in this case of, of abortion, it doesn't deal with a lot of the phenomena of our current life.

Uh, and so, uh, so how are we to think about these things? And we begin with the idea that, uh, from the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God. And from that, we, we derived this understanding that God's eternal law, God's eternal law, the logos was, is and will always be, has been with us.

And that [00:10:00] all of our laws and customs that we, um, we use to guide our own human behavior, our communal behavior and our individual behavior, uh, are derived from the derivative works of our sense of what it means to live with God and what pleases God passed down from generation to generation dialectic.

Ally discerned and amended over time, such that in, in our laws and our customs, whether we're at the communal or family level, uh, they, they all have embedded in them this sense of what God has been teaching us. Um. And, uh, because that we, because of that manner of, of discerning them, uh, and the fact that we are doing that discerning and we are finite creatures, they are inherently ambiguous.

We inherently get some of it right and inherently get some of it wrong. Uh, and so it's always a dialectical process of our discerning God's word. But the point of that is that, [00:11:00] uh, good laws. Uh, tend to be expressed in very general language and the more far reaching the consensus to which we listen as we try to figure out what to do well, more, the more generally that judgment will be expressed in custom and law.

The, the more far reaching it is, the, the more general the language and, and, and, uh, so in other words, it's not as particular. It's not as. As, uh, it's not as discreetly reaching into the particular situations. And as a result of that, the universal laws and traditions lead inherently to inequity. Uh, we try to apply a, a law, uh, we always reach, uh, situations where the law, uh, seems to say, well, this can't be what God would want.

And we've just encountered in our work through the gospel of Mark. You know, several of those examples where Jesus says, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't you guys know the Sabbath was made for, for man, not man, for the Sabbath. [00:12:00] Uh, and so Jesus again and again challenged our general answers, uh, our universal answers that the Pharisees were given, uh, we're giving, uh, to questions that were everyday problems.

You know, if I'm hungry, can I eat? Can I do the work of, of eating, uh, eating, you know, and harvesting corn and cutting corn in a field? If, if someone is sick on Sabbath, can I do healing? And, and Jesus again and again, we'll challenge our very generalist, uh, uh, responses that we've encoded into our understanding of God's law and says, no, God intended for us to, uh, use our minds and to, and to, and to discern.

Uh, the intent behind, uh, God's law in order to figure God's will in a particular situation. And, and because when we don't do that, what we end up doing are things that don't make sense. From a justice perspective, [00:13:00] Universalist reasoning fails to achieve the good that God's law intends because it fails to attend to the material circumstances that really ought to shape our reasoning.

And therefore we need help. We need help in recognizing the actions that manifest the good. In each and every particular situation. And that leads us to our understanding of, uh, the, the, what we celebrate today with the Pentecost. And so we have in our text today from Romans, uh, Paul talking though about how, how all of created order is laboring towards the, to towards the point at which we all manifest the good that God desires.

Us to manifest so that we are fully what we were called to be. And uh, and, and, and God has sent along a companion, the Parly, the one who comes alongside to, to help us discern God's will. And so Paul writes in, in our text today in the same way the Spirit comes to help our weakness. We don't [00:14:00] know what we should pray, but the spirit.

Pleads our case with unexpressed groans, the one who searches hearts, knows how the spirit thinks because he pleads for the saints that's us, consistent with God's will. In other words, the spirit, uh, praise on our behalf as we seek to, uh, discern what God's will is. And then in gospel of John reading today, uh, it's, you know, Jesus makes this very promise when the spirit of truth comes.

He will guide you in all truth. And so the answer to the question of how we know what in each and every moment is God's will. What we, how do we know, uh, how do we have the possibility of knowing? Uh, it, it, you know, it's, it's given in our text today, it's, it's that Jesus is Jesus who is the word, has sent Jesus's spirit to be a part of us, to be persistently a part of our lives.

Uh. And that spirit prays on [00:15:00] our behalf and helps us to recognize the truth about what God's will is in a particular moment. And so, uh, these general answers, uh, are something that are enshrined in our traditions and customs, and they are good. But yet we've been given these brains in the spirit to help us discern in the particular case what we ought to do.

And that's what we celebrate today. Today. That's the good news because it means that we're not alone. We're never left to ourselves to guess how to live with each other and with God. And Fellowship for God has sent God's spirit to be with us. And that's the celebration that Pentecost is, has always been about for Jews and Christians.

It's this gift of God's teaching. I. And it means that God is with us just like on Christmas. Pentecost truly is a celebration of God with us and in this case, in a particular way, through the gift, the persistent gift of God's Holy Spirit. And what better news can I give [00:16:00] on this day than just to celebrate that wonderful, wonderful blessing?

Be with the Spirit in the name of the Father, son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
