# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 16

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Let's, uh, start today in our consideration of the gospel mark with, uh, the headlines from the New York Times, uh, that, uh, uh, I, I could have picked from, you know, any newspaper across the country. There would've been something about our pandemic today because we are struggling once again, in particular parts of our country are struggling.

But I would, my mind was captured today by a headline. About, uh, Austin, Texas. Lovely, lovely city capital of one of our largest states, and, uh, the concerns there that their hospitals are being overrun. I got a text message this morning from my eldest brother saying the same is true in Baton Rouge, my old hometown.

I. Uh, and, and, and in each of these areas, uh, what we're seeing is that there's a real struggle as we think about sending kids back to school and all those things because the city officials, as it says here in this, this quote from the article, the authorities in Austin, Texas warned, uh, that the [00:01:00] city's COVID-19 situations grown desperate.

Because why? Because a surgeon cases driven by the Delta variant swap the hospitals and the city officials. Were prevented from issuing mandates for masks and vaccinations. Why? Because the governor of the state. Had issued a, uh, an executive order prohibiting city officials from, from, uh, issuing such mandates.

Um, so they're, they, they risk, uh, legal sanction at the state level being sued if they require children to wear masks to school or required folks to be vaccinated. And, uh, this is a story that I'm, I'm. Not trying to pick on the governor of Texas. Uh, I could equally, uh, point to Arizona and Arkansas and Florida and other places that are struggling these days.

Uh, and I, and I, my point really isn't to belabor, uh, the topic about the vaccination, but [00:02:00] rather just ask us to think about what. The what this, uh, uh, set of headlines, uh, means in terms of what we are teaching our children. So if you, if you unpack the justification that we see, we hear so often these days of why, uh, the it, you know, a governor is justified in saying it's against the law.

It's against an executive order for you to require a child or anyone else to wear a mask to school. Even though it might save lives, uh, what you see is, uh, logic, like the following. It begins with a premise. And that premise is that our highest value is something that, uh, we revere as freedom. Now, we're not all.

As we've spoken about in the past, quite clear on what we mean by freedom. And so the, what I infer as I hear people talk is that they are, uh, assuming a certain definition of freedom, which I will, I will, uh, preface, uh, [00:03:00] uses a, you know, foreshadow. Where I'm headed with this is I don't agree with this free, this justification, excuse me, with this, uh, understanding of what freedom is.

I don't think it's a biblical understanding. But what it, what basically, uh, is, is assumed here, is that freedom means that, uh, this thing that is my highest value means that I am, you know, king George is not the monarch. Uh, I am the monarch. I am the monarch of my own private space. My private judgment, uh, is a space of holiness that I must defend and guard against all invaders and, and requiring a mask.

Or requiring that I be vaccinated is an invasion of my private space, and therefore, uh, if someone invades my private space, it means I'm no longer free. And so requiring a mask or requiring me to be vaccinated, um, uh, is, is simply something that must not happen. And that's the justification that Governor Abbott gave, uh, pretty bluntly.

Uh, and, and, and [00:04:00] I, I, uh. Understand it. And I think it is a perspective, I wanna label it a worldly perspective for you because it very, as we have talked about in recent weeks, it very clearly is not the way Paul and the biblical writers understood the gift of freedom. So what is that kingdom perspective that we've been seeing the gospel of Mark?

I just as a way of reminder, wanna refresh our minds and not. Drill into it a lot today. 'cause we've done, we've, we've drilled so much into it. But the, the first thing is that for what does it mean to be free, well free to be free, is to be engaged in a continuous improvement project. First of all, it's, it's to be free is, is about learning.

And this, this, uh, uh, is, is, is a learning of a particular thing, a particular behavior. And that is the behavior that we call love. So to be free is to be, is to learn to love. And it's not, it is not something that we ever stop. Uh, doing, uh, so the exercise of our freedom is the exercise of learning to love and, and what do we say?

I talk about love. We have a particular meaning of love. It's not that [00:05:00] sappy Hollywood thing that says, yeah, I feel I have good feelings about something, someone, or something, you know, to love is, is an action, and it is a movement towards those from whom we are estranged. And from whom are we estranged?

Well, we understand that from our genesis story in which we learn of, you know, the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel we're estranged from each other, male and female. We are estranged from each other. Brother and brother. Sister and sister. We are estranged from each other. Uh, and, and, and we are estranged from the created order.

Uh, as well, not just of our fellow homo sapiens, but from all of God's creations, we are estranged and so to love is to actually, uh, atone. It's to, it's to move towards and to be reunited with all of those in the created order. And so the purpose of gift of, of gift of freedom has a context then it is about reconciliation.

It's about God's act of [00:06:00] reconciling us to. Those from whom we are estranged. Why? So that we might be fully human, because as Jesus teaches us to be fully human is to be as one with all whom God loves. And so God is acting to reconcile us, first of all with God, and then also with all of God's created order so that we receive it all as an overflowing gift.

So a love. Is is to be as one with others. To be free is to be learning how to do that well. That's the kingdom perspective that we've been seeing throughout the gospel of, of Mark and I, I, I bring all of this up as a preface to, to talk about something that s and I have been talking an awful lot about as we struggle to parent young children in this society.

Uh, where, where the pandemic, you know, for, for our littlest, our smallest one. Uh, uh, you know, you know, the pandemic rep represents, uh, almost a third of his life. Um, so this is what he's [00:07:00] seen and the way adults are responding and they're teaching him something quite important. And so we see ourselves in, in engaged in a fight for our children's souls.

Uh, and, and I I, I know from talking to other parents, that's true of many. And, and one of the, the, the, the reason this is such a struggle is because of the messaging. That we are giving our children. And repeatedly what they are being told is that you are the center of the universe. This private space, uh, concept of, you know, reinforcing this notion again and again and again, that you yourself are the center of the universe.

And, and, and another thing that we see in the way we have. Uh, become so atomized in our world with our iPhones and our private playlists and our Instagram and, and all of these things is that we're teaching our children that my life, your life is a drama of which you are the star young child. And that, that, that generates problems, we.

When we begin to tell our story as a [00:08:00] story about ourselves rather than a story about God, and God is the subject of our story, God is the scar of our story. Uh, but rather we, we, we pivot and, and make it a story about ourselves. Well then we're telling a story that is not recognizable by the Bible and it's not one that is a story of the reconciliation, uh, that God is seeking for us.

'cause when we're reconciled, we recognize God as the primary actor in our drama. And it's a. Uh, it is a, it is a magnificent theo drama of which we are a small part, and when we have this perspective, we then generate other, uh, challenging mental perspectives. We begin to see that the other persons in my life are not subjects.

They're not subjects who are actors in my drama who act upon me, to whom I then respond and then have a beautiful history together, but rather. They're mere objects. They are resources on a spreadsheet. Uh, they're not people to whom I am [00:09:00] sent, uh, to be as one, uh, but rather they are people I am to consume.

Uh, and, and that, uh, that is going in the opposites actually frustrating God's kingdom perspective. Uh, but this is one of the things that we are teaching our children, uh, in our society today. As we've, we've talked about in the past. Uh, one of the things that we see very commonly. Is, uh, is when we become the stars of our own story and we, we tell our story, uh, in such a way that we are, uh, the stars of that story.

Well, we have to be the heroes of that story. And if we are the heroes, uh, that story, well then, uh, most often, uh, when we tell our story, uh, we have to explain the bad things that happen to us in ways that make other people responsible for those things, uh, and that we do. That's exactly what we do. It's not because of the choices that I have made in my life with, with this disease that is attacking me [00:10:00] or this, this, uh, tragedy that is attacking me or this, uh, loss of opportunity, uh, that is frustrating me.

No, it's not because of the choices I have made. It's because someone else, someone else on stage here, not one of the main actors, but one of the ones that has appeared as a resource is failing me. They have failed to give me the love that is my due. They have failed to give me the respect. That is my due.

That's why I am failing. That's why I'm suffering. That's why I have, uh, these things happening to me. I, it just, and, and the, and, and, uh, there's nothing I can do about it because they're the ones who are doing it with me. They only, they would just stop rather than the sense of responsibility that Jesus teaches us, uh, as we, as he teaches us the way of love.

And one of the things that we also see, and that we see, I think particularly in our pandemic, is this idea. That, uh, uh, you can tell that I am the hero of my story and the way I [00:11:00] show you that they, that I'm the hero of my story is by manifesting my power over my space. If, if, uh, if you see that I am in control of my space, well then you acknowledge my power and that I am.

Lifted up. And so, uh, we see that, uh, I think here in, in our story, the way we think about whether we should wear masks when we go into public or whether we should get vaccinated. But we also see it in the Me Too movement. We are where, you know, generations of men have been taught to dominate. The spaces they occupy, uh, by consuming others and particularly women as, as resources.

And, and we certainly see it in the, in the context of the story of our racialized American, uh, history in which we whites, I. Particularly we white males and Anglo-Saxon Protestants have dominated all the spaces and demand that we continue to dominate all the spaces that we occupy. These are not biblical perspectives, but just to ask, I ask us to [00:12:00] think for a minute what it means to be a child who grows up.

With all this messaging, how do we combat this? If we truly believe that Jesus is the Lord of the world? If we truly believe that Jesus is the one who schools us in what it means to be human? Well, that's the kind of conversation. Uh, uh, SJI and I have been having, as we've been trying to, uh, to guide our youngest two children most recently, uh, on vacation in, in Maine.

And, and whenever I, uh, get, uh, confused about, uh, of these things, I turn to either the Bible or of course the Eagles. My favorite, uh, singing group, uh, who, who, I don't know if you, you know, uh, they seem they have some really fine, uh, music that I would categorize as Christian music. And their, their best album in my view is the 2007 one.

The last one when they were basically the age of most of our congregation. They had accumulated some wisdom, [00:13:00] uh, in their, in their mid sixties. They came out with this, um, this album, the Long Road Out of Eden that I commend to you. And what are their songs? Uh, is just simply one of my favorites, you know, and it says, you know, this is not the center of the universe.

And so I wanted to share the lyric, uh, with which it begins. And, and I always read this text. I don't know what the, the eagles were, you know, Glenn Fry and all those guys were thinking when they wrote it, but, uh. Uh, to me, I imagine this as a lyric, as they're giving the voice like an oracle of, of God, like the prophet Isaiah does.

In words. These are the words of God speaking to us and, and, and, and in the song, uh, from the album Long Road Out of Eden, in this, this particular song called Center of the Universe. You know, I imagine when I hear a God's voice saying to us, I come before you with my heart in my hand, hoping you can see me through this veil of tears.

Somehow I've got to make you understand. Don't you know me after [00:14:00] all these years? Oh, love. I hate to disappoint you, but there's something you should know this. Is not the center of the universe. That's all right with me, but this is not the center of the universe, but it's where I wanna be. I think that's what God says to us in the stories again and again that we see in the gospel of Mark Jesus reminding us that, uh, this place that we occupy is not the center of the universe, but even though we.

Act that way. God is gonna remind us that it's not the sinner, but yet, but wherever we are is where God wants to meet us. That's what I have seen. So all of this is context for, uh, conversations that I just wanna share with you. So Jean and I had, uh, up in Maine and I just, some images, I think, uh, our ways that we were trying to teach our kids, which sort of provide an antidote.

To all of this messaging we were seeing. And, and Sina said to, to me, you know, when we, we talked about, well, what would be, what [00:15:00] would this thing look like? What would success look like on our vacation? And, uh, I gave my answer and, but her answer was, was, uh, as usual, you know, filled with wisdom, she said. I want to teach the kids how to be still.

I want to teach them how to be still before the Lord. And so we hiked. We hiked and we hiked every single day. We hiked and we saw marvelous places. And you can see, so Gina and there's sun there, just. Learning to be still being taught to how to be still by her mother. Uh, so that, that she learns that she is not the center of the universe.

And one of the ways that we did that, uh, was, uh, to stand, uh, on a, in a, in an area in called Ships Harbor, where there's this wonderful Granite beach, uh, and I mean, granite Beach, I'll show you a picture in a moment. There's, there's, there's, uh, a beach that, uh, consists of. Very large rocks all and then [00:16:00] small rocks, and then smaller rocks and smaller rocks all the way down to sand.

That is almost a red sand. And you can, you can see, and I, and I, and I think the last verse of the Eagle's song that I've committed to you captures, uh, this, this thing that we are trying to teach them. It's God saying to us, I will be with you everywhere you go. In gentle breezes that caress your skin. I thought of that as I, as I saw that picture of sun just soaking in the breeze at the top of, of Acadia Mountain and, uh, and God being there, the gentle breeze that caresses your skin.

And you will see me in the silent snow and in the slash phrase and in everything that comes round again. I thought of that, everything that comes round again, and that was my theme in talking to the kids about this speech because we, we, we, I asked them to hold in their hands the, the, some, you know, just some of the sand and, and just think about the billions of years of God providing life and [00:17:00] God, uh, reconstituting life in new ways and providing life, uh, from the residue of death.

Uh, and so we. You know, on this beach, you know, they picked up all sorts of shells and they, and they saw how, uh, the shells were mixed in with, uh, the, you know, and, and found life. Uh, the, the snails that occupied the sne, the, the, the, the shells found life in the homes of, uh, that had been created by people or, or creatures that had gone before them.

And we, we were marveled at just the amount of life that they could hold in, in one hand, and that, that is the creator. That, that we are asked to come to know, uh, and that we do come to know, and we do come to see when our site is restored, when we recognize that we aren't the center of the universe. So all of that is actually a preface for our gospel story today.

And I, I wanted to begin with something that, for me, is a very clear biblical reference that Mark makes in his gospel. This very small story, just four verses in the [00:18:00] gospel. Mark the eighth chapter, as I shared with you in the last week. Uh, we have finished the first half of the Gospel of Mark. It's all about the story of Galilee.

And, and in the story, uh, the center of it, the stage, uh, if we were imagining the, you know, he, mark had painted a stage where the entire story takes place around the Sea of Galilee or the Lake of Galilee, which mark, uh, characterizes as a. Sea, the place of disorder. And if we've talked about how, uh, you know, the theme of it is this movement of boundary crossing, of reconciling the Jew with the Gentiles.

And so, again and again, there was these voyages across this sea of disorder, uh, in which the, the disciples would often fail as they went from their home homeland into. The place where they felt alien. The, uh, the, the know, the, the land of the Gentiles. Uh, and uh, and, and so that was the context. Well, that now we we're, we're done with that.

Uh, in the, in the remaining part of gospel, all of that [00:19:00] will not appear in the story anymore because Mark is, is gonna pivot. And the second half of March's gospel is a story of another journey, not from one side of the sea to the other, but from a place called Beth. The birthplace of of Peter, Andrew, and Philip.

The northernmost point that Jesus will, will see Jesus going all the way down to Jerusalem and there so the rest of his gospel is telling a new story. These same themes will resonate, but another one will resonate. And, and then, and that theme is introduced. Jesus, mark very clearly makes some references to something that would've been familiar, sorry, in scripture.

I'm having trouble hearing you. Um, and uh, and, and that is from the prophet Isaiah, where we have this motif of, uh, of, of blindness. And so in chapter 29, we see Isaiah, uh, proclaiming the the day of the Lord. And when it comes, when the day of Lord comes, well, on that day, the death shall hear the words of a scroll, and out of the gloom and outta the darkness, the [00:20:00] eyes of the blind shall see.

And then, and then again in chapter 35, we see the same motif, then the eyes of the blind and the day of the Lord, the eyes of the blind shall be opened. And the ears of the death unstopped. And then chapter 43, my favorite passage in, in, in the prophet of Isaiah, where, where there is the, the part where, where Jesus, I'd rather, where, where, uh, Isaiah says, in God's words, I have called you by name.

Well, in that passage where he's speaking about the, the, you know, the. Bringing forth of all of the disciples. He says, well, so, so I have called you by name. So bring out the blind people who have eyes. Bring out the deaf ones who have ears, and then it continues. Why are you to bring out the, the, the blind who have, have, have eyes?

Because you are my witnesses, says the Lord. My servant whom I chose so that you would know and believe me, and understand that I am the one before me. No, God was formed after [00:21:00] me. There has been no other. In other words, if you wanna know where the center of the universe is. It's there with the one who called you by name.

So this story takes place in Beida, and it's, as I mentioned, it's the birthplace. It's where we see Peter, Andrew, and, and Philip were born. Uh, John Gospel. John tells us that, uh, they live in Capernaum, uh, as fishermen, as you know. Uh, the important thing about this is that Beida was at the, at the mouth of the Jordan River.

It was an ancient, simply a village. It was just an old village, but it had had something happen to it that, for Jews was a bad thing. It was a Jewish fishing village that haired the great raised and then rebuilt in his own image as a hellenized city. So he had basically displaced the Jews and then built there a hellenized city, in other words, one that that adopted a worldly [00:22:00] culture.

It adopted a ways of seeing the world, which were not a biblical world. I hope that sounds familiar to you, uh, because that's the challenge I think that, you know, they had then was, you know, raising their children as Jews would've been very challenging. Much like it is for us to raise folks, uh, children with a kingdom perspective today.

So we get in the gospel story, this, this wonderful thing where we see that Jesus and his disciples. Came to Beth Sa. I wanna re remind you that in chapter six, verse 45, and following you, you see a story where the Jesus and his disciples got in a boat and they will go into Beth Sa. They were going back to the place known to Philip and Andrew and, and Peter, but they never made it there.

Remember that They, they, they, they, uh, they, they weren't able to get across. And, and, and Jesus used that then to make a point about their blindness because they, again, they, he tells the story about the. About the loaves of bread. They don't get what had happened in the wilderness. And so they end up going some other place.

They never get to buy be Sida. So now they finally do arrive at [00:23:00] Beth Sida. They finally get to that destination 'cause they've learned some things along the way. And as they get there, some villagers. Now this is a Hellenized village. These are not Jewish folks, likely, uh, they brought a blind man to Jesus.

And as we have seen in uh, earlier stories, they begged Jesus to touch and to heal him. And so what did Jesus do? I think this is very interesting. Uh, Jesus didn't do that right there in the village. He accepted the mission, but instead he led the man out of the village. He led him out of, he called him out of his culture, his cultural location.

He took him away from it all. And I'll remind you, for me, I hear echoes of the word ecclesia. The word we get, you know, church is, you know the word church. Eccle means the. People called out. And so this blind man was called out by Jesus of his village. And then Jesus did, like, he, he did in a few stories earlier.

He, he, he took his spittle, uh, you [00:24:00] know, as we, we talked about then, uh, you know, bursting a boundary because that would've been unclean. And he rubbed it on his eyes and, uh, and he, and he laid it on his, on him. And he said, Hey, do you see anything? Well, of course the, we would expect to see is the data would be healed immediately.

But hold on for a second. That's not actually what happens because the man in destiny looks up and says, I see people, they look like trees. Only they are walking around. So he has some vision restored, but he, he, like you and I who see through the astigmatism of sin, we don't see the world rightly. We, we see things happening, but it, it's fuzzy.

It's not quite, we see through a glass darkly right now. So too, this man had been healed but he didn't see fully. Right? Uh, and, and so it took more than just one pass by Jesus. It took a couple of stages. 'cause then, then Jesus having had, you know, done this first stage of healing. Placed his hands on the man's eyes [00:25:00] again.

And then, and only then, after Jesus had done that second pass, the man looked with his eyes wide open and his eyes, his sight was fully restored. And he wasn't like you and me, who see through a glass darkly. He could see everything quite clearly. And so Jesus sent him away, said, Hey dude, don't go back into that village.

You know, don't go back. Don't go back. I just delivered you from there. I've taught you to see, don't go back to that lifestyle, that way of seeing the world. So I think it's a real simple story that's filled with some really good news. And I just wanna point out a few things. Uh, one is that, uh, Jesus is constantly calling us out of our cultural location and into his kingdom in order to, to teach us how to be free.

To teach us the true meaning of freedom, to teach us how to love each other, to see each other [00:26:00] as the subjects that we are, uh, those as to see each other as gifts who are given to each other, uh, so that we enjoy the love that, that God intends for us all to enjoy. And so, uh, that, uh, can be very painful to enter into a new.

Uh, a new place where we, uh, we we're not comforted by, um, the, the, the, the, the, uh, morays, the values, the teachings that dominate our culture. And then the second point I think, is that Jesus restores us, not immediately. So if you yourself have had been given partial vision. You know, or if you've been given a partial vision and a full vision and then lost that vision.

What, what John Wesley called backsliding. Well, that's, that's sort of the Christian story. That's the story that Mark is going to be telling about us disciples. And the, the second half of the story, there's gonna be this tension between Jesus and the [00:27:00] disciples is. Continually, continually, they see the the right things and they say the right things, but they don't quite get who he is.

They don't quite get it. And so I think it's good news to know that we are sort of like those disciples. God is healing us in stages. Eventually the disciples will get it, but not right away. And so if that's where you are. Today, be at peace and stay on the journey. Stay on the journey with Jesus and he will heal you in stages.

And I, I think the, the, the last point that I wanna make is, is that is the story that we're going to see going forward. I this, these four verses. Don't quite tell it, but you will see it. And that is this, what we're going to see is the story of, of Jesus being in conflict again and again, and with, with the, the Pharisees and now with the Jerusalem authorities who are gonna threaten his life because his word challenges the dominant culture, his word challenges, the, the, the [00:28:00] teaching that you are the center of the universe.

Uh, and he, and as he teaches that word, and as we begin to trust in that word, uh, again, well, the, the, the culture pushes back and we're gonna see that it's gonna push back against Jesus real hard. And Jesus is gonna teach us that, uh, uh, that you know, this, this business, that the last shall be first and the first shall be last, which is the kingdom perspective is hard for us to get.

The culture's gonna resist it, but nonetheless. We will see stories intermixed, intermixed into all those moments of tension like this healing of the deaf man, I mean the blind man. Uh, and which even though we disciples, it seems we'll never quite get it. There will be times when we do, mark seems to be saying that.

Expect it to be hard. Expect it to feel like, we'll, we'll the kingdom will never [00:29:00] prevail, but then you'll, there'll be these moments, there'll be these moments when you'll just know and you'll experience the fullness of God's love in your life and you'll see someone else. You'll see your own children experiencing that.

So have faith there is cause for hope, because that's the way. God teaches us to be truly free one stage at a time. It takes time all in God's time, and I think that's the good news folks, on this 11th Sunday after Pentecost, in the name of the Father, son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Then.
