# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 23

[00:00:00] Okay, so this week we're gonna continue in talking about the Gospel of Mark. We'll have some echoes of, uh, of, of our. Uh, liturgical topic, which is the, the, the reminder of, uh, of the, of the, the beauty, the reality of the Trinity. Uh, but we're gonna focus, uh, particularly on the, the moves that happen in Mark's gospel.

We're gonna be continuing our effort to, to read Mark's gospel. Literarily, in other words, as a work of art, uh, that was very intentionally constructed with all sorts of echoes from the Hebrew scriptures that inform us in how in, in, in the deeper meanings of what Mark is saying. Uh, today we. Uh, encounter a shift of setting, um, a shift of, of, uh, focus.

Uh, we, we see a shift in strategy from Jesus in the last several weeks. We, we've gone through Jesus's [00:01:00] announcement of his new ministry and then a series of engagements with, uh, the, the, uh, the scribes who ran the synagogues in Galilee with the Pharisees, with, uh, the scribes who have come up from. Uh, from Jerusalem, you know, as you know, sort of like our Washington DC who had the power of death.

And what we've seen is Jesus repudiating, um, their, um, their distortion of the. Of, of, of ministries, of, of gifts, of things that were intended to be blessings into things that had become curses on the people. And so we, we, there was a strategy of re remediation. And now over the next few chapters from chapter five through eight, we're going to see a shift in Mark's gospel.

And we're gonna see Jesus shifting as well in his ministry to what I'm gonna call a strategy of reconstructing, reconstructing the kingdom and restoring it to what God. Always intended. And so over the next few weeks, we're gonna [00:02:00] see these stories of, again, of, of more and more dramatic healings. But we're also gonna see, uh, feedings feeding, uh, two feedings in the wilderness.

And we're gonna see lots of journeying to and fro as Jesus seeks to go. Forge a new kingdom, uh, without destroying the old, you know, within the old. And so far what we've seen is Jesus confronting the, the powers and principalities with a, a militant non-violence. And we saw him in our last week before.

Pentecost, uh, reminding that the, the, uh, disciples whom he had gathered of the virtue of patience, reminding them that, uh, they should expect the, that the ministry into which they're called will, uh, will be received by some and rejected by others. Uh, and so that they needed to have that faith of a mustard seed and that faith that the kingdom is like a mustard seed that would, would, from a very small beginning grow into something, [00:03:00] uh, that, uh, would be able to provide shade to all the nations, to all the world.

And so, so in the, in this as, as Jesus pivots, what we see him doing is now. Going out and actually, uh, demonstrating his alternative set of social practices, his alternative practices, this alternative way of being that we call the way of love. Uh, and it's a, it's a way of love, which, uh, is characterized by, as we know, inclusivity and compassion.

Where compassion is passion. That is with, you know, with the other. And we'll see someone who is. Uh, who, who is the powers of the Trinity? Uh, one who's capable, as we see today of Stilling the Storm. Now, one of the things that's really interesting, uh, that, that drives the way I've organized things today is that, uh, uh, mark is going to literarily present all of this in parallel doublets.

In other words, stories that appear in twos. Uh, so there will be, as we've, there's already been multiple exorcism stories. You know, there, there [00:04:00] are multiple sea crossings, there are multiple wilderness feedings. And, and, uh, and he does that in order to draw our attention, to make sure that we recognize that these things that are in doublets and later on though, but to triplets, uh, that they have significance.

We're not to, to miss the, the symbolic value of those. So today what we get are sea rescue stories. Now there are actually two. See rescue stories that are in these next few chapters, and, and they're very, very similar. Uh, and it seems intentionally. So, uh, what we see is the scary nature of these boundary crossings.

The struggle, uh, they symbolize the struggle. To bridge these deeply alienated worlds of Jew and Gentiles. So as, as you see the Sea of Galilee there before you, you can see it's a, a very large lake. It's a, a lake that, uh, is, uh, 33, I think 33 miles in circumference. If it's wide AST point, it's eight miles across, it's 13 miles long.

So it's an awful lot like our [00:05:00] finger lakes here. Um, but, uh, it, it was prior to Mark, it wasn't ever. As far as we can tell Literarily it wasn't ever named as a C. So Mark, uh, scholars tell, tell us, uh, is the first to name it the C of Galilee. He uses, uh, the word uh, uh, theasa there, the Greek word theasa in place of where was in all the literature we've been able to recover.

Always called a Lake Limby. And today it's called a lake 'cause that's what it is. And that seems to be quite intentional in Mark, uh, Mark's point in connecting it with, as we'll see. The Hebrew scriptures, symbolic language of, of the sea. So we'll come to that. Um, one of the things that we'll be noticing as we go over the next few chapters of the next several weeks is that we're now going to see a tension building.

This is the major plot development in the story that Mark is telling a tension not just between Jesus and these, uh, powers and principalities, but between Jesus and his very [00:06:00] own disciples who, who seem. Not to quite get it, not quite, not, uh, to quite embrace, um, the faith, uh, to which he's calling 'em, that will be essential to their, uh, flourishing in the ministry on which he ascending them.

So today let's, uh, let's dig into, uh, these two sea stories. You see two Steve Rescue stories. We're gonna do that We've read together. One catch occurs. In chapter four at the end of chapter four, the other occurs later in chapter six. As I said, they're, they're very, very similar stories. Before we get into that, I wanna remind you that the Sea of Galilee is in fact a beautiful place, but it's, uh, uh, you see the satellite image here, it's other names, Tiberius and Kinder are the names of, of, of that lake now.

Uh, but you can see it from a satellite imagery. You can see it from, to the far left of this imagery. You can see the Mediterranean Sea. And then you can see in the middle of that this lake. And then, and then the greenery from the satellite imagery is the fertile river valley of the [00:07:00] river Jordan, uh, flowing down about 90 miles down to, uh, Jerusalem and then ultimately into the Dead Sea.

Um, a little bit. Uh, this is just an expanded, uh, view of that so you can really see this area. And what's interesting is to the left, you see the. Fertile plane into the right, you guys, the topograph, topographic, topographically. Geographically you can see, uh, what you, you, you get is a less fertile area, the deserts.

And, and it's interesting, you know, you can see that boundary geographically, but it was also perhaps because of the geography, a boundary. Culturally, because to the, to the east was the, the fertile area that where the tribes of Israel had settled and so it was predominantly Jewish in, in, in that small region there, although completely surrounded by Hellenized.

Cultures, you know, other words, Gentiles, and then, and then, and then to the, to the, uh, east, uh, where, where it's less fertile. Uh, it was [00:08:00] very much, uh, surrounded by not only, not only, um, uh. Uh, the, the, the Gentiles, the, the enemies, historic enemies of the Jews, but the, the Roman Empire, it was the eastern border of the Roman Empire into the, even further east where the empire, the, uh, Roman Empire's enemies and so to the, to the east of the lake.

You see, there was a completely different world, an alien world in terms of other nations, but for the Jews, it was very much a venturing into the world of the Gentile. Um, you can see here on this map, Capernaum, uh, and this is where, there where most of the stories in gospel of Mark take place. This is Jesus's headquarters.

This is where they are often at Peter's home. And, uh, on one of the trips in the second of these, they're going to go to Beth Beth saa. Uh, and that's a journey of, you can look on that map. It's about just crossing. If you took the straightest point, it's still about two miles. Crossing there. Uh, but, [00:09:00] but in one, in the, in the, the first story, they're actually crossing the, to the south, uh, which would've been a journey of about eight miles.

Uh, uh, and this is of course in the midst, midst of a, of, of two mountains in a very low valley. That is, that is very much subject to high winds. And then here's a little, uh, a map that, uh, that helps you see what I'm describing, uh, where you see Galilee. Then if you look and you see Judea to the south, those are Jewish territories.

Uh, in between them as Samaria. Those are the lands that, uh, of, of those fallen cousins, of the Jews as they saw it, uh, those who had, uh, uh. Intermarried with, uh, the Assyrians and the Babylonians and other immigrants and had not made, made, know, maintained the, the same traditions. And so they were seen as, as fallen cousins.

And that was an, you know, that was, uh, uh, an area that was, was not considered Jewish by them. But then the opis, the 10 cities, that was very much gentile territory. I wanna, I wanna, um, make, ask you to look at the Deco and then look on there. You [00:10:00] can see the town of Rasa. We're next week gonna be talking about the ene, uh, demoniac.

Uh, and, uh, that's, uh, the, the town from which, uh, the town that is, that is, that is, uh, engaged there with, with, with that story. The Racine. The Enes came from Rasa. Um, but you can see all of that land there, where the, was the, was gentile territory. So crossing the lake, crossing the lake. Or the, or what Mark calls, as you know, the Sea of Galilee was, was not merely going from one border to the other.

It was crossing into a completely alien world. Uh, it was like, it was like crossing, uh, crossing the tracks, uh, uh, in, you know, in our, uh, in our language in here in the United States. I remember. I remember when I was a little boy, um, how just living in Baton Rouge, uh, we had a woman who worked for us who, who really was, uh, uh, today, we might call her a [00:11:00] nanny.

She took care of us while my mother went to college. And, um, and my, and what I remember is getting in the car, uh, she would ride the bus to our house 'cause she didn't have a car, couldn't afford one. Uh, and then, then in the, at the afternoon after my mother came home, my mother would drive her home. So we'd all pile into our.

Our, uh, little station wagon and drive all the way across Baton Rouge Town. And then as we did that, we would cross the railroad tracks, and as we crossed the railroad tracks, I would enter into a world that was entirely alien to me. You know, we were middle class, upper middle class eventually, but certain, you know, certainly, uh, uh, well off and privileged.

Uh, but as we entered into the land in which, uh, uh, into the area of, of town that was. Where, where Marie lived, uh, I would, I would be going into a world that was completely alien to me. A world that, uh, of houses that were, uh, you know, looked very different from mine, that were all very crowded. And, and, and I, and I would discern that I, that I, this was an area where I didn't feel like I belonged.[00:12:00] 

Uh, it, it was an area that my mother taught me to be nervous about being in. And then, and I would hear that it was an area of high crime. This was the, this was the reality and has been the reality and still is the reality of our segregated cities. And so for the, for crossing the lake. Uh, for, for, for the Jews when Mark's talking about them, you know, going to the other side, it was much like us going to the other side as we crossed railroad tracks in our time going into the world, that was not home for us.

Now, I wanted to make sure I show you a picture here of the boats, because the boat in which there'd be crossing is, uh, a boat's about the size of, uh, one of those, uh, UPS delivery trucks, right? Going across a boat that gets these seas that can get, you know, very, very high. If you've ever been out on the Great Lakes in a storm.

It's, uh, you, you can see it's just like the ocean. Uh, you can get, you know, 20 foot swells out there. And so these boats are with, you know, have very low gunnels. And so as the, as they described, the, the, uh, the, the seas coming [00:13:00] over the gunnels of, of the ship of, of the boat, uh, it's something that, uh, it's very easy for me, uh, to, to imagine, uh, and, and, and the fear that would put in their hearts even though they weren't that far from shore.

I. It's something that I can appreciate. I remember being at sea on my submarine in the North Sea, uh, and if you ever saw the movie Dos Boat, it characterizes very well what it's like. There were some places where the waters were too shallow for us to be submerged, and so we would have to cross on the surface.

And so I remember being in the dark of night. And the seas are so high that they were just crashing over the submarine. It was just myself and my lookout. And, uh, we were up in the sail of the submarine with our binoculars looking, uh, to make sure we didn't run it into any merchant ships or oil rigs and such.

Uh, and, and the, and, and we were in such danger of being washed. Off of our boat into those seas. And so we lashed ourselves to the [00:14:00] sails. And I remember that fear. I remember how, how perilous that was and how relieved I was when my four hour watch would end. So it's easy for us, I think even though these were first great semen, these sailors, you know, Peter, John, James, they, these were fishermen.

We can understand how it would've been scary. For them when these storms, uh, cropped up when we look at the size of boat that they were in. Um, so the, the, we have two journeys here and, uh, I just wanna point out some of the sim similarities, both of these journeys. Actually within this three chapters we're gonna see.

Uh, six sea journeys. They'll cross the, they'll cross what Mark calls the sea, the lake, six times. Two of them though, are detailed by Mark. He mentions the others just in passing. But two of these trips, uh, he describes in great detail, and if you were to, to map them side by side, you'll see the details are so similar that, that mark seems to be, uh, [00:15:00] pointing, you know, encouraging us.

And the first one is that. Uh, I, I mentioned both times that they're very perilous journeys and both times there are journeys in which they're crossing to what Mark calls the other side. And, and, and what I think, uh, mark intends for us to do is understand it's not just the underside, the other side of the lake, it's the other side of humanity, the gentile side.

Um. And, uh, uh, in the first trip trip, uh, what what's happened is Jesus has just finished that pep talk. You know that pep talk with the mustard seed? Uh, and uh, and he says, okay, you guys, I've told you, I've warned you what it's gonna be like, and, and now let's go do it. And so he says, go get in the boat.

And so they all get in the boat and they cross, and now they're gonna go to the other side. Jesus falls asleep. A lot like Jonah, except if you remember from Jonah's story, Jonah, uh, was, was was going in the opposite direction of where God told him to go. He was going the opposite direction from the, the Gentiles at Nineveh, uh, where [00:16:00] God sent him.

He was trying, he was fleeing. Jesus is instead going where God's telling him to go. He's going to the people to call the Jews to be a light to all the nations. And so they're crossing over to the other side and Jesus is. Asleep in the back of the boat and they come to him in the sphere as the seas are crashing over this boat and they say, teacher, don't you care?

We're perishing. And they thereby betray their great fear of abandonment. And then we see in both of the stories, Jesus silences the storm and he also silences their lack of faith. He speaks into that, and, and I don't think we can hear Mark's story without recalling the Psalms and the other places in scripture.

As, as we remember that there was only one person. Who is capable of stilling the seas with their voice. And in scripture that is, uh, the [00:17:00] one that you and I refer to as Father, son, and Holy Spirit, it's the God of, of, uh, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And so we, we remember in the Salter, uh, from, for example, Psalm 1 0 7.

Uh, uh, the, the recollection of the folks who went to see, and it in, in 1 0 7, it talks about they cried to the Lord in their trouble as, as, as the seas, as the waves, uh, you know, uh, overwhelmed them. And he, and, and he brought them out from their distress. He made the storms. Still, and the ways of the seas were hushed.

They were silent. They were silenced. And then in the, we just read in the story from Jonah, uh, in this case, Jonah said, just throw him up for board. So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea, and immediately in the act of, of doing the thing that God desired. Then the seas ceased as, as Jonah stopped running and, and causing that ship to go in the opposite direction.

The sead ceased immediately [00:18:00] from its raging. And then we see in Psalm 1 0 4, uh, just the reminder of, of, um. How, uh, God had set, uh, he was the great creator. This is echoed also in the, in the, in the Book of Job, you set the earth on its foundations so that it shall never be shaken. You are the one who covered it with the deep As with the garment, the waters stood above the mountains and at your rebuke.

Those waters flee. And the word here, uh, that is in the, the Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures rebuke is, is exactly the Greek word that mark uses when he, when he describes what Jesus has done, he rebuked the sea and it was silence. Mark is, has a little bit of Trinitarian logic, uh, in his story here, naming Jesus.

This in fleshed one who was inaugurating the kingdom as, uh. As, as the one who is capable of doing that, which only Yahweh [00:19:00] can do, rebuke the seas and cause them to hush. And then in Psalm 1 0 6, they, there's the recollection of Moses, uh, uh, where, where Moses, uh, rebuked the Red Sea and, and it became dry in order to deliver us.

And so this rebuking of the seas, the waters that, uh, signify for the Jews chaos and disorder. God alone is the one that's able to say peace, be still, and to speak into our experience of chaos, our experience of being abandoned, and to bring about the calm that we need so that we can carry on and actually turn around and go in the right direction.

As Jonah prophet Jonah ultimately did. Of course the center of these stories, both of these, these sea rescue stories, uh, the center of the stories actually is not the sense of abandonment that the disciples feel. And it's really not the [00:20:00] characterization of Jesus as the one who's able to rebuke the seas, but rather.

Center of both of these stories is the disciple's response and, and the, the rebuke that Jesus gives them. He says, do you not yet have faith? I mean, you've seen everything I've done. You already have seen so much. You've heard all of my teaching. We just talked about, uh, this mustard seed faith. Do you not yet have faith?

He says. And you hear them asking an interesting question, who then is this, that even the see and when to listen to them. An exact quote of something else said at the beginning of Mark's gospel except for the objects that have been changed. Who then is this? Who silenced the demons. Do you recall that in chapter one, verse 27, uh, when Jesus did the exorcism in the synagogue?

Now he has the disciples speaking the same words, having [00:21:00] the same sense of wonderment, not understanding what they're seeing, that the crowd and those who were in opposition to Jesus. So Mark is seeing us disciples saying the same thing as the people who don't seem to get Jesus. In all these stories, like the unclean spirit at that synagogue who Jesus exercised, the elements themselves are silenced.

What's interesting is they're silenced because they listen to their, the Jesus's word. They listen to the word, and the big question that arises is, will they listen? Jesus just preached a sermon where he said, listen. To the disciples, listen, this is what it's going to be like. And the question is, will the disciples like the unclean spirits and like the seas who listen to Jesus, will the disciples listen and hear and have eyes to see [00:22:00] all that Jesus is teaching them?

And will we. So the first trip was made under Jesus' protection. The, the second trip is, uh, made with, uh, Jesus, uh, not, you know, telling them on, you know, to, to go on their own. They, they, they are alone in the boat. And Jesus, it says, in, in the gospel, says that Jesus forced the disciples to embark in the boat ahead of him, uh, to the other side.

Their destination with Beth Sida. Uh, in, in that, in that, in that second gospel reading, uh, Jesus stresses or rather Mark stresses three times this sense of being alone in the boat, Jesus wasn't with them it seems. So first it says that he forced them to go. And then it says he left them to pray in the hills, and so we were able to visualize him in the hills and them in the boat.

And then we see, then it talks about Jesus seeing them far out at sea and, and then in spite of him seeing them flailing at the oars against this [00:23:00] fierce wind that seems to just keep rising. Jesus doesn't come to them immediately. He, he instead, he stays with the father and prays. And it's only on the fourth watch of the night, which is the early morning that Jesus, uh, uh, uh, comes to their rescue.

And then we see again this Trinitarian language, um, uh. Uh, where Jesus, it says, was going to pass them by in verse 48, he says Jesus was going to pass them by. Now, it's not saying I don't believe that he was literally gonna just blow past them, but the, the language of passing by that mark is using 'cause again.

From the Hebrew scripture. So we, so we remember the story of Moses when Jesus, uh, would rather, when Moses was going up to Mount Sinai to receive God's instruction, uh, the form of Torah. Uh, you know, God gives him this instruction. Uh, you know, you know, you know, he's saying, how can I view you? How can I look at you?

How can I experience your faith without being. Your your face. How can I see your [00:24:00] face, my Lord, Yahweh, uh, with, with, without, uh, without being destroyed by it. And so God's answer is, you know, there's a place by me, a cleft in the rock and, and, uh, and while my glory passes, I will put you in that cleft and cover you with my hand until I have.

Passed by. So, so the, the sense of passing by is the sense of God drawing near in the way that, uh, both delivers us and protects us. Uh, and so we have that, that echo. Uh, but, uh, there, there's a similar one in, in kings, uh, where, where with the story of Elijah, God passes by. So this notion of passing by is again this theophanous language.

Uh, well, the, the language that Jesus says, uh. To them, he says, uh, it is, I fear not, some of you probably already, uh, recognize the, that that is, uh, you know, sin syntactically, you know, grammatically it's the same. Uh, you know, those are the same words, uh, [00:25:00] that Moses heard when Moses asked, uh, God's name, Yahweh said, I am who I am.

Well, that Greek form. It is, I, uh, is the same Greek in which that, uh, Jesus, you know, Yahweh's statement, I am who I am. Uh, it's the same, uh, translation, exactly the same phrase that we see in the Greek translation of, of Yahweh saying I am. So when Jesus says it is, I, it's Mark is putting those words in Jesus' mouth.

Again, a Trinitarian echo for us. And again, that same word that God always says, fear not. And then again, what we get from the second story is this harsh verdict from Jesus, except now at the, by the time we get to chapter six, it's hard. It's, it's, it's a much harsher word. Uh, he says that your hearts had hardened and they had hardened like Jesus's opponents.

I. The disciples were beginning to be seen as though they were part of the opposition. By, by Jesus. They were getting in the way they were, they were impeding [00:26:00] his work. They don't, and, and it turns out as they were on the second crossing, they don't reach their, their hearts hit hardened, and so they don't reach their destination.

They're supposed to go to bed Sida, but they never actually get across the sea. They never get across the lake. Their fears are too great. Their hearts had hardened. So I think these are very important stories, uh, for us to reflect on our own discipleship, our own journey in, in, into which we are called, um, the, the boundary crossing, uh, to which we are called, uh, and, and, and the reality of how hard that can be, how scary it can be for us to cross into the other side, to cross, uh, to the other side where the other side of humanity lives, people.

Who live, who, who don't have the customs we have, who don't have, uh, the worldview that we have, uh, who don't have, uh, the, the sense of flourishing that we have. I'm reminded of a story, uh, you may recall of a, of a very [00:27:00] famous Episcopalian woman, uh, named Mary Peabody. Um. In 1964, uh, this, this, uh, uh, was a, an incredible woman.

Mary Peabody was, uh, the mother of the governor of Massachusetts in Dicot Peabody. She was the, uh, mother also of the, uh, Bishop of Central New York, the Episcopal Bishop of Central New York, and she was the mother of another Episcopal priest. She was the first cousin of Eleanor Roosevelt. Um, but, uh, she becomes, uh, important in our history.

Uh, when during the Civil Rights Movement, uh, there had been no progress in the, in the city of St. Augustine, St. Augustine, Florida. Uh, in, in, in, as we were building up to the Civil Rights law passage, uh, they, they were, uh. Maintaining their segregation. And then, and, and, uh, they had done all sorts of, of, uh, things from a nonviolent perspective, Martin Luther King's, [00:28:00] uh, team, uh, but, but were not having success.

And they came up with the idea that we needed to Dr. Uh, dramatize, um, and draw attention to symbolically draw attention to what's happening here in the hardheartedness of God's people in Saint Augustine and resist. Uh, this reconciliation of the races to which we are called to, we'd strive to be the beloved community and, uh, and that things weren't working.

And so the idea came that they would, they would go up to New England and invite folks, uh, from Boston, uh, in other areas of New England. Down first as they came down on their spring breaks to Florida, that instead of going to Daytona Beach to stop instead and be a part of the nonviolent movement and resistance against segregation in St.

Augustine. And, uh, and they recognized that they needed to have someone to who, uh, would be noteworthy, uh, who, uh, to who, who would be able to draw attention to this, uh, for the world to see. [00:29:00] And so they recruited, uh, the, they tried to recruit actually first three Episcopal bishops, but each of the three Episcopal male bishops declined, but their wives didn't.

Their wives, uh, each of their wives said, well, uh, uh, uh, you, you, you, you know, you may not go, but I will go. And then the mother of, of, of Endicott Bishop, uh, uh, went as well. One of these was the first one of these women was the wife of the very first black bishop in the Episcopal church, Don John Burgess.

So they made their way down to Augustine. And, uh, what you see here is the church, the Episcopal church at St. Augustine. That's Trinity Episcopal. It was the cathedral there. And the cathedral was, uh, right across from the old slave market in St. Augustine, uh, St. Augustine, where, uh, in the old slave market was the, was the destination of all the nonviolent, uh, protest marches that would happen every single night, and arrests would ensue.

Uh, they'd march to the os slave market from. [00:30:00] The Baptist Church, which was their headquarters, and it was right across the Episcopal Church, but the Episcopal church there didn't wanna get involved. Um, and so we have Mary Peabody, uh, and, and, uh, and, and Ms. Burgess, uh, uh, and a few other women that are there at the.

And, and deciding that they're gonna go have, uh, you know, break and challenge desegregation laws at the PO at the hotel, at the Mo Motor Lodge called nce Leon Motor Lodge. Uh, and so they go there and, uh, they are rebuffed, uh, and the sheriff arrives and, uh, and, and Mary Peabody's assuming that, uh, it was just some persuasive talk, she would be able to persuade them to, uh, allow their other guests to, to eat.

Instead he arrest, uh, all the black. Guests and Mary Peabody isn't arrested. Uh, Esther Burgess Ver was arrested and she was put in the back of the police car, uh, with two German Shepherds in her face, and she was thrown into jail. So you have this situation [00:31:00] where the, uh, the, the black people are suffering and the, and the white folks, including Mary Peabody, uh, were, were not because of their privileged sat status.

The, this was Easter weekend. Uh, Esther decided to go to Easter service, uh, at Trinity Episcopal Church. Cathedral across from a slave market, and she walks there and she discovers that the vestry had voted to cancel Easter services because they did not want to cross to the other side. They didn't want to get drawn into this battle, uh, to, uh, to roll back this, uh, sin of segregation in their own city.

Uh, and the vestry folks even refused to shake her hand. Uh, and, uh, so, so she, she went away. Uh, and as I said, uh, her, her, she recognized and her soul was hurting because she recognized that as her black friends that were suffering and while she was not, and then, uh, and she made a decision, she somehow in [00:32:00] prayer found the courage, uh, to join them.

And so. She called her husband, she called her her son, the governor. She called her son the bishop and said, this is what I'm going to do, deal with it. And uh, and uh, they tried to figure out ways to make her path easy, but before they could do much, she went down and, and went to another, uh, location in San Augustine and got herself arrested by the sheriff was thrown into jail and the result of it was, uh.

Massive publicity throughout the world. This picture, these are the pictures of Mary Peabody and the, and the one on the right there. Uh, the woman in the, the hat on the right, uh, is, uh, Esther Burgess, uh, who was, who went into jail first, and then good old Mary Peabody, who looks a lot with a sweetness. A lot of you have, you see her, uh, in jail here with her, with her, uh.

Pearl ear, a pearl necklace and, uh, and and [00:33:00] such. And, uh, as a result of all of this, Mary crossed the boundaries and made a difference. Uh, didn't change the world instantly, but like a mustard seed. It began to change That led to the desegregation of St. Augustine. Kingdom Construction folks is what we are called about, called to do.

It's what we're about to join Jesus in his ministry of constructing the kingdom of God. And that requires us having the courage, finding the courage to cross boundaries, and we have to cross those boundaries in in order to. Inaugurate these alternative ways of being, which are the way of love, which constitute the old way of love, which threaten the old ways.

And it's scary. Mark's telling us in this story today, I believe it is scary. It feels like chaos at times. It feels like the, that we will be swamped in lost at sea at times, even get arrested perhaps, and thrown into jail. And I think Mark is saying, but [00:34:00] when we know. Who Jesus is, we are not afraid. We hear him saying it is I do not fear.

And so therefore we have no excuse to hold back. We have no excuse to give into our fears when we ourselves are called to do this boundary call crossing. So my hope is that somehow. All of us, uh, here will not think that we are either too old or weak, or, or are, are if we've already done our duty. But we'll figure out now in our own time how we ourselves, in our time at our age, are called to do boundary crossings, to make a difference in making the Kingdom of God and reclaiming kingdom territory in this great land we call America.

I think that's what we're called to do. We just gotta figure out how to get in the boat together. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
