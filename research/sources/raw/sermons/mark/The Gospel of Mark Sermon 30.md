# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 30

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. One point of order. I am trying something new today. I've got a, a dual monitor set up so I can see your faces waving at me. And I mentioned that because a few weeks ago, uh, we had some technical difficulties and some of you tried to signal me. Uh, so today, uh, I am. Able to see you doing that.

And I mentioned that because we're having internet, uh, difficulties accessing today. So I've been bumped off and on. So if that happens, if you aren't able to hear me, you can go ahead and give me a signal and we'll figure out what to do about that. So with that word of order, let's jump into our gospel lesson today.

A very familiar one. This is one that we read every year. Um, as part of our, um, Palm Sunday and Passion Sunday leader, uh, liturgies. So very familiar to you, but we've never actually done a a, a study on this. Uh, so we're gonna continue today in our close reading on the Gospel of Mark once again, trying to [00:01:00] read Mark.

As the artist that Mark, uh, is and understanding his text literarily, uh, in the sense of, of the art, uh, that it is. And, uh, and we will, uh, dive right into the story. In order to, to jump into it, I wanted to just, uh, share some angst with you that, uh. My wife and I have been feeling, and I imagine you have been feeling, we've spoken about this a bit, but it, uh, really has been uppermost of my mind this week as I've act, I've, as I've engaged this text, one of the, one of the, um.

Challenges I've had in this, in this, you know, and engaging this brief story all week is just to understand, well, how is this story the good news for us? I mean, we know where it's headed, right? We know that it's headed to, uh, from, you know, from this Palm Sunday type story, the way we're, we're familiar with, uh, you know, in, in, in encountering.

It, uh, to the Good Friday story. That's not so much, [00:02:00] uh, a celebration, uh, as, uh, you know, full of hosannas as, as this story is today. Um, how is, how does it speak to our situation? And one of the things that, uh, uh, I have, I have been thinking about is just how extraordinary time we are living in, um. As you know, INE is a clinician and, uh, and she comes home and, and, and, and is often just, you know, uh, exhausted just by the, the challenge of working with patients that are, um.

Much more anxious than normal and acting out in their anxiety mu at a, to a much higher degree than normal. And we've spoken a lot between us about, uh, uh, a surprising incivility, a lack of respect that we Americans have begun to show. Each other. And I, I wanna suggest to you that we are encountering right now, we're living in not just a pandemic, [00:03:00] but also what I wanna call an epidemic.

An epidemic, uh, of, of loss, of control, an epidemic of anxiety, an epidemic in which we are. Acting out too often in, in, in civil uncivil ways. And, uh, and, and even worse than that in rageful ways. And of course this is an image from our insurrection on January 6th, and we've spoken an awful lot about that.

Uh, but, but if we just go back to that as sort of a, a, a, uh, moment that was pivotal in our time. What led to that moment? Now we are, our congress is acting, you know, in its role to investigate, you know, what. What caused it. But what I'm really asking is what could possibly have happened to our country, uh, that would've led folks, uh, to feel such anger, such unrest, such anxiety that they would feel called to assault the capital of.

The country. [00:04:00] Um, and, uh, and, and I, I, I, you know, don't wanna suggest that it's just those who are acting in a political way, acting out in their politics. Uh, although these days it's very difficult for us to separate our personal lives from what we would characterize as our national and local politics. I put some images up there before.

You have some stories that have, have filled our news just in the last several months. In your upper right hand corner, you see the picture. Uh, this is something I grabbed from a video I grabbed from a video, uh, that was taken by a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight. I believe it was Southwest Airlines.

Uh, but, but nonetheless, I won an on an American flight. Uh, and, and the flight attendant, you can see is bloodied there. And, and, uh, and just to the left, you can see the hand of the woman who assaulted her. She was ultimately, uh, uh, arrested. The flight attendant, uh, had two of her teeth damaged. The. Uh, the, the passenger was angry about having to wear a mask and, and, and such on the plane.

And, uh, [00:05:00] when the flight attendant told her to buckle up and put her mask on for the teenth time, uh, the passenger assaulted her, hit her. And, uh, you see the marshal or some, some loyal citizen, someone there, uh, trying to assist in that matter. And then, and below that, down near, near the town of Nashville, the city of Nashville, in Tennessee.

We have another situation. This was, uh, you know, just one of our normal civic liturgies, you know, the meeting of a school board together to plan, uh, the, you know, what will happen in the, in the school district of their town. I. And there you saw, uh, in, in this picture, there is a school board member in that car being assaulted by citizenry who are angry.

Very, very, very angry. And this is just unheard of, uh, in our lives. Uh, not unheard of in various parts of American history. In our lives, this kind of incivility, uh, has been very rare, [00:06:00] uh, in, in the, in the chronic sense that we've been experiencing the last few years. On the left hand side, you see a similar type, uh, image from, uh, a story where a woman was murdered at a grocery store, shopping at a grocery store.

And, uh, the, she required that the man wear a mask and he shot and killed her. Uh, and it, and it wasn't hard for me to find stories like this. They are countless, in fact, just looking up rage stories at supermarkets. So you'll find that that's happening in not just Florida, where that one was, but in rather Georgia, where that one was.

In Michigan and other places. So I, I, I just use these as examples to point to a larger problem. And that is that somehow we've become a nation filled with such anxiety and such anger and tension, and there's a sense that, uh, that, that I perceive of us feeling lost and, and wanting someone. To help us, uh, get out of this situation, wanting to get to some [00:07:00] new point, you know, some still waters in our lives as a people.

And perhaps this is also true in your own personal stories, perhaps your story, you've experienced some of these types of encounters. One, one common one is the division between family members where one family member. Refuses to give, to wear a mask or get vaccinated, and then thereby infects the children and the, and the other adults of, of their family.

And that then creates persistent division. Um, and perhaps in other ways of your life you're experiencing, um, these types of things. So I, I've, uh, I've, I've mentioned several of these. Well, one that I, I have to. You mentioned again, I, I shared with you the story of the, of the, you know, the, basically a riot at a T-ball game.

You know, I didn't know there was such a thing as a T-Ball championship, but evidently there is a city championship for T-Ball somewhere in the state of Tennessee, and there's a video that went viral of the, of the rage. Uh, that, that, uh, led to a, you know, basically a riot on the baseball [00:08:00] field by, by the adults, not by the kids, by the adults, over a call, by one of the umpires.

And so, uh, all sorts of situations I think, that are symptomatic of this. Angst that we are feeling. And I, and, and I, I provide that all, uh, as a way of pointing to, pointing to, uh, the question that I think rises up in our souls. You know, who will deliver us? Now, I could have pointed to other things. This is the, you know, the COVID related, uh, and.

And, um, politically related, uh, division that I'm, I'm speaking of. Um, but I, I could have similarly pointed to, you know, uh, statistics in our crime rate, you know, that have been published recently. You know, that we've seen a spike in the last 18 months in crimes of violence. And so from all of these things and others, I, I think that we find ourselves in a situation all too often where we ask this question, who will deliver this?

And I wanna remind you, this is not a new question. Question for us humans to ask. This is, [00:09:00] this is one of those existential questions that we come to again and again, and I wanna remind us if this is a question that had arisen in Israel, uh, certainly when Jesus was, uh, on the scene, uh, alive, walking on the planet Earth.

But also, and, and perhaps more importantly in our story today. During the time in which Mark wrote and shared his gospel. So I've shared some of that context with you, but I wanna remind you that in 66 ad, you know, a generation after Jesus had been crucified there, uh, the, the Jews revolted against Rome.

Tweaked, you know, the battalion there, the, the, the, uh, that, that was, that was guarding, you know, the, you know, the garrison that was there at Caesarea. And, uh, and, and they were, you know, waiting, you know what ultimately was the complete destruction and, um, exile of the leaders. Uh, who survived from Jerusalem.

So we've talked about that multiple times. That's the context. But markets writing [00:10:00] in between those two times a time where the people were anticipating great, great destruction and perhaps the inability to survive. And I think that's very important to understanding our story today. That, that mark. Is, uh, sharing with us because one of the things that happens when we are seeking and feeling a, a need for deliverance here now, Lord, hear my prayer, and now Lord, deliver me, deliver us.

When, when, when those things rise up from our souls, one of the things that happens is that we become vulnerable to following the wrong people. We become vulnerable to hearing the sirens that would lead us into the rocks. We become vulnerable to following. What I want to call false messiahs. Uh, and, and the, and the nature of the claim of such folks and their opportun uh, their opportunistic narcissistic personalities very often, uh, would be that basically, Hey, believe my account of events, believe my account of [00:11:00] what's happening on believe.

Let my word be true for you. And if you promise that type of fealty, if you promise that type of fidelity to my way of being. Then I will conquer your foes for you. And that's the Messianic claim. And it's something that, uh, folks with Messianic pretensions often, uh, say in, in various ways. And this was something that happens, uh, you know, quite a lot through history.

It's something that happened in, in, uh, in, in our lifetime. And. And my purpose today is not to go into all of the, the, the false messiahs that arise here in America at times, but to think about the false messiahs briefly, uh, that arose before the fall of Jerusalem. And I, uh, and I I, I just wanna mention that important question when we're asking who will deliver us, is to ask the follow up question.

Well, how will we recognize leaders who are worth following? How do we recognize the right ones? 'cause [00:12:00] we have the possibility. Of following and, and, and, uh, and following just anybody who might lead us over a cliff. Um, so how do we know? And I wanna remind you that, you know, in a nutshell, Jesus has just told us in chapter 10 of our gospel, so 15 verses back, he's given us some very clear guidance on this, where he says, whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant.

That's how we'll recognize it. They will be our servants, not our lords, whoever wants to be first among you. Will be the slave of all for the human one didn't come to be served, but rather to serve and to give his life to many people. So I mentioned that because in our gospel lesson today, I don't want you to pass over this very first verse, uh, which is, uh, uh, where Mark's giving us a little bit of.

Um, a little bit of a, a, a, uh, setting, um, of, of what is happening. Um, [00:13:00] you know, and, and as Jesus begins and continues his, his journey to Jerusalem, it says that when Jesus and his followers approach Jerusalem, they came to. Beth Phage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives. Now this is actually, uh, something that is, uh, important data.

First of all, I want you to know who this is in the cross. We're used to Palm Sunday, and I don't know about you, but I always thought that the people coming out to greet Jesus where the citizens of Jerusalem, but that's not actually. What the Greek says in our translation from the common English Bible, uh, it makes it pretty clear it's Jesus and his followers.

In other words, those he had been picking up who had been following him, uh, throughout Galilee had come down with him. And that crowd got larger and larger and larger. And so we're not even in Jerusalem yet, as I always thought. We are, uh, down the mountain from Jerusalem, ascending the mountain. So we're in a little, you know, burb if you will.

Of Jerusalem and, uh, his Jesus and his [00:14:00] followers were on the approach. And Jesus, mark tells us, entered through the Mount of Olives. Now, why is that significant? Well, the Mount of Olives is, uh, a very significant place biblically and his historically for the Jews. Now the normal way for someone who is going to enter as a king into Jerusalem.

Is not through the amount of olives from the north, but from the west coming from Caesarea. The Roman centurions would, would ride on horseback with their flags flying and enter through the city gates. That's the normal way someone of prestige enters into the city of Jerusalem. And in most cities in ancient time, you come through the city gates, but, but Jesus is basically coming through the back door.

He is coming through the Mount of Olives, which is about 400 feet. Uh, uh, below Jerusalem in terms of elevation and, uh, you know, a few miles out. And if the more important thing biblically was that it was the place that, uh, Zechariah in the [00:15:00] reading that Steve SKUs read to us so well today, uh, where the final battle of, of the Messiah would happen, where the Messiah would begin and, and, and begin his, his battle, uh, in which the, the Zechariah would, would conquer Israel's.

Enemies. And so the Mount of Olives is, uh, you know, evokes immediately, uh, this idea of the Messiah's arrival on the day of the Lord based on the prophets. Uh, and, and it also is, is important that, uh, the, the, the, the data that, uh, mark gives us about how Jesus arrives on a donkey, on a colt, uh, uh, for, for two reasons that I wanna share with you from history.

First of all, uh, you know, you, you're, you're familiar with, uh, you know, Hanukkah and the, and the celebration of lights, uh, that is part of the Jewish tradition that comes from the time of the Maccabees. Uh, and Simon Simon Maccabees about two years before this time [00:16:00] when Jesus is, is, uh, uh, arriving at Jerusalem.

Um, defeated the Antiochus epiphanies. Antiochus epiphanies was the Greek general, if you recall. That is the, is the cause of our book of Daniel. He is the one who profaned the temple. He's the one who slaughtered a pig in the temple and forced. The Jews to, um, worship the Greek gods and to, uh, do, uh, um, profane things in the temple, uh, and, and made it almost illegal to practice Judaism.

And so, uh, Simon Maccabeus, uh, formed, uh, is the one who, uh. Who created a Jewish army and, and gathered them, entered in Jerusalem like a king. And then after defeating the Greek general, uh, entered into Jerusalem with the flags flying with on horseback just like a king and in fact established. His kingship.[00:17:00] 

Uh, and then he, one of the things he did is he went and cleansed, literally cleansed to the temple, and then he rebuilt the temple. Uh, began that project that Herod the Great would ultimately finish. Uh, so there was, there was a historical precedent here of how a king enters to deliver. Jesus. A lot of folks thought of the Maccabees, uh, as something of a Messianic group, but more importantly, in Mark's time, right about the time Mark was writing right during the Jewish revolt, there was a a, a Messianic, uh, pretender.

I. He was, he led the saris. The saris were the, uh, were the group, uh, I've mentioned to you before, who were the assassins, uh, who ended up assassinating all of the sady leaders, all of the elite of, of Jew, of, uh, elite Jews who had been lording over the people taking their land, consolidating it, throwing them off, uh, and into serfdom.

Uh, well, uh, mana, uh, [00:18:00] uh, rose up after that Jewish revolt took a band of people and they broke in. They went out to Masada in the desert, Fort Masada, and they, uh, broke into the Roman Armory there and, and armed themselves. And then he similarly to Maccabeus, uh, injured into Jerusalem flags flying with his group.

Declared himself the leader of the Jews, and then began, uh, organizing the siege that was ongoing. As Mark is writing now, again, he entered in glory in, in Marshall Glory. So notice the contrast here. So Jesus is entering not through the city gates like a triumphant warrior King. But on a donkey through the, through the Mount of Olives, where the, where Zechariah had told us the true Messiah would come.

And so that's what we see here. Jesus gave two disciples a task saying them go into the village. You're gonna find a cult There. A cult, uh, [00:19:00] it actually, uh, in, in context, uh, in, in the other gospels, they, they name it as a. Donkey. Um, and, and there's this interesting code language, un tie it and, and, and bring it here.

If anyone says to you why you're doing this, say, if it's master needs it. Now, the speculation is not that there is magic here, that this person is just gonna, you know, magically, you know, know that Oh. You know, someone comes and asks you for a cult, give it to 'em. 'cause that's what happens here. The owner gives it to them.

Uh, but rather that this was a prearranged thing. 'cause we know that from the gospel of John, John chapter 11 and 12, that Jesus spent an awful lot of time at Bethany. He was, that's where Marian Martha were. And so he was probably well known to the community and arranged, uh, arranged in the, in the pilgrimage where you know, that he would stay.

And, uh, with, with his disciples as he, as he, as he prepared for Passover, and he probably had arranged this, and so he gave this code language, say his master needs it and he will send it back right away. That's the, that's the scholarly [00:20:00] speculation that is, is most commonly offered to explain what happened there.

So they brought the cult to Jesus and look what they did. They didn't do, uh, something that you and I would do if we saw a political leader. Uh, they, they threw their clothes upon it. So the, so, so they made a saddle for Jesus out of their clothes, and he did something he never does. He, he rode. Into Jerusalem, uh, rather than walk into Jerusalem.

And it says that many people spread out their clothes on the road while others spread branches that were cut from the field. So we always think of palms and palm Sunday. There are no palms in, in and around Jerusalem. So, uh, we translate that into palm, that word into palms often. But these would've been branches cut from the crops, corn and the like, uh, that that would be growing in the, in the fields, uh, surrounding.

Um, Jerusalem. So one of the things that's interesting is nowhere else do we see Jesus, [00:21:00] you know, riding any sort of animal. Jesus has al heretofore always been on foot, and so it's quite interesting that Jesus very intentionally said that I will now I. I will now ride on, uh, on an animal, in this case, not, not a majestic horse, but a very humble being, a donkey.

Um, and, and this is important in terms of the contrast that he's setting because you're not supposed to, you know, I. Ride horses or any sort of animals. If you're a pilgrim coming from afar for the Passover, you know, the, all the other folks around Jesus would have been walking because that was what was the expected norm, uh, for pilgrims at, you know, during the Holy Week.

You know, they would, they would walk together and join as they got reached, the pathways, and they would decorate the horns of their cows and the horns of their, and then the necks of their, of the sheep that they were bringing for, for. Sacrificed and they would sing psalms together [00:22:00] and they would all walk together, much like we were walking in a parade, right?

And so in the midst of all these pilgrims that are, that are getting larger and larger, the close in numbers, the closer they get to Jerusalem, Jesus mounts. And so very much what I would characterize as street theater here, uh, by Jesus, uh, uh, some, you know, very intentionally invoking the prophet Isaiah's prediction of, of what the Messiah would do.

And so what I wanna suggest to you here is what we see here is Jesus for the first time, you know earlier when others would say, you are the Messiah, Jesus says, shh. Don't say that, you know, don't let other people know. Now, Jesus himself is coming out of the closet and he's naming himself the Messiah, uh, through symbolic action.

And, uh, and I, and I want you to understand this, visualize it geographically, um, he is. He is, you know, ascending the mount of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said would [00:23:00] happen. You know, he was sending the amount of the Lord to teach and all the nations would stream to the Mount of the Lord when, when the Messiah came.

And so that's what you see Jesus doing out here. So to help you visualize this, understand Jericho, where Jesus was just prior is the lowest point. On Earth. It's 800 feet below sea level, and that's where Jesus was when he had the, when he met Bartimaeus, just we spoke about that last week, and now he is going to ascend the mount of Jerusalem that is about 3000 feet above sea level.

So roughly 3,500 to 4,000 feet, you know, of a walk. So if you ever hiked a mountain of say, in the Smoky Mountains, you know, it would be like that. So the walk he's done is like us walking from, uh, Webster to Canandaigua or to Bristol and hiking Bristol Mountain, except double the height of Bristol Mountain.

And, and imagine them ascending. That that's what we see Jesus do and these people doing [00:24:00] as Jesus. As they, Jesus leads this parade on his donkey, and that's where we see this phrase, those in front of him saying, Hosanna blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord. He's, they're quoting Psalm one 18, which was, which were the words that they did to, uh, did traditionally going back to the Psalms, that was when, when the king arrived, that was the way they would greet a king or a great teacher.

Uh, the word hosanna, uh, means save us now. But by Jesus' time, it was just a traditional, those were the traditional words of welcome. One gave to a great leader as they arrived. Um, and so after all of this great parade, the parade's over and I wanna make sure we get the, I. Anticlimactic drama here. It's, it's, I think, you know, mark, uh, really wants us to feel the ooh, because he, he set up all this drama of the Messiah arriving, and then he has this one, this last verse in our [00:25:00] story where he says, okay, then, so Jesus, you know, he got to the top of the mountain, he arrived in Jerusalem, and then he went to the temple.

What did he do? He did not much. He just sort of looked around and then he descended. He went back down to Bethany with the 12. In other words, he didn't go and do what the false Messiahs had done at that moment. He arrived, but he arrived in a very nonviolent way. So what are we to make of this? Well, I, I just want to.

Um, to, to, to, um, you know, draw together a few points on this. And the first thing I would say to you, and I think this is really important to us, as we consider and we ask the question, who will deliver us to, to, to just name the reality, what we learned from history, what we learned from. The prayer from the promises of God is that God will hear our prayers.

God does hear our prayers. Even when we feel alone, the fact that we [00:26:00] don't hear God responding does not mean that God does not hear our prayers. God hears our prayers, and God's very nature is to act, to deliver us. And so if you're in a space today feeling. Isolated alone. Feeling rage, feeling ant and and lifting at prayers and feeling as though no one is hearing.

Well understand. The good news is that God, God's very nature is to hear our prayers and to respond. God is a responsible God and God responds, and I'm gonna use the Trinitarian language here. The Father acts through the Son and the Spirit, uh, to. To bring about the good that God desires for each of us.

And so, uh, God then guides us on how to get on the way of love. And helps us and sustains us along the way of love so that God brings about [00:27:00] the reconciled fellowship. That is the very yearning of our hearts. It's the, it's the, it's the thing that we're starving for. Even when it feels like other things may be the very, at the very base of, of our being, the most fundamental hunger that we have is to be at one.

With God and each other, and that's what God is doing. That's what our story is telling us. And I think the other part of this is that God does, that delivers us in wholly unexpected ways. You know, we tend to like, uh, like the disciples themselves, you know, look for, you know, those will deliver us on, you know, in a marshal way, you know, you know, on.

White steeds looking like George Washington curing the sword and using it, uh, with, with great, uh, skill in order to, you know, behead those who challenge us, those who, uh, Lord over us. And that's what we may actually pray [00:28:00] for. But when God responds, it's very rarely that way. 'cause God isn't seeking. Uh, to, to, uh, to destroy, but to create, to create and recreate us as our prayers today say.

And so, God, we should look for God to, to provide the deliverance for which we pray in ways that we can't imagine we should be, uh, surprised if we, if we ever see God delivering us in the way that we predict it, for God delivers us. Uh, as we see today in our story when God delivers, and, and this gets to how we, we, uh, recognize leaders that we should follow.

You know, Jesus aro arrived into Jerusalem as a servant, as a slave, as one who had been down in, in, in wash our feet. That's how we recognize him. That's the very nature of the true leaders that that God provides. If we want to look for a [00:29:00] godly leader, that's how we'll be able to tell. And moreover, that servant leader commands us, invites us.

Helps us to participate in our deliverance by being servant leaders ourselves. So that is our calling and it is our means of grace as well. And brothers and sisters, I think that's this, that's our good news on this 19th Sunday after Pentecost. Lord hears our prayers. They, he, uh, responds to our prayers in ways that we can't anticipate, but it always looks like this being the least among the greatest.

That is in fact how we recognize those who will be the greatest among us. Acted out in our street theater story today. In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
