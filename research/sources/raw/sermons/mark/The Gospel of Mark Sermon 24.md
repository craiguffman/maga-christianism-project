# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 24

[00:00:00] Today we want to continue in our, our, uh. Reading through the Gospel of Mark, and we have a story today that's, uh, quite unusual, uh, story about, um, Jesus, as we said last week, crossing to the other side. And if you remember last week we talked about. Uh, how Jesus and the disciples crossed the, what mark called the Sea of Galilee.

And they were afraid. And he calmed the seas. Instilled the seas, but the, the, the, the journey was to this other side, this other side of humanity. We, and I emphasized then that where they were going was, uh, the other side for them because it was an area of inhabited. Uh, by Gentiles, people who live in a completely different way, uh, different sets of customs and cultures, uh, very much hellenized, uh, folks, former, uh, ancestors or rather cousins of theirs and, you know, in sense of bloodline, who had adopted ways that [00:01:00] were alien to their Jewish ways.

Uh, and so that's where we begin our story today. And this is a, a familiar story, uh, to you. I know you've heard it many times. This is the. This is, uh, one of the most detailed stories that Mark gives us in all these details, I think are quite significant. I want to present you with a, a reading today that, uh, I would characterize as a figurative, uh, reading.

It's, uh, a common reading of this text that, uh, you know, from medieval and actually earlier times, we don't hear that often, but I think, uh, is, uh. One that makes sense of all the details and pays attention to all the details that Mark's Mark provides us. In order to understand what Mark is actually saying, I wanna remind you the context of Mark's gospel is engagement with the Roman Empire.

If you recall, when we began our gospel, um, our, our, our study of this gospel, uh, I, we, we spend some time talking about the fact that Mark is writing to an audience that is, um, uh, [00:02:00] themselves. Traumatized by, uh, the Jewish, uh, civil War and the Jewish Rebellion against Rome. And they are anticipating that the destruction of Palestine, of of, of Jewish Jerusalem, which does come to fore.

Uh, and, uh, and so all of that is in, uh. Very much in the minds and in filling the, the minds of, uh, of the people of Palestine with anxiety. Uh, but, but so too, uh, was that true of Mark's audience in, in Rome where, uh, there were pilgrims against the Jews happening within the city? Uh, and, and so. Uh, Christ, Christ followers, uh, you know, in the era of the late sixties, were very much under pressure from the Roman Empire.

So that's sort of the background context. So I wanna talk today and in understanding, uh, this gospel, uh, really in, in the form of three showdowns that we see. Uh, and, and the first showdown begins, uh, as I'm gonna. [00:03:00] Describe it at least. Uh, I want to draw attention to the one that, that Charlie introduced us to, uh, in his reading of Second Maccabees.

I recognize that second Maccabees is not a book that you guys, uh, read from often, and I noticed from Charlie's face that he found the, the reading particularly uplifting when his little smile. That's a very. Hard, uh, thing to read. Uh, but what you're seeing there is something written. Uh, the second McAfee is a book written in the period, uh, one around 1 67 bc.

So if you think about the time between us and our Civil War, you think about Jesus' time and you, you know, for them the memory of this event that happened, uh, under, uh. Under the Greek, uh, generals, uh, that were dividing the world, the western world tome, and the so seeds, uh, they, they, they, uh, they, uh, conquered, uh, Palestine.

And, uh, and, and so this is recorded history that, uh, we see not just in, in the, uh, writings of the Jews, but in historical documents that were written at [00:04:00] the time of, of, of what happened, uh, in the temple. This, uh, this profaning of the temple where they actually brought pigs into the temple and sacrificed them on the altar.

Now, if you know, uh, much about, uh, Judaism, you know that pigs are considered because of Leviticus, uh, an animal that is unclean, uh, not to be eaten, not to be touched. Uh, and, uh, and, and so this is, was a great and very intentional pro of the, the temple as a, as a strategy. Subordinating it to, uh, the, the, the worldview of, of the Greeks at the time.

And then one of the things that arose from that, of course, were the Maccabees who were able to throw off that domination temporarily and that, and they, that gives us Hanukkah and all these other Jewish celebrations. So there was a period where this strong man was unbound. So that's the context now. So today we're, I want to just remind us, we've been tracking here to four, uh, an internal struggle.

Jesus'. [00:05:00] Repudiation of, of, uh, other ways of being God's people. Uh, and, and primarily what we've seen is his, his taking on his repudiation of the scribal worldview. So you have what we call what I've characterized as an internal family dispute. You know, you know, Jews, speaking to Jews about how we are to fulfill Torah.

And so we've seen those stories where, where Jesus has reminded again and again, describes that. That the Sabbath was made for man, not man, and for the Sabbath. And so pressing a, a worldview, this prophetic worldview that, that, that, that caused, uh, that, that called us and called all the Jews to, uh, a, a very compassionate, um, and, uh, loving, um.

Fellowship with one's neighbor, that, that understood the intent of the law and, and figured out what it was, what was necessary to fulfill that law in the moment. And [00:06:00] so that was Jesus's internal struggle. Today we're pivoting to an external struggle where Jesus, uh, is now engaging for the first time in Mark's account.

Uh, the, the struggle between, uh, the kingdom that he's proclaiming and the one that is the dominant world order. That, uh, Greco-Roman worldview, uh, that was uh, uh, was the worldview of all of the Roman Empire, uh, for the most part, except in little pockets where you had, uh, um, you know, for example, the Jewish people who were allowed to, to worship in their temple, but still were surrounded by this.

Uh, folks who lived in these ways. And so Jesus is crossing the Sea of Galilee and he's down, going down for the first time, and he will be repudiating, uh, in, in the rest of Mark's gospel, these Greco Roman, this Greco-Roman worldview, in addition to that scribal worldview. So what is that? Um, that worldview.

Well, the thing that I'd like for us to point out, and I've mentioned to us several times [00:07:00] before is, uh, one of the principle symbols of, of Rome was the P Romana, the Peace of Rome. And, uh, there were certain things that were just givens. You know, if you. If you talked about who was the son of the most high, that language was the son, you know, that language was attributed to Caesar Augustus.

And then, uh, shortly it would be to Caesar Visian. Uh, the general who was, was, uh, actually bringing his armies in the sixties to attack, uh, Palestine for their, uh, rejection of. Of the payment of tribute to Rome for maintaining the peace. Uh, and so justice in, in the Greco Roman mind was something that was defined by Romans, uh, Rome's Law, uh, which was not democratically discerned at this time, the Roman Senate.

Its had been dissolved and it was Caesar's decree. Uh, and so, you know, if you wanted to know what justice is, all you had to do was look at the content of the law. And, and [00:08:00] justice by definition was what the law said. And, uh, included in that therefore, was an ordering of the world, an ordering of the world, uh, throughout the Roman Empire in a hierarchical way, as you we've discussed many times, it put, uh, all males, you know, uh, at, at various levels, you know, in, in the form of a cast.

And at the very bottom of that cast, you would find women. But, uh, just above women would be slaves, and then all the way at the top would be Roman citizens. And so there was this very rigid, hierarchical ordering of space and of time and of humans, uh, that was, was part of the Roman worldview. Uh, and, uh, and, and the other crucial.

Points of this were that, uh, when, you know, everyone desires peace, everyone wants to have, uh, assurance that they're, that they will be able to continue living, which we would call salvation. And the understanding of this worldview was peace was something that is GI is a gift from Caesar. Peace is peace was was, uh, the [00:09:00] piece of seizure.

And, and it was a piece that he guaranteed by his legions. And I've shared with you this, this idea. Of the Temple of Peace, and I'll show you an example of that shortly. So what we see is this, uh, from second McAfee, you know, that, uh, uh, the predecessor to Caesar, you know, they'd had centuries of this oppression.

And, and there's this, this very civil war like, uh, recollection of the pro of the temple when the king, uh, sent the general and he defiled the temple and named it after the Greek pantheon. And, uh, and then, and, and, and then, and then. Uh, required that the, the Jews eat things that were considered unc unclean.

That's a context I'm trying to suggest to you of the second showdown that we're about to see. Um, but, uh, all of that in terms of things that defile, they have things that defile, 'cause they're physical things like pigs, and they are things that defile because they are. Worldview [00:10:00] views and thoughts that, uh, contradict God's word and God's instructions on how we are to live in, in holy friendship with each other and how we're to live in holy friendship with God and, and the, and the defiling worldview from Rome that I.

I, uh, point to again and again because it is so germane to our own time, is this Roman worldview that understood, uh, peace as something that was, um, brought to us by violence, uh, maintained by violence. And so this is a picture of the. Of the, uh, you know, modern Day Temple of Peace that was built by Ian after he had conquered the masses, the after the Jewish Civil War.

Uh, and, uh, and it's, it's in, this is a, a rendition of what they thought that those, those, uh, those. You know what it actually looked like that temple. But what's really interesting is we were to look at it very closely that this, you know, archeologists have, have told us that throughout this temple is decorated, uh, the Temple of Peace is [00:11:00] decorated with the armaments of war, uh, and signifying the Roman understanding of this connection between power and Roman power and Roman power as the, the thing that provides Roman ability to do violence.

Uh, Roman. Power's ability to enforce the law. Uh, and, and so, uh, this was, uh, the mindset that, uh, was imposed throughout the Greco-Roman world and, and came into sharp contrast with, uh, the, the world, the Jewish, uh, folks had pursued for centuries. Uh, and certainly in contrast with the kingdom that Jesus was proclaiming.

And that leads to our second showdown, which we see in our gospel text today. Uh, and this, what I'm trying to suggest to you in our figurative. Reading of this, that the, the, the, the, the what Mark intends for his audience to understand and I think for us to understand in our own time, uh, is that we see here Jesus, uh, taking on that ex external.[00:12:00] 

Um, struggle and that this story of, of this exorcism, of the demoniac is a story in which we see Jesus, uh, you know, uh, taking, you know, establishing a beachhead, uh, in, in the battle that'll ultimately, uh, take his, uh, his, his followers all the way to the center of the world, which was Rome. So I wanna remind you, uh, the, the, when they crossed to the other side, they crossed to an area called, uh, you know, to the area that, that, uh, was called raa or, or, or esa.

Uh, the Greek is not, is not quite clear, but clearly we know that they crossed to a place, uh, on the other side. And we know that there is actually a. Deep embankment, uh, that fits the description of where this, where this, uh, story about the pigs takes place. So it's, you know, that his listeners could imagine.

And we also know that where they crossed to was the city of the Deis. The 10 cities, 10 cities that were, had, had, uh, created an alliance, a [00:13:00] defense alliance, a military alliance, uh, together. Uh, uh, to, to be as they were an outpost. Uh, to the east of them was Rome's enemies. They were the frontier of Rome, the eastern frontier of Rome.

Uh, and so very much a Hellenistic, uh, empire. So we get the story that, that mark accounts. And so Jesus, as soon as now he got out of the boat, he encounters this man. And, and, and if you recall, we, if we go back to the story of the temple, we see this. Uh, you know, something very similar in, in the, in the beginning of Mark's gospel, we saw, uh, when Jesus was engaging the internal, uh, struggle with the, with this, with the, uh, uh, scribes.

Uh, you know, the, the evil spirit is in the man in the synagogue. Now he's in the man in Gentile territory, and we see all sorts of signs of, of the unc cleanliness of it. In here, there's of course the story about the pigs, but we also see that this man is possessed by an evil spirit. Who came and the man came out of the tombs.

The man was living among the tombs. And as you, [00:14:00] as we've discussed a few weeks ago, and the tombs in, in, in, in touching anything dead renders, uh, one unclean to even contact for Jesus to even come in contact with this man would render Jesus unclean. And this man was. Living among the tombs. Um, and it talks about the evil spirit that animated him, that possessed him, was so great so that he had something like a superhuman strength was strong enough.

Uh, no one was ever strong enough to restrain him even with change. I want you to imagine, uh, someone so possessed by some external spirit that, that, that, uh, that they were. Unable to be constrained and to, to, to live in normal ways such that if, as the story tells, uh, he would actually defile himself, cut himself with stones and, and such and, and, uh, behaviors that we, we, uh, actually see today by folks possessed, uh, as well.

Uh, he, he, he, uh. He, he had been secured many [00:15:00] times. I wanna emphasize that. Many times he'd been secured, but each time he was secure, each time he was, he, you know, this strong man was secured. He had broken out from the chains and, uh, and, and continued and, you know, to, to be uncontrollable. And so night and day in the tombs, uh, he would, he would howl and, and he'd cut himself with stones.

So I wanted to. Focus on that a little bit. We're gonna come back to it in this figurative reading, uh, and understand it in a little bit. But, but, uh, and then this, this, this spirit said to Jesus, uh, who had already commanded him, uh, Jesus, Jesus said, unclean spirit come out of the man. And then the man said, what is your name?

And we've spoken about this, you know, whenever, uh, the, the, these spirits. So these, these demonic spirits, uh, speak to Jesus. They always do this power move. Um. And, and try to name Jesus. And so, uh, Jesus in this case reverses that and, and, and, and says, what is your name? And, uh, and we have [00:16:00] this very interesting response.

The, the, the Spirit responds. Legion is by name because we are many. We are many. So there was not, this was a man who was not possessed by a spirit by, but by many spirits. In the, now we have the plural form, then these many spirits who were in this one man pleaded with Jesus not to send them out. Of the region not to send them out of this region of the gentile world that they were dominating in their uncleanness.

And then we see this wonderful, uh, story about a herd of pigs who were feeding on the hillside and Jesus, uh. Hear them say, send us into the pigs. And Jesus gives them permission to leave his presence and go into the pigs. And so these unclean spirits, uh, left The man went into the pigs and then they rushed, they actually marched down the cliff into the lake and drowned.

So that's the [00:17:00] story that we've just heard. Um, we, uh, did see what happens after it. That, that, that remarkable event, uh, those, uh, the folks came to, the people, uh, who, who had seen this democ and lived with him. And, uh, they saw the one who had been demon possessed. They saw that he had, he had been filled with many demons and now was completely normal, completely sane, fully dressed for the first time, and they were filled with all.

But here's the interesting point. After, after having seen what Jesus did with the pigs. In the demon possessed man, they pleaded with Jesus not to stay and do more, but to leave. Won't you please leave. You've just rid this man of these demons. Will you please leave? So what are we to make of this? As I said, I wanted to suggest that Mark intend for us to see some very clear connections that are not so clear to us in our time.

I'm sure you've heard of this, you recognize the word legian. Many of you [00:18:00] will. We'll already know that the word Legion was a name, uh, for the Roman military organization. It was a, you know, a military division, uh, typically with 5,000, but not always 5,000 men. Um, and, and so the, so the word Legion itself denotes and, and reminds, echoes, uh, calls into mind the.

The, the Roman military power. There's this interesting word that's used to describe pigs, uh, that describes a herd of pigs. I dunno if you know much about pigs, but pigs don't. Pigs don't go around in herds. We don't herd pigs. Uh, pigs are are social animals, but their society consist of sows the female pigs and, and their, um.

And their pig glitz or their, you know, their, you know, the, the baby swine. Uh, and so they'll go in the largest groupings you typically would see in the social unit of pigs would be about eight. So this description of a herd of pigs numbering 2000, uh, seems to to be something that Mark is alluding to. Uh, [00:19:00] you know, that, such that folks would understand that there's something bigger here in his use of the word heard.

And, and, and one of the things that's interesting when we look at the time is, is that heard. Then and now is a common name for a herd of military recruits, uh, who were joining the Legion. And, uh, so there was a, a herd of pigs and you have all this military language. Jesus commanded the pigs, charged all sorts of things that evoke, uh, the military, uh, referenced.

To, uh, the Roman legions who dominated, uh, all of Palestine. And then of course we see the language, uh, that echoes. Uh, you know, the story from Exodus 15 and following where the seas parted and all of Pharaoh's chariots were swallowed by the sea. And this case, it's these pigs, uh, uh, that, that have been, uh, wrapped in in Roman.

Symbolism, uh, that have been swallowed by, again, that hostile sea that the disciples [00:20:00] had just crossed. And so my suggestion to you in a figurative reading is that we're to see that these demons, these many demons that possess and uh, that. You know, the demoniac is, is, is symbolic, is as is representing that military power that has colonized the minds of the people, particularly the gentile people, the Hellenized Jews as well, with this false way of seeing the world, this false view of understanding how God has ordered the world, uh, this, uh, this, they've been infected with this way.

That causes them, uh, to strike out at each other. One thing I just wanted to mention in passing, this is a, a, a, a picture of the, of the stone that we have, archeologists have, and this is actually, um, the, uh, uh, the medallion of the Roman Legion, Roman Legion. Number 10 was the legion that, uh, was that occupied Palestine.

And, uh, in sort of the equivalent of their patch on the shoulder. I know some of you guys were in the army, um, you know, the [00:21:00] equivalent of their shoulder. Uh, the, the symbol of the, uh, Roman Legion number 10 was, as you can see there a pig. So, uh, all of that has led scholars to, to understand that Mark is saying something quite interesting that we seeing here Jesus exercising the Gentiles of this worldview, of seeing justice and peace in terms of this gift from, uh, from, uh.

Caesar and understanding peace as something that, uh, we, we reach with violence and understanding justice as something that is merely, uh, conformance to the law that Caesar has, uh, dictated. I. So I wanted to pivot now to a third showdown, and I want to call it today's showdown. And, and I mean by that it's today's showdown, although it didn't begin today, it began long ago.

But this is a showdown that I think is ongoing of which we are a part. [00:22:00] And, uh, once again, I want to go back to a period that, for me, is pivotal in our own American history. And I wanna take you back to 65. Some of you guys were. Adults by then. Some of you, uh, were teenagers. Uh, I was a young kid. Um, but you'll recognize this, uh, rather fuzzy picture.

I'm sorry for the fuzziness, but it's very grainy. But what this is, if you'll remember the, the, uh, Edmund Pettus Bridge. So this is in Selma, uh, we just passed the anniversary of it recently. Um, this is, uh, uh, John Lewis. And Hosea Williams leading, uh, two by two, a peaceful march across Selma, uh, in a demonstration for giving African Americans, uh, the real right to vote, uh, in Alabama.

Uh, they, they were, they were gonna walk from Selma to Montgomery and present a petition to, uh, the, the, uh, leader. The military power and the political power in, in [00:23:00] Alabama. Who was George Wallace? Uh, what happened after that? Uh, the, you can see here, uh, his, uh, his, uh, Wallace's soldiers, if you will, his troopers and, uh, in a PO in what they call the posse men watching them as they crossed the, the, the, the George, uh, the, the Pettus Bridge.

And then you see this standoffs. This showdown, if you will, that happened as right as they came across. And there you see George, uh, uh, rather, Hosea Williams and, and and John Lewis, uh, college, uh, kid, uh, facing them. And you see, uh, the might of the soldiers, you can see the gas. Masks that they're wearing.

And just within seconds of this, uh, we saw, uh, you know, you know, great devastation, a thing that you can look up on video, a just horrendous attack by these troopers. But what I wanna suggest to you in our showdown is that once again, we're seeing the very same showdown that, that, uh, we see in second Maccabees and that we see in this story of the, uh, Garris saying.

[00:24:00] Damc. Uh, now what happened here, I think is a conflict about justice, and I wanted to share with you a story, uh, really of a conflict. Um, but there was, uh, a, a, a conflict that happened right after this. So this happened, uh, what I'm just describing, I think March 7th, uh, the very next Sunday was Palm Sunday of 1965.

Um, and there was a conflict between. Uh, Episcopal bishops in which Episcopal bishops were involved. Uh, but, but they, but, but the division I want to suggest to you is the division between those who hold the, the vision of justice that Jesus taught, that that, uh, that God taught us through Moses and the prophets that, that we call Torah.

Of, of that Jesus fulfills. Uh, and, and this is this prophetic vision of justice and it's justice that is symbolized if we wanna understand what justice is, all we have to do is look at Christ on a cross and see God and God's self offering, uh, creating a justice that is transf. [00:25:00] Formative, a justice that gives a new possibility, a new possibility of life with each other and with God in spite of our sin against each other.

And so if you wanna understand what justice is, we reflect on on that. And that's how we know what justice looks like. It does that it is our own self offering so that there is a possibility of us moving on, uh, in fellowship with God and each other. And so justice is our ment of. That, uh, and, uh, and that the prophetic vision is, has begins with an understanding that there will always be a distinction between our human laws and God's law.

That, that, uh, we see through glass, through through, we see, you know, now only through a glass darkly. And so our own efforts to, uh, embody God's. Way of being in our own laws and customs is inherently ambiguous, will always fall short. And so the prophetic vision is always this, this thing that says, uh, there is such a thing as an unjust [00:26:00] law.

And, and Martin Luther King again and again was saying to in, in not just Martin Luther King, but all of the people in the movement and including our Episcopal bishops were saying there is a distinction between the laws that you have, Caesar and. God's law. There is a such thing as an unjust law. So an unjust law, uh, uh, must be changed.

And I have no duty to obey, uh, uh, an unjust law if we want peace. Uh, you don't require me to obey your unjust law. We heal the law. We fix the problem in the law, and this was the continued. Teaching of the Civil Rights movement in that time. And this was the teaching of, of a certain set of our Episcopal bishops.

Uh, and this was in conflict with a different worldview, which saw the world as very static. The God was not creating the world anew each morning. Uh, rather. Things were, uh, given in a, in a golden era long ago. And our task is to, is to make [00:27:00] sure we don't depart from that way of being. And so the white supremacist worldview, uh, when it speaks to justice, is justice is what Caesar said.

Justice is what the law says. And so unjust law is an oxymoron. In this, in this worldview, uh, because justice just is what the law says. And so if you disobey the law, you are acting in an unjust way. So this, this peaceful protest that you're calling, these nonviolent protests are actually doing unjust.

And this is the white ju supremacist justification of resisting this prophetic vision. This came to a great clash within the Episcopal Church, and I'm trying to say to you today, it continues as a clash. Not just within the Episcopal Church, but not so much within the Episcopal Church actually, but certainly within American Christianity.

This, this con conflict, this, this really sharp conflict and on our understanding of how we know what justice is, uh, this static worldview versus this dynamic worldview, uh, this [00:28:00] understanding that, uh, we are called to heal and fix unjust laws. So this is what happened after that conflict. Those in power seizures folks took over and as you know, they, uh, they, they tear gassed the folks there and have an image.

Here. You can see this is, uh, John Lewis, uh, having his head bashed in. He had, uh, his, he, he went, he was hospitalized and, uh, and uh, and now we have a, a Voting Rights Act that's in our Congress that's called the John Lewis. Voting, uh, act. And, uh, it's because of his involvement in this quest for equal rights in, in, you know, in the polls for all Americans.

Uh, because this act of Caesar, this act of George Wallace, this act of all of his kind of white supremacist in the world wasn't the end of the story. But the sad part of the story is what happened at, uh, in the Episcopal Church. This is a picture of St. Paul's in Selma, St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Selma.

Um. [00:29:00] And on Palm Sunday, just after bloody Sunday, uh, back in 65, uh, we had this, this, uh, moment in which, uh, 200 clergy right after Bloody Su Sunday, two, you know, there was this time, uh, of what do we do next? Because the march to Selma, it was, you know, was interrupted. It was stopped. The, uh, by the troopers of, of Wallace and, uh, with, with, you know, Roman violence in the same, in the same kind of Roman violence.

And it was stopped and it appeared that the Civil Rights Movement, uh, had been defeated at least, uh, temporarily. And, and we had, uh. Clergy from the Episcopal church that descended upon Selma and 200 gathered, and they went to, uh, uh, St. Paul's Episcopal church on that Palm Sunday to worship. And there, uh, they, uh, uh, were met by, um.

Pastor, uh, Frank Matthews, or rather Father f Matthews, who, uh, uh, who [00:30:00] noted that they had folks from St. Mark's, uh, mission, which was a, a mission that included black Christians, Episcopal, uh, black Episcopalians. And he refused their admittance saying to them, is it Christian for you to bring guests? With measles.

And uh, and that was his way of demanding that only the whites could enter into the church to worship. Uh, the church was a segregated space and, uh, and this, this was, he was just the first foot soldier. This, because he was backed up by his bishop. Bishop, CCCJ Carter, the Bishop of Alabama, uh uh, who on this Palm Sunday.

There were, there were at least 12 Episcopal bishops who gathered there at, uh, at, at uh, St. Paul's that day, uh, right after Bloody Sunday and went into worship. And, uh, Bishop Carpenter, uh, refused permission for any Episcopal bishop to celebrate the Eucharist in any altar in Alabama, [00:31:00] uh, because of. Is concerned that they would celebrate the Eucharist with persons of color.

So this is our legacy, this is our history. Uh, and so what did those bishops do? And I should share with you some of their names in a second. Uh, but, uh, uh, they, they went out and they performed the Eucharist. Those who were on the other side of this conflict, they performed the Eucharist in a, in a high fashion with incense and smokes and bells on the sidewalks.

And they used vessels that they had borrowed from that mission congregation from Birmingham. Uh, so, uh, this was a conflict in which we had a key part. Uh, and I, my point in talking about this, uh, is these, some of these bishops, you know, you remember Bishop Pike, you remember? Bishop Moore of New York, uh, Bishop Myers of Michigan.

Folks who would later be involved in other, uh, battlegrounds of the same conflict. The battle over whether women, uh, can be ordained as priests, whether women can be ordained as [00:32:00] bishops, whether gay persons can be ordained as. Priests or consecrated his bishops and so forth. We, uh, continue to have, uh, this battle over what justice is and what fellowship with each other looks like.

Uh, and it's rooted in, I say in this ideology, uh, that we see Jesus taking on, uh, in his story of the garc. And so, so the rest of the story, of course, is good news, uh, a few days later, uh, you know, having seen on the right hand side those images from, from bloody Sunday, we see, uh, there on the left you can see the image of John Lewis in that blue sweater.

Uh. His head somewhat healed, um, uh, marching next to Coretta Scott King and Martin Luther King. And in the in and there were hun there were hundreds of Episcopal clergy and rabbis and clergy from the Unitarian Church and other churches in that long line. They've already, in this picture, crossed the PTUs bridge there en [00:33:00] route, uh, to Montgomery, uh, to present their petition for votes.

Uh, they're protected by, uh, the United States Army. Along the way, uh, Martin Luther King will take that hat off and put it on John Lewis's head to protect his wound along the way and the soldiers, the United States Army soldiers for the first time would not point their guns at the, at the protestors, but point their guns outward from those marching.

To, uh, those who threatened peace, who threatened justice, this prophetic justice, uh, in the form of, uh, the Ku Klux k Clay, KU Klux Klan, and others influenced by that ideology. So the rest of the story, and this March continues brothers and sisters. Um, so, um, you know, one thing I I thought was really interesting that, uh, celebrating the 50.

50th anniversary of this moment, uh, that little old congregation [00:34:00] that st. Uh, mark's, uh, from Birmingham, that Negro Mission congregation and St. Paul's celebrated the yuca together on the 50th anniversary of that date, there is indeed hope for us. So brothers and sisters, I, I think that, uh. We, um, have a story here that is, is Jesus's calling to us to remember that justice is something that we are always to be seeking to understand that there is indeed something as an unjust law.

We are never finished. Seeking in our time, uh, the kingdom, and we should expect that resistance. It will be hard, but that when we follow the way of love, that Jesus is nonviolent way of speaking, love into such violence. Uh, we are exercised of our demons and we find the peace. A priest that threatens many, but a piece that God intends for us all.

What a beautiful, beautiful calling for us to have. And I think that is the, the good news. Today, this good [00:35:00] news that we are called to do something of such endearing value. May you be blessed by it. May we may we all respond to that calling each and every day of our lives. In the name of the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit.

Amen.
