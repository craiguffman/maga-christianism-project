# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 34

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we, uh. Encounter a word that I know is familiar to you at least. Uh, one of the, one of the stories of it you often hear about this time of year, uh, which I, as I'll come to later, is, uh, something of a, a tragedy. The way we have domesticated a word from Jesus that, uh, and in, in, in, in context, as you'll see in the, in the art that Mark is doing here, and presenting Jesus' life in the last few days of his life is actually quite a, uh.

Uh, a powerful word that, uh, is meant to convict us, uh, and certainly was meant to convict the people of his time, uh, and draw them closer to the Lord. Um, I wanted to, um, spend a little bit of time reminding you of where we are as we work through Mark's gospel, as we've been working through Mark's Go Gospel since, uh, earlier the spring, uh, actually earlier in the winter.

Of, of 2021. Um, and, and, and [00:01:00] remind you that what we have been trying to do is understand Mark, uh, literarily. And so one of the things we've done, uh, is, is, is sought to understand his. Art and the way he is putting things together and, and grouping things in such a way to present a particular understanding.

And one of the things that, uh, we read in, in his gospel very early on, uh, when he was up in Galilee, uh, this was before Easter. Jesus had begun his, his Galilean campaign. And we remember this story where his, his, his family arrived and they were outside the home at Capernaum, or Peter's mother was living with Peter.

And they sent word into him and, uh, there was a crowd around him and, and they said, look, your mom, your dad, your, I mean your mom, your brothers and sisters are outside looking for you. And he replied, who is my mother? Who are my brothers? He looked around at those who were seated around him, the [00:02:00] disciples, and, and he said, look, here are my brother.

Here are my, here are my mother and my brothers. And then he, he made this very important point. Whoever does God's will is my brother, sister, and mother. I, I wanna remind you of that because that's how the mark in his art. His retelling of Jesus's first Galilean campaign when he announced his ministry went out and then, and Mark told the story of him visiting the, the synagogue.

And in many of the healings he ended this one. And, and one of the things we see happening there was Jesus was. Um, rupturing, uh, he was, he was parting himself, distancing himself, uh, from the fundamental structure of all of human life, the, of our social life, and that is our family. And, and Jesus there in, in this, in this concluding portion of that campaign, redefined.

What family [00:03:00] is now, mark is writing sometime around 66, about, uh, you know, a, a couple of decades after Paul had written several of his epistles. And Paul, throughout his epistles also remembers Jesus and speaks of Jesus redefining what family means in this way. Uh, what, what, what constitutes family is not.

Our blood relationship, what constitutes family is our God relationship, our obedience, our experience of God's grace as command. Those who do that, who have been given that become our newly recon constituted family in the kingdom of God. I wanna remind you of that because today we see Jesus ending his Jerusalem campaign and we see Mark doing something very similar.

Uh, we see now Mark breaking, uh, rather Jesus breaking with a another fundamental structure. This one being I. The, the [00:04:00] national communal life, the political life as it was constituted around the temple. Uh, and once again, we see Jesus at the conclusion of our, of our text today, redefining what communion with God is and how we are to go about communion with God and how to go to go about fellowship with God and each other.

Uh, and once again, he's saying that is not placed based on blood. In other words, it's not based on just for the fact that you. Have, uh, Jewish blood in you, uh, that you are, uh, protected from God's wrath, nor because of your social station, because you are of great power. Uh, the one thing, uh, that, that, uh, constitutes our fellowship with each other is our, our experience of God's grace as command, our obedience to God's will, our alignment of our will.

Our will with Gods. That's what, uh, co, uh, constitutes our fellowship and communion and what we're gonna see [00:05:00] here is Jesus is taking on the temple and repudiating it and then promising to rebuild another in its place, the Temple of the Holy Spirit. We don't get to that last part today, so let's take the text today.

Uh, in, in, in order, we'll talk about this, this enigmatic, uh, uh, introduction where we see Jesus, uh, uh, having last week, uh, uh, completed the readings where he had been taking on all comers, sort of playing all against, all in the temple. And so we saw the Pharisees, the sades, the. The Sanhedrin all coming, trying to intimidate Jesus and then, and then walking away with their tails between their legs.

Uh, and now Jesus finally said, uh, offers a monologue. He no one's asking the question. Jesus, this time asks the question. And, um, to understand this question, I wanna speak a little bit about something that I think is. Human nature. Nietzsche spoke about the Uber mic, uh, a German word that, uh, we might translate as Superman.

And [00:06:00] how, and what I wanna remind us of is a phenomenon that Nietzsche taught us about that we see often, uh, uh, and that is where we ourselves have this longing that just if someone would come to our aid, if some knight would come, slay the dragons for us, we, everything would be fine. And, and we have this desire that, for this.

The Superman, this Uber man true, would rise up and, and restore the traditional values that we cherish and assure our place in the social order. Uh, and so we have this yearning that we see throughout history. Nietzche noted it and, and uh, uh, and, and we and I, and I think if you, in later on we'll actually talk about some examples of that.

But, but one of the things that happens is. When we find ourselves in such a state, culturally, uh, where we feel lost or we see our ways, uh, becoming lost and we we're having this yearning for this desire, one of the things we will do is when we [00:07:00] see someone rising up, uh, we will, uh, uh, change our own. Ways in order to conform to the ways of this leader in order to exercise a, a sense of belonging.

So we'll subordinate truth in order to conform to that of the Uber mech, uh, and, and thereby assure our own belongingness to the movement that, that the Superman is creating. And I say this in order to help us understand what Jesus is. Doing here. Uh, this is a phenomenon that, you know, ichi's talking at the beginning of the 20th century.

Um, we're talking now, uh, at, at, at, you know, around, uh, 30 to 40, uh, in the common era. Uh, and, and, and the, the, that yearning was still present. There was a present, there was a yearning for a king who would come, a Messiah, who would come among the Jews, and that Messiah, they, the, you know, the, the ideology went like this, that, that Messiah would come and the Messiah.

Would, would, would be strong and he would [00:08:00] liberate the Jews and the Palestine from the ones who were in the way of, of our own self. Um, you know, our own autonomy and particularly the, the autonomy of those in power. And that, in that, in that case, the, the ones to be, the oppressors to be thrown off were, first of all the, the foreigners who were from Rome, you know, the Roman Empire, and secondly.

The group, uh, that Mark calls the Herodians. And what I mean by that were these imposters who had been on the throne since, uh, you know, for almost 150 years. Uh, and in governing in some way, uh, Palestine, they, they were not even Jews. They were from the family of Esau. Descended from Esau, not Jacob. And the, the, and the chief priest families were not descended from Aaron as Torah required.

They were, uh, the, the, the descendants of, uh, the Hasson, uh, who were never priests. They were not a priestly family. And so I. There was this expectation that someday, uh, a, a legitimate king, a [00:09:00] legitimate king would arise, who would also, uh, be the chief priest of all. And he would come and he would throw all those out and then restore the temple state, uh, establishment that, uh, had had, uh, that people remembered nostalgically.

Um. And so the claim was that, is that the Messiah, when the Messiah come, would, would achieve this and would reestablish King David's line. King David was the, the great king of the Jews who, who had an empire, the, the northern and southern kingdom, he consolidated. So what we know as Galilee and what we know as Juda Judea, were all one.

Uh, and, and nostalgically the, the Jews remembered. That is a great time where the monarchy was built up. Now, in the reading that we read that, that Tom read to us so brilliantly, uh, from from the prophet Micah, you see, uh, um, uh, the, the, the other viewpoint of that nostalgic, um, recollection, it was the prophet Micah.

[00:10:00] Condemning that era, the era of the kings, and, and, and speaking about how, uh, the, the, the, the temple state devoured God's children devoured in particular the poor. And so the ones who were yearning nostalgically for this time were the ones who benefited from it. Uh, and so as they thought about who the Messiah would be, uh, they, they, they thought of, of the Messiah being one.

Someone that I'm gonna, I'm gonna suggest was, uh. Uh, a Caesar who would come who had Christ's soul, but Caesar's might, as I said, he'd be Moses in, in Caesar's chariots. You know, sort of a combination of those, those two things. Now we need to remember one of the sets of characters here, because what Jesus is gonna do is particularly indict one group of all the groups that have been taking him on and just condemn them.

And so we need to remember who they were. Uh, in our text it says, Hey, beware of the lawyers. Right? Um, the, the, the, the scribes, the, you know, which is translated on text today as the [00:11:00] legal experts, um, were a part of what we call the artisan class. Now, of the a hundred percent of the population in Palestine, about 2% constituted the elite.

Those oligarchy fa oligarchic families that had taken. Control of the land and in the wealth of the people, the promised land. Uh, and, and Jesus often condemns them, but, and there was another group who were, were, were members of what we call the artisan class. About 8% constituted this and this 8% mostly were employed in the bureaucracy.

They were the employees of the 2%, if you will, but they were the ones in power at middle level. They controlled importantly, access to God. Access to grace we might say today. Um, uh, and the way they control that access to God, uh, is through the, their teaching, through their interpreter, their interpretation of Torah, uh, through their role as the ones who would judge, uh.

Uh, right and wrong, and whether a person was clean and unclean and whether [00:12:00] they could enter or, or, or not enter the temple at any given time in their lives. And, and we've seen Jesus taking them on and condemning, uh, many of these things. If you call just one example of, of, of the disciples eating corn in the fields on the Sabbath and being condemned of that, or, uh, or, or the way that women.

Uh, we're, we're treated multiple times. We've spoken about that. In fact, last Sunday we spoke about, uh, Jesus' attitudes, uh, towards, uh, the patriarchy, uh, which was, which was grounded in Torah. Uh, so, so the, the, the scribes were the ones who, who had ministered, uh, administered all of that. Now, most of the people, the people of the land nstitute about 90%.

They were peasants and living right on, um, the level of, uh, subsistence. Um, now some of the Pharisees, uh, were Sri, I mean, some of the scribes were Pharisees. I. And, uh, and, and some of them held sad Jae in view. So [00:13:00] we can't, we can't say that the scribes were either Pharisee or sad jasi. And they were, they were both.

But most of the scribes, particularly in Galilee, were of the Pharisaic party from which Paul would arrive. So that's the story, that's the setup. And so what we see here is after how, after playing all against all in the temple for three days, Jesus was teaching and he asked this question, why do the scribes say that Christ is David's son?

Now you guys might scratch your heads when you remember when you read this 'cause you say, wait, I thought Jesus was the son of David. I thought that's one of the titles we give him. You. I thought Matthew and his gospel spends an awful lot of time, uh, demonstrating in, in, in chapter one of, in the genealogy.

You know, the Jesus was descended from David. Uh, and, and that's certainly true, but Jesus says, why is it so important to the legal experts to say that Christ is David's son? And then he quotes the, this Psalm 110 that, uh, that Mary Jo read to us [00:14:00] this story, uh, the psalm, which, uh, that which was, uh, known as the coronation psalm.

It was a psalm that was, was read during the coronation of the King. Now Jesus says that it was written by David himself and by tradition we say that the Salter. Uh, was produced by David. Now, scholars today wouldn't, uh, wouldn't agree with that, but Jesus says David himself, by the Holy Spirit, declared the Lord said to my Lord.

Sit at my right hand, and this is the king. In other words, this is King David. Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. And so in the coronation psalm, it speaks about how the king would be, uh, because of the Lord's presence, be a great warrior and protect the nation of Israel. But then Jesus reasons from that.

Well, if David in writing the Psalm. You know, caused the one to whom who, whom to whom he was writing. Lord the Messiah. How can he be? How can the Messiah be David's son? [00:15:00] And what Jesus is saying here is that the Messiah is senior to the King David. He, he though he is ge, he's not speaking genealogically.

He's he's speaking ideologically. In other words, yes, the, the Messiah is deed of David's line and Jesus we know was of David's Lyme. But the Messiah, Jesus is saying is superior to David and he reasoned that we know that just. You know, by pointing to Psalm one 10. And so what Jesus is doing is a very important thing.

He's saying that the Messiah is not coming to carry on the Davidic, the dynasty, not to restore it. In fact, we know Jesus is inaugurating the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of David, not re rehabilitating it. Right? And he's saying the Messiah will not do that. So he is renouncing the agenda. Many of the people who sing Hosannas would hope he would do this.

This desire for Uber min, uh, [00:16:00] Jesus is repudiating that saying, no, no, that's not who the Messiah is. The Messiah is actually the one to whom all of these are accountable. So Jesus repudiates the idea that he has in particular calmed to restore the temple state, the temple, and, and all that it consisted of as an economic and.

Political center and a spiritual center. Jesus has not come to restore that. That's what he's saying in this little dialogue here, where he criticizes the scribes and, and he's just begun his criticism, folks. But one of the things you see here is that you know the crowd, the people of the land hear this and they know who.

You know, the, you know, restoring the Davidic dynasty means all the wealthy are, are going to be sustained in their positions. And so the crowd, the people of the land, that 90% who are the peasants, you know, they listen to him with delight because he says that's not what's happening here. And then Jesus, um, makes a really [00:17:00] critical move here and literally critical, uh, he.

He absolutely condemns the scribal class for being the engines of, uh, the, the, the engines of exploitation. And he uses the language that Tom read to us from the prophet Micah in chapter three. Uh, you know, basically, you know, condemning the scribal class of all of those things that you see. Uh, in chapter three of Micah.

So, so he said, he says, beware of those legal experts. He's talking to all the people gathered there in the temple. So the, so right in front of these legal experts, he is saying, beware of the legal experts surrounding you. Imagine this folks. They're, they're hearing this and he's indicting him right in front of their faces, and he says they like to walk around in their long robes.

They, they want you to greet them with honor to, to, to, uh, to where to, you know, to, to, uh, [00:18:00] defer to them in the marketplaces. They want to be seated in the places of honor, whether it's in the synagogue or at banquets. And yet they are the ones who cheat widows right out of Micah. They are the ones that actually is, is the word is to devour widows is, is what he says.

They devour widows out of their homes. They, they take, they cheat widows outta their homes and, and, and to show off, uh, they say long prayers. Uh, and he says they will be judged most hard harshly. What is Jesus talking about when he says that the scribes are devouring the estates of widows? Well, some background here, what we know is these scribes, as I said, they were the bureaucracy.

They were like lawyers today. Uh, but one of the things they did is they abused their official positions. And so, uh, the scribes routinely would be given. Uh, trusteeship of, uh, states when females, uh, were widowed. Um, uh, females, as you [00:19:00] recall, had no political power, no high political identity apart from a male in, in, uh, in, in the air in that time.

Uh, and so the scribes would then would be given the legal right. To administer those estates and they would charge a percentage of assets, not, not unlike certain arrangements we have in our own time. And of course, that practice was well known and, and we see in the literature outside of the Bible, the extra biblical literature, lots of complaints, lots of concerns for embezzlement and abuse, just like Prophet Mic, the prophet Micah accused them of in his time.

And so the Jews, Jesus says, were called. Actually to protect, especially a few classes, I'm hopeful by now, you can name those classes, you know, orphans, widows, and aliens in the land. Yet the scribes were not doing that in the name of their offices. They were exploiting these [00:20:00] classes and getting richer.

While holding these classes in positions of poverty. Now, more than that, and this is where Jesus' indictment gets really tough and related to the temple state, they were to administer the access to the temple through their interpretation of Jewish laws. And so think about a, a world that is created in a, in which a woman is told that she is unclean.

And she can't have access to God unless she becomes clean. And the only way she can have access to God is to go into the temple. But the only way she can go into the temple is if, uh, if it to to be atuned with God is if she performs certain rites. In order to do those, uh, perform those rights, she has to sacrifice something of economic value.

She has to give, uh, some valued animal for the scribal class and the priestly class to eat, um, and, and to put it [00:21:00] into the coffers of the temple. Uh, money that would then be used for a variety of purposes. Um, and, and only by, by. Fulfilling this scribal class, mandated set of actions. Could that woman be made one with God?

That was the teaching, that's what was being taught. And, uh, this is the ideology of the temple state. And it, and of course, if you think about it, what it does is it, it, uh, multiplies the power of the temple. It makes the temple absolutely central to everything. And those who run the temple the most powerful in the land.

It makes those who, uh, live in fear that their crops will fail and in fear that their babies won't have food, uh, uh, desperate and willing to do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means, uh, humiliating themselves in front of these, uh, scribes in flowing robes. So that's what Jesus is [00:22:00] condemning. And so Mark tells us that Jesus, uh, sat out in the, it would've been in the temple, in the, uh, court of the Gentiles.

Uh, he set, he set across from this collection pot, uh, that was there, collection boxes that were there, there were a dozen of them. Uh, you know, one, you know, sim symbolically, a dozen of them, uh, there in the court of Gentiles. And, uh, and he watched how the people gave their money, and what he noticed was the rich people.

Threw in lots of money, very ostentatiously. And then he, he remarked upon one poor widow who came and she put in, uh, the word that here gets translated into penny, but it, but it, but she put in two small copper coins, uh, that, that, uh, were today they would be worth a fraction of a penny. So very little value, but Jesus remarks that this was everything that she had.

He says, I, and listen to this, not in, well listen to what Jesus had to say from the perspective of someone who [00:23:00] had great compassion upon this widow, but anger at the the temple. State class, uh, in, in, in rules that were causing her to do what she was doing. He says, I assure you that this poor woman has put in more than everyone who's putting money in the treasury.

All of them are giving outta their spare change, but she, from her hopeless poverty has given everything she had. Even what she ne needed to live on. In other words, even what God gave her to live on, she has transferred to the temple. Jesus is not smiling upon this woman. One of the things that I have, I, I, I regret is, is uh, the times that I have, uh, believed what I was told, that this was some sort of, that Jesus was trying to point to, oh, we should all be like the widow who gave the widows might.

What in context of Mark's art, that is not at all what Jesus is saying. He certainly is compassionate about the widow, but he [00:24:00] isn't pointing and he's not delighted with what she's doing. He's angry about what she's doing. So let's talk about the cost of belongingness that this ideology created. The widows might had been, uh, in, in our church, has been weaponized by clergy like myself.

Against you telling you that what Jesus was doing here was, was, was pointing to you and we should all remember the widows might and then give whatever we have and insisting that the way you demonstrate your faith is to transfer your very last penalty, penny to the church. And, and, and this is particularly during the season for that man.

This is, this is stewardship campaign time and this is where. All over the land that you have, you have clergy who are pointing to this and saying, Hey, whatever you got, you need to give it to the church to support it. So that's what Jesus was saying. And the only way we can make you believe that is if we strip this text out of context and, and make it a small saying, we're all we read about is the widow's story and we don't show you what's on the front of or [00:25:00] the back of it.

So you can't tell that Jesus was in fact angry. That describes we're taking the money out of this widow's hand that were, were supposed to be her last pennies for survival to enrich themselves. We miss that. And, and so what, what we see here is this thing that we call today a prosperity gospel. You guys have seen the, the televangelists who do this today, they, they abuse god's people.

By, by, by preaching this gospel that says if you wanna get healed, if you, if you wanna have your life turned around, call 800 such and such right now and pledge your money and send us a check and gobbles, you know, smile upon you. You know, that's the way, uh, things are done today and our time quite a bit in the church.

Things are done that same way. Our political arena in the secular arena as well. We have, uh, a hunger to belong to the movement of [00:26:00] the uberin. We have a hunger to align ourselves with the, with the, with the ones who represent the God or or who, whoever is going to deliver us from our faith. And we do things that are absolutely crazy in order to align ourself with that.

So. The widow, we created an ideology so that the widow gave everything that she was supposed to be feeding herself in the hope that that would be used by the people God had entrusted in the proper way. We see that same thing happening in our time. The the folks who. Ought to know better. Being taught that they need to, to perform acts to show their alignment with the Uber minch, to show their alignment with this, this figure who is going to save them and restore the, the, the, the, the glorious days of, uh, of America.

Um, you're gonna make America great again in order to do that, to show that you get it and you're gonna be a [00:27:00] part of those who are gonna be saved when we make America great again. Uh, you need to prove that piety by, uh, by, by being an anti-vaxxer, by by. By suffering a disease, by, by even, even accepting death.

That that's what it's to take to, just to show that you're, you're demonstrate that you are part of this movement of the one who's going to protect you and restore the old social order. This is the, this is just a secularized version of the Prosperity Gospel folks, uh, with the Uber minch now supplanting God.

As the bearer of our transcendent values. It's, it's nationalism rather than Judaism here. But it's the same thing, folks, and we ought to have eyes to see it. And one of the things we have to do is, is affirm the, the myth of a stolen election as a way of affirming and demonstrating your faith in the Uber mesh.

This is just an old story folks that we're seeing today. Jesus was condemning it. 2000 [00:28:00] years ago, but he was, he was condemning the scribble class for this very same thing. One of the most recent ones that really angers me is a story, uh, by Tony Morrison. A beautiful story, uh, uh, uh, about the, the liberation of enslaved peoples called Beloved, uh, and, and, and folks burning that book, trying to banish it at the school board because it speaks.

Against this nostalgic time, uh, when, when everything in America was great and that and, and, and, and, uh, frankly, us white folks didn't have to to answer, uh, for the fact that we were enslaving God's people. Uh, and so burning the beloved as a sign, as a ritual of our atonement with the Uber Mitch folks, this is happening again in our time and Jesus.

He had enough of this. And so once again, we have this thing where I've described to you in Mark Gospel, mark, we see this, this [00:29:00] move that he makes where judgment is the way Jesus is saving us, judging that which has become demonic, judging the institutions that we have created that no longer generate the good, no longer move towards the good that God desires for us, but rather simply enrich ourselves, uh, at the expense of those who.

Uh, we are supposed to protect. And so as Jesus left the temple, one of his disciples says to him, teacher, look what awesome stones and buildings, you know, they're tourists from Galilee. Might've been the first time they've been to the temple. And, and, and their heart swell at just the majesty of this thing that her had had, uh, created.

And, and during Mark's gospel was just finished in the year 65. So right like the year before, mark wrote his gospel. This place of glory, you know, they cut the ribbon on, it was done right? Um, and, and so look at, look at these awesome stones. What majesty? And Jesus says, see these things, [00:30:00] not even one stone will be left upon another.

All will be demolished. Now folks, Jesus said this in the, you know, somewhere in the year 30, Mark's recounting it, you know, somewhere around 66 to 68, when in fact the people to whom he's writing know this temple is in fact about to be demolished. It's gonna be destroyed by the Romans, but Jesus speaks about it in the inner year, year 30, and he condemns the temple state.

Uh, and I wanna just remind you of these words that, that, that Tom read to us in here. Jesus' Prophetic words echoing Micah, where he says, leaders of Jacob, rulers of the house of Israel. That's the, that's the temple state. The people who are in charge. Isn't it your job to know justice? You who hate the good and love the evil who tear the skin off of my people and the flesh off their bones, who eat the flesh of my people, fla their skin off of them, break their bones in pieces and chop them up [00:31:00] like meat in a kettle.

Like flesh in a cauldron. Wow. As the prophet Micah in Jesus's echoing this and, and, and he, and he says to all these who had this responsible, who led the people astray, um, uh, that, that, uh, uh, it will, that, that will be become night for you. That, that God will not hear your prayers. That, uh, the day will be dark upon upon them, and you will, you will be disgraced.

Uh, and then you will, and God won't hear you. And he says this thing that, that he quotes here. Uh, I am filled with power. I am filled with the spirit of love, with the spirit of justice in might. And I speak with that in order to declare to Jacob, that's Israel, uh, your wrongdoing and to name Israel's sin.

And so this is what Jesus is enacting here. This is the illusion that he's making here. Uh. Uh, all of those who reject justice and [00:32:00] make crooked, all that is straight. What they're going to see, uh, is that the temple will be destroyed. That's what Micah predicted, and that's what Jesus is saying here.

Because of what they have done, Jerusalem will become piles of rubble and the temple Mount will become an overgrown mo mound. Uh, and that, uh, was associated with the Messiah. So Jesus here is saying, you know, that Michael was predicting the Messiah. He and and I as the Messiah am affirming Micah. Got it right.

Tough, tough word. Now, the good news is Micah's prophecy doesn't end in chapter three. And Jesus's word doesn't end in with this exit from the temple. I want to remind you of some things that you guys might have thought. Some of these words came from a rock song from the sixties, but he actually came from prophet Isaiah and prophet, uh, Micah.

Both have the same words. Uh, interestingly enough about the good news, the [00:33:00] gospel, uh, that that will happen after this, because this is what the prophet said. In the days to come, the mountain of the Lord's house, that's the temple, will in fact be the highest of the mountains. It will in fact be lifted above the hills.

Peoples will stream to it, peoples will stream to it, and many nations will go and say, come. Let's go to the mountain of the Lord, to the House of Jacob's God, so that he may teach us his ways and we may all walk in the way of the Lord. And you may remember this portion here, the where it says, God will judge between the nations and settle the disputes.

And this is the part that's the rock song from the sixties, a Vietnam, uh, protest song. They will beat their swords into iron plows and their spears into pruning tools. Nation will not take up nation, uh, uh, war against nation, and they will no longer learn how to make war. So the good news is that Jesus is judging the temple state.

Saying God's will. [00:34:00] God's word will not return Empty. God's word will bring about the good that God desires for all of God's people. So those who were in charge, who were supposed to be doing that well, they won't hear God's prayers, but you, the people, the land do not live in fear. 'cause God is in fact doing a great thing in your midst.

That's, uh, where we get the part that George Washington quoted in his letter. I've mentioned this, uh, at this time in this eschatological time, when, when time is fulfilled, when God's purposes are filled, all will sit underneath their own grapevines, their olive trees for the mouth of the Lord of heavenly forces.

Has spoken. So that's the good news today, folks. Really tough words if you are one of those folks who, um, could, uh, hear a word. Accountability, you know, as a member of our own scribal class, certainly I, uh, stand in that line, uh, and, and I hear the, you know, [00:35:00] the judgment of God. Upon all that I do and the warnings here, and I hope that any of us who hear this word are able to hear that Jesus is calling us not to be, uh, those who expect, uh, uh, the Messiah to restore the things for which we're nostalgic, uh, to restore the glory Days of America, to restore the glory days of Israel, which in fact.

Were not so glorious for the poor, not glorious for the marginalized, not glorious for anybody except those who were in power. Uh, and so Jesus says, no, I'm not coming to restore the Davidic uh, monarchy. I'm proclaiming a new kingdom, God's kingdom, which is not intended to be a kingdom of chariots and war, but a kingdom of peace.

He repu, he repudiates all of our exploitive ideologies, all the ways that we devour the poor [00:36:00] and justify it in God's name, which is exactly what he accused the scribes of doing, what he accuses us of doing in our own forms of the prosperity gospels, uh, both secular and religious. And then Jesus judges.

The structures that we have in our lives today that we have erected, uh, that no longer serve the good. And he says, God will turn God's back on those and let them wither like the grass. And yet God is in fact making all things new, giving life. To life giving structures that, or were born along the way of love and, and let's be clear about what the temple is that he's building.

He, Jesus is saying in this place that spoke to be a house of prayer for all the nations, that was the temple will be no more. That's no longer where God will call the nations to be a house of prayer instead. God is building a new [00:37:00] temple of the Holy Spirit. That's the fellowship that binds you and me together in love, and that that body is the new house of prayer, supplanting that temple state, and it is the one that carries.

Forward. So our charge is to carry forward this good news, uh, so that, so that all are invited to this new house of prayer, this new way of being with God that is open to all. That's the good news. It means our lives are filled with purpose. Folks, we got a lot of good news to share, a lot of fellowship to live.

I hope you hear that word and spread it and share it in our moved by on this day. In the name of the Father, son, holy Spirit. Amen.
