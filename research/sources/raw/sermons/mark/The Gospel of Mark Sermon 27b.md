# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 27b

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. I, uh, had a difficult time trying to figure out what to do about this week's election. We're working, as, you know, through our way through the gospel of Mark, and, and we've been trying to read it, uh, as, as, as Mark was, as Mark intended. He, he wrote it, uh, with extraordinary art and we've been trying to understand.

What he says to us about who Jesus is and how we are to follow Jesus by taking very seriously, uh, his art. You know, we're doing a literary reading of that gospel. And so now today we come to this, uh, text that is, uh, very near to the hearts of many folks who have gone through the great struggle of divorce and I.

Frankly asked myself how, you know, what can I say that is the good news about this doctrine? Uh, and as and, and as always, when I have such things, I talk to my muse, uh, my wife Sina, and she says, Craig, what [00:01:00] are you talking about? It's nine 11. And I, as I thought about it, I really, I thought, you know what? I think our reflecting a bit on nine 11 is actually the key to, to today for us to.

To understand this text as good news, and that, that might seem a bit of a stretch for some of you. So I'm gonna ask you to bear with me as I, as I, uh, pull several threads together over the course of our time together this morning. Um, so, um, what I wanna do first though is, um, this is, uh, real quickly.

Review and, and really, so, so that we can set aside, uh, the, the, the teaching of the church on divorce because, uh, it, it, it, it, the temptation for us is just to focus entirely on the section of this text, uh, that's about divorce and, and, and, and as though that's the question that's important today. Um, uh, and then thereby, I think, missed what Mark was actually doing.[00:02:00] 

Uh, and so let's real quickly deal with what, uh, we understand the way we as a church have, have learned to think about divorce and sort of set that aside so then we can step back and look at the big picture of what Mark is doing and understand this conversation that Jesus has about divorce, and ask the question, why would Mark have included this?

This recollection of Jesus's teaching that divorce where he did and in the way he did, and what are we to make of it? About what, what he is telling us about how we are to follow in the way of love. So let's real quickly review. Uh, what we understand about divorce and I've, I've spent a lot of time with, uh, with, with, uh, those who are members of our parish, uh, uh, on this before in the last, uh, 18 months.

Uh, so forgive me if you hear me once again saying something that's, that should be familiar to you. For our other listeners though, I just want to recount, uh, a few things and the, the first point I would make is for us to have any understanding, even think clearly about [00:03:00] divorce. We actually shouldn't begin with divorce.

But begin with what we understand marriage to be. And that's really what Jesus does in our gospel lesson. And the thing that I would say to, to us is that for, for us, marriage is a sacrament. We speak of sacramental marriage, and when we say something is sacramental, what we're saying is there's by, by God's grace, something is.

Both a sign, in other words, something that, that, uh, reminds us of God's presence, of God's promises to be present to us, and it is the manifestation of that very presence. In other words, as we, as we do this, we both signify God's presence and we enact God's presence. And so marriage at our most fundamental level of, of human communion at the family level, at the where, where, you know, which is truly the.

You know, the battleground against Satan, uh, uh, in, in, you know, where, where that battle is, is most commonly flawed. Uh, sacramental marriage is a, is a gift from God, uh, that, that enables our community to be what God intends us to [00:04:00] be. And it enables us, uh, especially to bring children up to understand how to be who God called.

Them to be. And the, and the important point about marriage, uh, when it is sacramental it, we, we have two people who are stepping forth for the benefit of the community who are saying, Hey, God, I promise that I will, uh, be an instrument for you. Use me, Lord, use me so that, uh, I might be one. Who channels your love that you feel for this person, this man, this woman.

Uh, so that, so that they, you know, that they experience through me the love that you feel for them and, and add my love to it. But the important point, God is I want to be out. I wanna get out of the way, uh, in our relationship so that all they experience is the love that you have for them. And, and. And, uh, and that you'll then use me in that way.

And, and I promise that the way I'll do that, and this is where it becomes a sacrament, is I will try, I will strive to love them as you love me. I will [00:05:00] strive to love them so that, uh, uh, the basis of my love isn't how well they perform, but rather, uh, it, it, the basis of, of our love is, is your love for me.

In other words, I forgive them unconditionally in advance, uh, for all the, I. Their, their, their sins of omission and commission and promise simply to be present to them, to, to never abandon them. Um, and, uh, and, and then so being I will then be that instrument of grace in our, in our home will be a sanctuary of love.

And so that's how we understand what sacramental marriage is, because when our homes are. Those sanctuary of love, sanctuaries of love, well then God is indeed present at that most foundational level of human community. And, and so when we baptize children, particularly in infant baptism, uh, we're saying the same thing, but we're just pulling the children.

Into those promises. We, we promise the same thing that we, we [00:06:00] promised God about that, that, um, that mate of ours, we, we say, well, I make that same promise to those child. I promise never to be except to be with that child, uh, that this child doesn't get to vote on whether I will love them. No matter how they behave, I will be present to them just Lord, as you have promised, always to be with me and have in fact been with me.

So that's how we understand marriage and family, uh, in a very Christian way. And so when we think about divorce, we are saying, what do we do? What do we give to, uh, how do we name, uh, the reality that sometimes. Uh, those unions that are created in Great Hope end in the impossibility of that union being such a sign in the refusal of one or both of the, of the couple, uh, to be a sign and manifestation of God's love when there are times that we recognize where a marriage [00:07:00] simply is dead.

What do we call that? Well, the name we give to that is di divorce. And, and, and when the, and when, when we actually, uh, go through the process of a divorce, we feel the pain and, and the mourning and all of those things that we would feel, uh, if, if just as though we'd lost a dear loved one, uh, to, to death.

Um, it, uh, is, you know, whatever there was is no war. And so divorce simply is our way of being truthful about that and making the possible. Making possible a new beginning, uh, for, um, for that couple. And the, the important thing to say in order for us to be consistent with our texts today and other teachings, is that we never pretend that divorce is simply, uh, just another choice.

It's not a lifestyle choice. It is tragic, it is sinful. It is us as a community. It is us as a couple missing the mark and, uh. And, and yet we, we claim the promise of, of our [00:08:00] confession that God nonetheless will be with us and continue with us as we rebuild our lives. And so divorce is aimed at making possible that new beginning.

So that's the doctrine of the church. And so I'm hopeful that with that little review. Uh, you can see that our, our, our understanding, this understanding is very consistent with what Jesus says here. And so with that, I'd like to step back from those details and just sort of hold onto that. Uh, and, uh, and now let's look and see.

So how does this conversation about divorce actually fit into the. Overall story that Mark is telling, why even include it? In order to do that, I wanted to ask us to pause now as my muse Sina, uh, reminded me that this weekend is a very poignant weekend for us. You know, we're yesterday, uh, we experienced the 20th anniversary of, of, uh, our, our, our tragic event called nine 11.

And, uh, and, and we, we've have, our [00:09:00] lives have been. Touched immeasurably, uh, since that moment as Americans, and not just as Americans, but as, uh, allies of Americans and, and also of those, uh, of, of the folks who are on the other side of what happened, nine 11. It, it has just been one of those events that has helped, has shaped human history in our time, uh, in ways that, uh, we are still feeling today.

And we at such times ask ourselves. How did that happen? How do we get ourselves into this situation? How do we get ourselves into a situation we're still dealing with the cancer, if you will, uh, that arose, uh, from the flames of nine 11. And, uh, I, I, I wanna ask you to just, uh, I know you've been reflecting it on all this weekend, but, but, but you know what that felt like and, and, and now pause for a moment and recognize that Mark.

Was speaking into a very similar situation. So I wanna remember the context of the Gospel of Mark for a moment. Remember, I, I've shared with you the Gospel of Mark was written at a time when they were [00:10:00] anticipating the destruction of Jerusalem. Uh, the, the Roman army had had been defeated by a band of rebels, of, of Jewish rebels.

And, uh, they had a small contingent. And so they just sent back for, you know, you know, the legions, uh, from Rome. And said, okay, we're gonna have to conquer, as we have always had to conquer those who oppose us politically. And so the, the armies were coming and Mark is writing in this period in which, uh, the Jewish people know that uhoh, what have we done?

Uh, we, we are about to get annihilated. And, and, and that's actually what happened, right in 70 in the year 70 in our common era. Uh, the, um, the Roman army just completely destroyed Jerusalem. And I think it's interesting in this rendering of that, of that event, I don't recall the painter here, but you see the folks, you know, being thrown off and jumping off the ledge as they were simply annihilated in Jerusalem.

The wa, the city of Jerusalem was, was [00:11:00] completely decimated. The population of the people who lived in the province of Judea, uh, was wiped out, you know, like a plague. Uh, you know, the, the great plagues of the world have, have, have typically wiped out about a third of the population when they arose. Well, for, for the people of Jerusalem.

This was like one of those disasters. About a third of the population was either killed or uh, taken off into slavery. Um, and, um, so whole peoples disappeared. The, the people who lived out in the desert, uh, the Essenes that we've spoken about before, completely wiped out. We see no more of them in history.

The Sadducees, who were the ones who owned the, the rights, the ones who had collaborated with. Rome, the ones who were the, the oligarchy who had run, uh, uh, ju ju uh, Judea, who had run the Jews. They were the kings of the Jews. You know, the, those Sadducees completely wiped out. No, no, no longer appear in the history of the world, right?

So this is truly one of those [00:12:00] pivotal events for them, like what we're experiencing. And, and one of the things that's interesting that happened was that Rome came in the. They, they, uh, they destroyed Jerusalem and then they weren't occupying a force a lot like we were in Afghanistan, uh, for a little bit longer.

Um, the, the 10th legions occupied it, it tend, it turns out that they, they did, uh, uh, uh, something that, uh, caused, uh, people to simply flee Jerusalem if you were Jewish. And so j the Jews. Um, um, fled. Uh, and one of the reasons they fled was because they, the, uh, attacks was imposed upon them, you know, the equivalent of two days wages every single year, uh, that was paid to the Pagan temple.

If you were a Jew, it only applied if you were a Jew. And if you wanted to practice Judaism, you could be allowed. But in order to be allowed, you actually had to financially support, uh, the pagan temples. And so, uh, just one of those measures by which the j the, the Roman people caused the Jews to flee the area so that they would no longer have the identity [00:13:00] that they would have.

So this was the context in which Mark was writing, and he's talking to Christian Jews. In saying, remember what Jesus taught us as this calamity comes about us. Don't get off the way. Don't be tempted to, uh, do as as you are. You are. Um, you know, uh, as it has suggested you do, you know, take up arms against them or other things.

Remember Jesus's teaching and stay. As one ruled by his rule, by God's rule. And, and, and, and so the big summary that we've seen so far in the preceding nine chapters is that first, the, the, the claim that, that don't worry, you know, Caesar, although he is the great pretender, is not in fact the king of the world.

No. Jesus the Messiah is the true king of the world. That's what chapter one was all about. And throughout the, the intervening chapters Mark has with his, with his, uh. Uh, been telling [00:14:00] us again and again that Jesus is the Messiah. That the day of the Lord has come, it's been inaugurated, that the kingdom of God has been inaugurated by him, and that God is going about the process of, of, of answering the prayers that we have held up in our exile, that God would deliver us.

So God is now delivering God's people. God is conquering the evil that we have. The evil that is, uh. Perpetuated upon us and the evil that we do, so that we might be reconciled with God and reconciled with all whom God loves. And then he and Mark's been saying all along the way that, that the way Jesus delivers you is through this invitation.

To be ruled by God's kingdom, to be, to let God reign in our heart. That's a very important point today. Uh, that, that God, that the invitation is for us to, to receive our deliverance by accepting the reign of God, uh, that that is being taught to us by Jesus the [00:15:00] Messiah, and being taught to us in something that we call the way, uh, we enter God's kingdom.

By walking the way and that way we've been talking about over the last several weeks is in fact, uh, the way of love. Over and over again. Jesus has shown us the way of the kingdom is the way of love, and most recently, in the last two chapters we've seen well that way of love is also something that we will now.

Come to know as the way of the cross because Jesus has just taught. The disciples, uh, begun to pivot towards Jerusalem and say that I will be going to the cross, that I will be tried and executed. And this is the means through which God will reconcile God's people. So he's just begun to teach them that.

So the, the way is how we enter into the kingdom. The way is the way of love. And that way of love is, it just is. If we wanna understand what it means to, to walk the way of love, well then we understand what it means to carry our cross as our prayers said today. So that's what's been happening. That's the [00:16:00] context of our lesson today.

That leads us to talk about this, this section here, uh, about divorce. And so, uh, now what has happened just before, unfortunately, in our. English Bibles, uh, publishers have introduced all sorts of things that the gospel writers didn't put in them, such as chapters and things like that. Those aren't in the, the Greek text whatsoever.

There's nothing like that. And, uh, that's all editorial, uh, rubbish. And sometimes it serves us and sometimes it doesn't help us at all. In this case, I would say we have a situation that doesn't help us at all because we're now in chapter 10. But, but there is. But Mark's story, the story he's telling right now is actually something that, uh, you know, we see in what we call chapter nine and continues into chapter 10.

It's all one big story. So let's recall what has just happened. Uh, at last week I spoke at length about, uh, this, what happened. When Jesus having descended, the Mount of Transfiguration, came down and discovers that, um, he, his, his, uh, [00:17:00] disciples are squabbling, they're fighting, you know, sort of like kids in the backseat, uh, you know, squabbling.

And he says, what are y'all fighting about? And they've been fighting about. Which of them is the greatest? Which of them besides Jesus is the greatest in the kingdom of God? And, and so Jesus, I wanna remind you, began to teach them and he said this very important thing, this, this, this lesson in humility, this lesson that when God reigns in your heart, well then you understand that whoever wants to be first, must be least of all, must be the servant of all I.

A very difficult thing for us to comprehend, as we said last week. And, and to illustrate this, I want you to remember he did, he did then, uh, what he does today. So our whole conversation about divorce and such is framed, uh, or bookended, if you will, uh, by, by, um. Jesus. Bringing a child, holding a child, and using the child as a [00:18:00] metaphor.

And I think that's to we to understand what he says. Uh, you know, the, the fact that he's bringing a child and using that child and, and a child as a metaphor for understanding his teaching, uh, is really pivotal to what we are, you know, how, how we're to understand. Why Mark is telling the story in this way.

So, so he, the first time they've just been squabbling about who is the greatest, and Jesus says, whoever welcomes one of these children in my name welcomes me. Now, remember we talked last week about a child was the absolute lowest individual. In the Kingdom of Rome, uh, lower with no political power with, uh, you know, child was, you know, was, is, was to be seen but not heard and, and preferably not to be seen.

You know, there was no sense of, of, uh, responsibility of movement in developing them. They, they were not to speak. Uh, so they, they were simply servants. Uh, they had no power. They were. They were completely powerless, which is sort of the point of Jesus's metaphor. To be powerful, you have to be [00:19:00] powerless like a child, he said last week.

And, and so, so he frames it last week. He, he, he, he teaches this, uh, about the children. Uh, this, this notion about being the least, uh, of all using a child's metaphor today. We see now. Mark says right after that conversation, the Pharisees came and they decided to test Jesus. And they, and they raise in order to test him a question, does the law allow a man to divorce his wife?

So the context of our story here is ge. Mark is telling us this thing about, uh, how we live in the kingdom of what it means to be the least of all. And in, and in the midst of that he chooses to. Insert this recollection of this Jesus being tested by the Pharisees on the question of divorce. Now why is that?

Why would Mark use this recollection to continue a conversation framed on either side by this Jesus holding a child and pointing to [00:20:00] the child as the way we can understand things. Uh, why would he do that? And so to 'cause at the end of his lesson today, after he finishes his conversation about divorce, Jesus is going to do the same thing he's gonna say.

Whoever doesn't welcome God's kingdom, like a child will never enter it. So divorce is somehow connected with this idea of welcoming God's reign like a child does. And if we can't welcome God's reign, the rule of God in our hearts, like a child does, we will never. Receive our eternal destiny to be forever in relationship with God, as we hope.

So what does all that mean? What is, what is Mark doing here? Uh, well, so let's, let's, uh, drill down a little bit and say why would for the Pharisees this divorce question be a te uh, a, a test for Jesus? And I just wanted to give you a little bit of important background here. The [00:21:00] first thing you need to know is that Roman law and Jewish law were different.

Uh, they, they had different understandings, Roman law, uh, but both of them permitted divorce and the Roman law only, uh, the husband can divorce, um, um, excuse me, under, under Jewish law only, uh, uh, the male could, could divorce, uh, at all. And, and, and that word divorce was simply dismissal. If you can think of the idea of, of, uh.

Of, of early pneumatic societies in which a male would have multiple wives. Well, the poss, you know, the, the male had within those societies, it developed the right to do simply dismiss a wife. And so the wife was no longer under his care, his protection, his protective care, um, uh, Roman law. Uh, was different than Jewish law because Jewish law said, well, that only a male could dismiss.

But Roman law did allow a female to dismiss her husband. But the other part of, of this illustration that's important is for us to [00:22:00] remember just three chapters, four chapters earlier. Mark has also hinted about this issue of divorce because he's talked, told us the story of how John the Baptizer, uh, was executed.

And if you re. Call it was the story of Odious. And John had taken on odious, inherit py. He had condemned their marriage. Uh, and if, if you recall there, the problem, uh, that he attacked was that Herods had divorced her first husband. These were the kings of the Jews, right? These were Jewish people who were not behaving according to Jewish law.

She simply set aside her husband, uh, who was Herod Antipas brother in order to marry the Herod Herod tpa. And that was a great scandal among the Jews, uh, because a woman, it wasn't a scandal as much of the, of the sexual. Scandal of an affair, but rather that here was a woman doing something that a woman wasn't allowed to do, to set aside her husband.

And that then generated a, uh, so we, we know [00:23:00] from the, the literature of the time, great arguments between the House of Al and the has of Shamil, uh, the, the two great parties of the, of the Pharisees, the political parties of the se, the Pharisees over divorce law. Right. But more importantly than that, interesting.

You know, in our story is what would Jesus do? Mark had just told us that the cost to John the Baptizer in condemning Herod's divorce was I. Death. He lost his head. His head was cut off given to the daughter on a platter. Right. So what would Jesus do if, if, if John the Baptizer was like Elijah to the Messiah, uh, what would the Messiah do?

Uh, when, when this question was brought before him? Would he, would he contradict John the Baptizer and save his head, or would he double down? And, and go along with, with John the Baptizers condemnation. [00:24:00] What would he do? Well, that was all context, you know, part of this drama. So we get this question, this text, and Jesus answered with a question as he often did, he said.

You asking me about divorce? Well, you who are experts in the law, tell me what Moses commanded in there. What is the mosaic law? What does it say? And they answered correctly. They said, well, Moses allows a man to write a divorce certificate and divorce his wife. That was exactly what I told you was the law.

So, so, uh, in, in, uh, Deuteronomy we see that that is written there and, but, but Jesus' response is, yeah, that's true. But he wrote this commandment for you because of your hardened hearts. He wrote this. Commandment for you. He enabled, he created the possibility of divorce because it was a necessity because of the way you sent.

And he [00:25:00] illustrated that by saying, the way we understand God's desires, not, not by looking at the Mosaic law so much, but looking at what preceded that, what God intended when God created us. So he goes back to the story of Genesis and he says at the beginning, God made them male and female. Because of this, a man should leave his father and mother and be joined together with his wife, and the two will be one flesh.

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, humans must not put us under what God has put together. And I, I wanna suggest to you today that I. That, uh, what Jesus is saying is, is really something quite profound. And, and this divorce thing is not Jesus saying, okay, let me now create a doctrine of divorce for, uh, for generations to come so they'll know how to handle, handle divorce.

No, he's giving us something much larger than that. He's telling us how to think about, um. God and begin with thinking with God's, uh, original [00:26:00] intentions for the way humans relate with one another and thereby to derive what our practices should be. So he, he brings us back. And so in the beginning he says that God created firsts.

How? Not males over females, but male and female. In other words, God did not intend for us to create a patriarchy in the, in the first chapter. That is not what we see with Adam and Eve. There was not a patriarchy, no woman wasn't given into the power of Adam in order to, uh, in order to then continue.

Adam's house in Adam's family line? No, they were co-equal in, in paradise. Uh, and then in, in fact, it says, uh, in, in the text, Jesus points out that, uh, that it is the man who leaves. The man. Doesn't, uh, you know, God didn't give us families in order to, uh, perpetuate the male, uh, family line, but rather man is to sever the man's.

Connections with his own [00:27:00] family and then go create something new. They become one flesh and something new is created. Uh, and the, and so, uh, a way for us to understand that first text in Genesis 1 27 is, is, uh, this, that. Those two persons, the first man and the first woman and derivatively, all of us have been created man and woman.

And when we are, when we marry, we enter into a common human life, a common communion, and, uh, and it's, and it's, it's one that is entered into, uh. As co-equals 'cause because that's how God created us. God always intended us to live male and female as equals. Um, and so God didn't create hierarchies of value.

And so what happens to us that, that, that, that through our hardness of heart, uh, that. Uh, becomes a reality are marriages that don't reflect this equal status. We, what we have [00:28:00] seen and what the, what the Mosaic law was intended to do is rectify the situation in which the marriage was no longer what God intended it was one serving the other.

Uh, it it is no longer a partnership in which each is serving the others channels of grace. It, it's, it's no longer. You know, a relationship in which, uh, the, the, the union itself is a sign and a manifestation of God's promised presence to us. No, it's necessary. Why in Jewish law, not because of the female's hardness of heart, but because of the males hardness of heart, this ability to.

Dismiss the female, uh, and to send her off into poverty. Uh, and so what it provided for in Jewish law was something that was intended to be very compassionate. This, this ability for a female to be liberated from a, a union in which she was being subordinated, uh, so that she, that God never intended, so that she.

Might [00:29:00] go and live again in the fullness of life that God intended. And Jesus says, after, after giving this teaching, after reminding this, you notice he doesn't overturn the mosaic law. He never says, you must not divorce. He says that God gave you the gift through God's instruction, through Torah of divorce because God understood this reality, this, this reality of, of the hardness of your hearts.

And so he wanted to create this, this, uh. Uh, liberating means so that, uh, the one partner, the weaker partner, in other words, the one who did not have any rights, uh, would be able to live in the fullness of life as was as God always intended. And so, having said all this, God summoned a child once again and he says this very interesting thing.

I assure you that whoever doesn't welcome God's kingdom, like a child will never enter it. That he hugged the children and blessed them. What are we to make of that? [00:30:00] Why does Mark frame this conversation back? You know, uh, you know, that begins with who among us is the greatest. Uh, with, with the story of children pointing us back to looking at how children accept the reign of God over them.

And what I wanna suggest to you folks is that children, uh, accept, uh, from the, from, from the time they're born. All persons. They, they're the ones among us who do not, who do not, uh, develop a mindset in which they see the world in this way. That is a false view of the world. A way in which everywhere they look, they see hierarchies of human value.

They see male in female hierarchies. They see. Brown and white and and black hierarchies of human value. They see all these tribal hierarchies of human value. God never intended that. And again and again in the Bible, we see God trying to break our habit of creating these hierarchies [00:31:00] and, uh. And, and Jesus is saying that the kingdom of God, uh, if you welcome the king of God, if you welcome God's reign in your heart, then you see the world, the way God sees it, which is male and female, co-equals you no longer see it, you know, according to these hierarchies.

And so what is the meaning of your baptism? Paul later will say, uh. In his letter to, uh, to the church at Galatia. He, he's explaining in chapter three, uh, what is the significance of your baptism? He, he takes this teaching that, that we see here in Mark and says, through this baptism, you have accepted, you have welcomed your identity, your God-given identity as God's children.

What does that mean? Well, it means that you now have been clothed with the Messiah. You wear. Those [00:32:00] royal robes in whatever identities that you have been taught to believe, those are no longer, there is neither ju nor nor Jew nor Greek. There are no more, no more of these tribal identities, these tribal hierarchies.

There is neither slave nor free, rich nor poor, in other words, nor is there male in female. None of these hierarchies are real. Any longer because through your baptism, you have made been, you have been given eyes to see the world as God sees it All are God's children. And when you live truthfully, you love all whom God loves.

You are one. As you see your neighbor as, as the Lord sees your neighbor. And so. God shatters these hierarchies of human value when we welcome God's reign in our lives. [00:33:00] That's, I think what we are to say today as we remember nine 11. Why do such things happen? Well, they happen because we persist in clinging to these hierarchies, clinging to these things that empower us.

Thinking that they give us security thinking that they assure our place in our society, our place, even with God, we clinging to them. Uh, and, and that, and yet the good news is that God is about the, the is is about the, uh, process of, of, uh. Pulling our fingers apart, uh, so that we let go of, of these things and recognize that we have no reason to cling to these hierarchies.

He's teaching us, uh, that, that, uh, we don't need to be at war with each other in the most fundamental places of our communities, such as our home, and we don't need to be. At war with each other in the most [00:34:00] fundamental, uh, places of, of our nationhood. Um, uh, because we are instead taught to walk the way of the love of love, which sees the other as God's beloved child.

And so whoever does not welcome this reign of God, like a child with that innocence that simply accepts God and accepts the other as a gift from God. That one will never enter. The Kingdom will never receive that hope for relationship that is eternal, that destiny, they are. They are blocking God's desire to hold them forever in God's hand by refusing to let God reign in their heart.

A very serious word here. I think folks a very serious word, and I think that's why, uh, that Mark takes this story about divorce and locates it [00:35:00] where he does. Who is the greatest among us? We're asking the wrong question. The right question is, how do I love better the ones that God has put in my midst?

The name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit? Amen.
