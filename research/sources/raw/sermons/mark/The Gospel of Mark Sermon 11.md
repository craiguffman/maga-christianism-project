# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 11

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we have, uh, some familiar stories as we continue our study of the gospel of Mark. I wanna remind you, uh, if you've been with us, you, you know, we've been, uh, studying Mark in a, a slightly different fashion, rather than focusing, uh, in the, in the. In the, uh, details of each and every small story.

We've been trying to step, take a step back and see what Mark was doing. Literarily, in other words, trying to look at his portrait that he's painting because he's, he's trying to answer a question for us and to convey something very important to us. The question that, uh, hopefully the spirit is leading us to ask ourselves.

And that question is, who is this Jesus? And, and perhaps a, a, a following question would be. How am I to respond to him? And so today we have this, these stories that are filled, filled with, um, with this, this story about bread and feeding in the wilderness. Now, one of [00:01:00] the things I shared with you last week is that one of the things that Mark did literarily is, uh, he.

Uh, starting in chapter four, uh, told this story, he painted this portrait using, uh, doublets, meaning stories that are paired. And last week we saw there were healings of, of, uh, that were within the Jewish community, of which Jesus was apart. And then there was. Uh, uh, a very similar story of healings that took place, uh, when they crossed to the other side.

When we crossed to the world that was unlike theirs. They crossed into the gentile world, but, but the, but the same kind of thing happened here again, we have. Two stories that are very similar, two feedings in the wilderness. And once again, mark has done the same thing. The first is a story that takes place within, within Na Galilee, within, uh, Jewish [00:02:00] homeland, within the community of, of the Jews, and the second.

Was a feeding in the wilderness, uh, that wasn't feeding Jews, but feeding the Gentiles once more. And again, very similar story. So what are we to make of it? Well, a couple points I'd I'd like to, uh, make before we dive in. Uh, just as a, as a reminder, 'cause I cannot help. Read this story without, uh, sort of a set of bifocals, uh, or, or, or, or hearing it with, with, in, in two different ways.

First of all, there's the story that is simply recalling what Jesus did in, in a mark recording, uh, the story of the disciples, you know, in and about, you know, 30 years, uh, you know, af after Jesus was born. And then there's the story that Mark is telling at to the community he's actually addressing. As they watched the Roman army, um, uh, descend upon Palestine as they, as they saw the [00:03:00] Jewish, uh, Roman war, uh, resulting in civil war among the Jews, and then they, as he, as he spoke into a community who was already feeling the pangs of famine and, and trying to understand how they were to flourish.

I can't help but hear it, uh, hear this story. Uh, with both of these, uh, historical backgrounds in mind. And the other thing that I, I, I hear it with and I'd urge you to consider is what the word bread actually means, biblically by the time Jesus arises. Certainly the stories, these stories, uh, evoke for us, uh, reminders of man in the wilderness and, and.

And, uh, and the food that God provided for people as they wandered feeling so lost, wondering would God be with them as they, as they made their way from Egypt into this land that God had promised? Um, certainly evokes that. But over time, this, you know, this bread, you know, man does not live [00:04:00] by bread alone.

Bread became a metaphor. For Torah became a metaphor for God's instruction, uh, on how to love God and love each other. Uh, because learning how to love is how we learn to live. Uh, biblically speaking, living to live is to love. To be fully human, is to love. So the bread that we need to sustain us is not merely.

Just, uh, that which comes from the grain, uh, that, that our stomach ingest. But it's also that, that that grain that our heart ingests Torah loving is what sustains us in bread, is learning to live in the way that frees us to love. So with that in mind, as we listen to these stories, uh, let's, uh, let's, uh, set the context.

First of all, uh, we haven't told the story yet, we'll come back to this later. At the beginning of chapter six, uh, Jesus has, has, they, they have [00:05:00] returned with, he's returned with the disciples across the Sea of Galilee. Uh, and Mark doesn't talk much about the, the return trip. But we suddenly find them back in Galilee.

And now Jesus having trained them sins, he gathers the 12 and he sends them out in pairs on their first solo missions. He instructed them, interestingly enough, and importantly to our story, uh, to take nothing for their journeys. Nothing except for a walking stick. In other words, they were to take no bread, no bags.

No money in their belts. So our story takes place upon their return. Uh, and so having sent them out, Jesus now teaches them to do what he always did, to withdraw, to withdraw into the wilderness, to draw to the mountain type. Top to pray to reflect on their experience and to learn from it. So they're basically doing debriefings as the, as these pairs returned and it says, many were coming and going and [00:06:00] there was no time to eat.

And then, and you know, this is supposed to be a treat. I don't dunno if you've ever gone on a spiritual retreat before. That was interrupted. Uh, I, being married to a, a, a surgeon, uh, who's on call this week, I've really felt the pathos a bit because, uh, uh, you know, on this, on this weekend alone, she had something like 18 calls yesterday of people, uh, just calling, calling, calling, just wanting someone to talk.

And so the, the, the description here is that these guys are, are, are. Are retreating to, uh, to, to reflect and to learn with Jesus so that they can be further prepared. But instead, the, the, the wilderness was overrun by crowds. The, and don't forget the word crowd that we see, that we translate the crowd that's we've been talking about.

That's the people of the land, the crowd consists of, of the masses of, in this case, Jews who, uh, were in and who, who were. Uh, chronically in need for, [00:07:00] uh, all the things that constitute bread that sustain us. And so, uh, they had moved. They had, they had moved, moved, followed Jesus and disciples into the wilder.

So they weren't actually able to do, uh, the, uh, restoration that was Jesus's intent. And the disciples look upon it and bond them in without quite the, the same eyes that Jesus did. They were. Wanting to get onto the project that Jesus has assigned them of reflecting. And instead, Jesus though looks upon them.

And the, I love the word that's there in the Greek, uh, uh, it, you know, we translate it in English to simply compassion, but the Greek word actually says Jesus looked upon them as one, having one's guts torn apart. As can you imagine having your gut torn apart? Jesus is is profoundly moved by the people of the land and, and their, uh, evident impoverishment.

Uh, this is not what his father intended. He knows and, and, and, and, but the disciples see [00:08:00] this too. And, and, and so when he says, let's feed him, uh, they say, okay, well, what that means is let's tell them to return to the circle of farms and villages to, to purchase food to. To, to take care of them. And, uh, and Jesus gives them a challenge.

He says, give them something to eat yourself, like Elisha did in our Old Testament story, the prophet did, and the disciples responded with something of astonishment in, in, in, in reproof, uh, actually a tone of reproving. Jesus, are you expecting us to, to, to take eight months of our pay to feed them? That's what it would take to feed this many people.

And Jesus says, well. Take a look. How much bread do you actually have? Isn't that a important point? Something a a point that we often forget to, to look and see what God has already provided and to, and to have eyes to see the actual superabundance that is there [00:09:00] and it's there. There's an irony here, don't you think?

Because Jesus had just sent them on a mission in which they were to take neither bread nor money, and they had been sustained along the way. One would think that they might have learned something from that experience. They, they had a failure of imagination. Twice they tell Jesus. That the solution is to go and buy food.

They, they had not enough faith that, that God would provide, but de Jesus takes this opportunity to teach them something new. Remember, he's about this project of now inaugurating, this new way of being, this new kingdom of God. So now they get lesson 1 0 1 and kingdom economics. So what did Jesus do? Well, the first thing he did is he provided order.

He established order. So he divided them into groups of As, as, as, uh, Chris read to us as hundreds and 50. So imagine them, they're, they're, they are seeded in the grass, all as though they were at a banquet table and they're organized into like banquet, like settings so that the food [00:10:00] could be distributed.

And then he took bread. Fish in his hands, he pronounced God's blessing, which is to say when we, when he blesses it, you, when we, when a, when a priest or when Jesus, you know, blesses something, they are putting this into, into, into service. So that, so that, uh, this thing that's in my hands when I pronounce a blessing on it's saying.

God, I, you know, I ask that you make this thing that's in my hands. You, you, uh, dedicate it and make it something that it is not apparently to me now, something more than a mere blanket, something more than a mere table. Something more than a mere loaf of bread in a fish. Make it something that will cause people.

To feel and experience your presence when they draw near to it, that's what it means to pronounce God's blessing and upon it. And that's what he did. And, and then he broke it into pieces. So he took it, he blessed it, he broke it, and then he gave it, he gave the bread to [00:11:00] his disciples. And then, uh, we read that all eight and we're satisfied.

I hope you recognize those four verbs. Take, bless, break, give, because those are the verbs that animate our own rehearsal of these Kingdom Ecno economics. Every time we celebrate the Eucharist, all eight, and we're satisfied. Not only that, just as the in prophet Salicious time. Uh, there was a surplus and a, and a surplus, uh, symbolically, 12 bushels.

There are 12 tribes of, of this reconstituted Israel, the 12 tribes, uh, and, and the 12 disciples that of Israel reconstituted. And there was a surplus such that there were bushels that filled. All of the 12 bushels symbolizing that God is providing, not just for those who are in the wilderness, but for all of Israel, so that they might be the people that God always called them to be.

So I, I mentioned the, the story of the prophet [00:12:00] Alicia and, and, uh, one of the things that was there, of course, in that the context there in two Kings. Uh, was, was there was famine in the land and starvation. Uh, so, so that's an important prophetic critique. And so Mark clearly is evoking that story and it provides the, the plot of his retelling of what happened in Jesus' time.

But, but another. The thing that he invokes here that we shouldn't miss is a, uh, is a critique of those who were called to be shepherds. There was a phrase that's in the prophets. It, it occurs in the prophet Ezekiel. It also, uh, occurs in the prophet Zechariah and elsewhere. This notion of a sheep without a shepherd.

It was, it was in, in context, very much a political critique. So I want to remind you of the words that Tom read to us is it's, it's God's judgment through Ezekiel saying, I'm going to judge between the rams and the books among the sheep and the goats. I'm going to [00:13:00] judge, uh, between the fat and the lean sheep, because with shoulder and flanking with your horns, you ram all the weak sheep.

Push them outta the way until you've scattered them outside you, you've made them outcast so that you can eat. But I will rescue my flock so they'll never again be prey for you. I'll even judge between the sheep and I'll appoint a single shepherd. A single shepherd, and he will feed him. Feed them. Uh, we see Mark.

Telling the story. I don't know how we can not remember this, this, uh, prophecy about the Messiah and what the Messiah would do, and see how Jesus is doing. Just that Jesus is acting as this single shepherd in feeding them as insisting that they be fed. But there's a prophetic critique here. I I, um, I had, uh, an interaction with somebody recently who began the conversation [00:14:00] by telling me that all taxes.

Theft. I want you to think about that a little bit. A worldview in which any sort of taxation on him and on anyone else should be understood to be theft, uh, from the government. Uh, and, and similarly, uh, in his, in his sense of things, I've noticed any proposed solutions to our. Racial and immigration tensions tend to be dismissed with words like Marxist or Communist.

And in other words, anything that looks like a sharing of the bread is to be dismissed and understand as theft from him. And, and I, I often wonder what underlies this thinking? Is it a, is it a, is it an understanding of these kingdom economics or is it an understanding of economics of some other kind? Um, is it an understanding of bread?

Uh, as of, of the same thing that we see in the Bible, uh, are, are, are another thing. One of the [00:15:00] things that I've, I've talked to him about is that freedom, uh, is learning how to love freedom, just is if you wanna be free. Freedom is not a private space in your head, uh, that, that no one is to. To invade or else be called thieves if they, if they, if they ask you to share bread, because God has provided all that is.

And freedom is about learning how to love. And in this story here, we see Jesus teaching us that love looks something like sharing our bread, sharing our bread with each other. There's a critique here that I hope we won't miss of, of the fat sheep, the lean, the fat sheep who, who, uh, jealously guard their bread and, and are unwilling to share and can't imagine figuring, you know, sharing with those lean sheep, but.

Mark, uh, then has [00:16:00] a doublet here. And that, uh, that doublet, uh, uh, occurs now later in chapter eight. So once again, Jesus has crossed the shore. He is gone to the other side, uh, to the, to the people who, for whom Israel was actually created. You know, remember the, the people of Israel were, were, were gathered.

By God in, in, in the, in the Book of Genesis to be a light to all the nations. Jesus is gonna enter the temple later and say, my house was intended to be a light for all the nations you were. The purpose was you were not chosen simply to be a people who lived in the promised land. No, you were chosen to live in such a way that all the nations, all my scattered nations, would be drawn into my love.

And so we see Jesus now enacting this repeatedly by having his ministry and then going to the other side, to, and, and seeing the, the folks who had been scattered, the people of the land, the poor of [00:17:00] the land who were not Jewish. And so that's what we see in this chapter, in chapter eight here, the Gentile.

People of the land this time, much like our Palestinians today, who have been, who have been persecuted in the Promised Land by Israel, uh, they, they, uh, people, the gentile people of the land who had, you know, had been gathered and they were without food and again. Jesus instructs them. He sees their hunger.

He sees the hunger in their, in their bodies and the hunger in their hearts. And he turns to disciples and instructs his disciples to feed them just as he instructs us to feed all of the people of the land. And, and we see the same words there. Jesus says, I am moved with compassion and is concerned that they will grow fate.

On the way, I wanna remind you that the way is, is the, is the way of love Jesus' way, the kingdom way. And [00:18:00] he's concerned that all these people have been gathered from the east and the West and the north and south. These gentiles who have been drawn into the way will grow faint on the way if they are not fed.

And so the Gentiles are described by Jesus as the scattered poor of Yahweh. Just as we read in Psalm 1 0 7 that Steve SKUs read to us, uh, this morning, some wandered in the desert waste to a city to dwell in, hungry and thirsty, their soul faltered within them. And once again, we see Jesus does the same thing.

He organizes them. He gives food for the food for the disciples to pass on, and he took. He gave thanks for it. He broke it and he gave, and once again, all eight and were satisfied. So we see here on in Mark's portrait, this wonderful, wonderful rendering of Jesus teaching us. How God actually provides the [00:19:00] bread of life.

And that bread of life is a, is a way, it is very much political because it's a way, it's, it's a way of, of performing kingdom economics. This, this sharing of all the means that God uses to sustain us.

You know, I had a conversation last night with my daughter Callie, and I gotta tell you, I am so excited. I've got one grandson I greet to you earlier today when we spoke about Father's Day, about my grandson is already born, but I got a grand fetus too, and my daughter Callie, and I'm excited. He's gonna be born in October.

Uh, and, and, and, but I, but I'm profoundly moved. As I think about it in a couple of ways, and I shared with some of you some of my concerns, my, my worries. I, I think of my daughter, Callie, Callie, as my eldest of, of my three daughters. Uh, and, and, uh, I, and I worry how it's going to feel for her. Uh, and I, I already see the evidence that it is, [00:20:00] that is a.

A difficult thing for her because this is one of those moments, one of those rites of passage that a, a daughter expects to go through with her mom and her mother's dead. And as her father who tries to be her mother, I, I worry how God teach me, teach me how to provide the bread that, that she needs. And I, and I think about this grandson who is to be born, and I wonder how, how, you know, what will sustain him.

You know, long after I'm gone and I was thinking all this, I. And, uh, and, and it, and it's all in the mix of having watched this movie. So Jean and I watched a movie that I, I really commend to you. I think it's marvelous. It's a, it's a work by Lynn Manuel Miranda, and it's showing in the theaters now. And, and on HBO Max, it's called In the Heights.

And it's a story I. Of, um, uh, the, the Latin community that has gathered very much people of the land of Spanish speaking peoples from Dominican Republic in Cuba and Puerto Rico and Chile and other places. And they've gathered and, [00:21:00] and have and established community beachhead in, uh, in the city, in New York City, in, in the place called Washington Heights.

And the story helps you to see the tremendous. Obstacles with which we, fat sheep have helped them, uh, live here, but only as lean sheep. We've prevented them from sharing in the blessings that you and I take for granted. These are persons of color. These are persons that, uh, are undocumented immigrants.

And they're hungry. But the beautiful thing about this story that I wanted to share with you, and this is in the context of thinking about my daughter, Callie and, and, uh, and, and, and this grandson who's to be born. There's this beautiful, uh, theme that recurs, uh, it's in Spanish, and I don't speak Spanish, so I apologize if I butcher it.

But the way I, there's a song actually about it. It's called

CIA and it means. Patience and faith, and, and, and they tell the story of [00:22:00] how each generation in Washington Heights had survived and they had survived by raising up in each generation leaders who passed on to them the bread that sustained them, even in times of famine. Cia. Ife God is with us in spite of appearances.

CIA ife. And so, so again, the, the word, the bread that they, that the folks needed was certainly the grain, but they needed this CIA ife. This word that sustained them so that they could keep walking, keep fighting for the respect that was their due, that's due for all Americans. But, but above all the teaching that they passed on was keep performing those small concrete practices that embody our human dignity in spite of all of those who deny it, and above all, keep loving each other by [00:23:00] sharing the true bread that satisfies whatever.

God has given you, whomever God gathers around you, whether you're in the city or in the wilderness. Take give thanks, break, and share with your neighbor in this practice. This practice is the bread. Feeds us. That's the politics of Jesus that sustains us brothers and sisters. I hope that we will practice this CIA IFE and pass it on to our children and grandchildren.

If there's one thing I hope that my daughter feels and in her solitude as she goes through this pregnancy and, and as I, as I. I learned to be a grandfather to this grandson who's coming. I hope that I will pass on this patience and faith that expects there to be a surprising [00:24:00] abundance already in the things that are right there before us.

This is the truth. This is the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen.
