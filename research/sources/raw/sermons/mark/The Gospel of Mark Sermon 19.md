# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 19

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we're gonna continue talking, uh, our way through the gospel of Mark. As you know, we've been doing a close reading, a, a close reading in which we've tried to understand the gospel of Mark in a literary way, that is to say, as a work of art. And today we enter a, a new section of Gospel of Mark last week and in a very.

Important section of, of the gospel for us today. Uh, we, we talked about the story of the transfiguration, and we talked about the time when the, the de the disciples dis after they descended the mic. Uh, the, the mountain of transfiguration. They discovered the disciples had been incapable of, of, uh, doing an exorcism.

And Jesus, uh. Uh, had had told 'em. The problem was that they did not have sufficient faith. So we talked about that this last week. Today we talk about a very interesting story, and what we are gonna see now is that Jesus over the, uh, mark in Mark's gospel, uh, mark is going to include stories in which Jesus is focusing now.

On a [00:01:00] new task, whereas before he was going about, uh, the province of Galilee and, uh, in certain hellenized uh, portions of Palestine, uh, preaching the, the, the, the gospel proclaiming the, the establishment of the kingdom. Now he is going to pivot a, a a bit and now focus on. The task of catechesis, that is to say the ca the task of teaching his disciples how to be the community that he has called in into, uh, into existence.

And, and if we were to ask ourselves, well, why did Jesus pivot in that way? Well, the answer is pretty clear because now he is telling them, he just told them in our, our last couple of readings, uh, and once again in our reading today, he's telling them. That the human one who Jesus has identified as himself, uh, is going to be, uh, tried, uh, and crucified.

Uh, you know, he'll be rejected and therefore it'll be the task of the disciples to [00:02:00] carry on that work. And so now Jesus is preparing them for that by teaching. So we're gonna get a lot of. Ethical teachings about how to be the community, uh, to be that fellowship, uh, that is, that will be the hands and, and, and feet of Jesus.

So, so that's where we are today. So we, that, that, I, I mentioned that as background because, um, we. We, we are gonna really encounter three questions today for the community. Questions that Jesus knew that they were going to struggle with questions that they were already struggling with. Uh, and, and, uh, I wanna take each of these, uh, one at a time.

The first one really is how do we know if what we're doing is what you taught Jesus? How do we know, uh, that we are on the way? How do we know if the actions that we want to do or that we actually already are doing are what you. Call us to do. You and I might ask the question, how do we know if what we're doing is Christian?

Or not? Pretty [00:03:00] important question, is it not? It's a very important question If we are, are taking seriously our identity as Christians? And the second one was, how do we think about, uh, things that we hear from people who are not Christian? How do we think about people, uh, about the good that is done by those who don't walk with us as Christians?

How do we, uh, even interact with that? And, and a related question, uh, how do we think about the bad that's done within our inner circle, within the eucharistic circle, within the, the set of Christians, people who who claim to believe the same things that we believe, who are trying to do the same walk, that we're trying to walk, to go to the same destination, the summit of, of of, of the, of the Mount Jerusalem.

You know, what do we do about the badge that we ourselves do as we strive to walk? The way, how are we to be that community when that is actually a factor of our life? So we're gonna deal with each of those, uh, today, uh, as Jesus, uh, begins to teach the disciples. And the first one is what constitutes the [00:04:00] way.

And it's an interesting, uh, way that Mark introduces this topic in the gospel because he tells us there's this story about the. Disciples and, and the first thing that we see is that after they've come down from the, the amount of transfiguration, uh, Jesus and his followers went about Galilee. But, but Jesus didn't want the rest of Galilee to know it.

In other words, mark is telling us that now they've entered into a new era, they are fugitives 'cause Jesus expects to be arrested. Uh, and, uh, he expect so, so they, they were, they were going about, uh. Palestine, but they were avoiding the crowds. Now it's a new stage, a new, a new thing happening in their lives.

And so they ended, they went back to, what was Jesus' headquarters? Uh, likely it was Peter's home at, uh, Capernaum and they went into a house and he, and he turns to them much like I've, I've heard my wife do before with, uh, some of the ins of theirs. What were you talking about? I overheard you sitting in the front seat.

Uh, and I loved, I loved the [00:05:00] way that Chris read it 'cause he sounded like he had had the same experience that that. That I had, the way he emphasized that, you know, what were you arguing about during the journey? You know, I've got this gene always tells the kids that she's got, you know, mo a mother's eyes in the back of her head so that she can see whatever it is they're, they're doing.

And so she, she, she'll turn around and, and nail them and What were you talking about? Tell me, I wanna know now. And so, Jesus, who does that to the disciples. And, and, and of course, remember the disciples aren't the 12, the disciples are all the, the people who are following all the people in the flock. And, and, and a, and a group of these were called.

These were the ones that were, uh, put into leadership position. So, so, uh, they, they didn't respond because they were embarrassed. I assume he didn't say that, but it says they didn't respond because they knew what they were doing was not gonna be well received by Jesus. They were arguing about who was the greatest.

Isn't that an interesting question? Have you ever asked that question yourself? Have you ever wondered, I, for me, this question reminds [00:06:00] me of a, of, uh, something that's just simply the Bible tells us, uh, from, from the Old Testament, from the story of Exodus, I mean of Genesis. Uh, it's sort of a, it's, it's part of the human condition for us to ask, well, who among us is the greatest?

You know, that was the question with which Cain struggled. Right? Cain the one who slew his brother Abel. Why? Because he thought that, well, God loved. God preferred able to him. Right. And, and it's a, it's a question that many of us will ask. Who's the best? Who's the strongest? Who's the fastest? Which one of us does mom love the most?

Which one of us is favored by dad? In other words, what we're really asking here and disciples are really asking when they say, which among us or who among us is the greatest? You know, given that we are Jesus's followers, they're really asking us. Which one of us should be the most secure in our relationship with Jesus in our relationship with God?

Which one of my, which one of which one of us, uh, should feel most at peace about our [00:07:00] future because, man, we're just nailing it. We're just doing everything right. Uh, uh, we are worthy. We are, which one of us is the most worthy? Right. I, I've heard, uh, this question, it's a, it's a question that children ask, right?

You know, which one of us. Is the greatest. And Jesus hears that question and he gives 'em an answer. I think they perhaps did not expect He pull, he called together the 12, whenever Jesus calls together the 12, that's a, a signal from Mark that says, listen up. Jesus is about to, you know, have a come to Jesus moment, literally.

Uh, and he says to them something that's, uh, must have been quite astonishing to them. I, I, I said this today to s severe as he and I were. Uh, debating over who's gonna go first in the microwave. Uh, uh, whoever wants to be first must be least of all in the servant of all. And I imagine the disciples, uh, responded a little bit like, uh, my little buddy.

Huh? What does that mean? You see, that's not natural to [00:08:00] us. It doesn't make any sense to us. Whoever wants to be first. Must be least must be the servant That's counterintuitive to us. It, it's something we have to learn. It's, it's something that we have to be taught. It's something that has to be modeled.

It doesn't make sense. We don't get why we should even believe that kind of approach to life. We have to see it and understand why. That might make a difference in our lives, and that's what Jesus strives to do. So what did he do to, to emphasize his point? Jesus reached for a little child. And he placed them among him among the 12, and he embraced them.

Now, I want you to think for a moment about this. You know, Jesus is, is doing something that is incredibly counter-cultural for us in our time. You know, many, many, many centuries after Jesus lived. This is not such a big deal to, to, to bring a child among a group and place [00:09:00] attention upon a child. But in Jesus's, uh, culture, in Jesus' time.

That would've been an astonishing thing for him to do because you didn't put attention on children in his era. And I'll say more about that in a little bit, but then he says something that's really interesting. He says, whoever welcomes one of these children in my name. Welcomes me. So, so, so when you, when you are welcoming this child, when you are nourishing this child, you are nourishing me.

And then Jesus says even more than he says, and whoever welcomes him isn't, isn't actually welcoming me, Jesus, but rather the one who sent me. In other words, when you welcome a child, you are welcoming God. When you're welcoming a welcoming a child, you are welcoming the one who sent Jesus. The one we call the one Jesus called the Father, the one who teaches us what it means to be mother, the one who teaches us what it means to be fully human.

Isn't that interesting? [00:10:00] Jesus chose when asked to, to, to, to, when, when, when, when. Trying to teach the disciples what it means to walk along the way. He chose to bring a child and make the child the very symbol I. What a radical thing that must have been socially in his time. You see a child in, in the, in the era of, of the Roman Empire, was at its very best chattel property.

A, a, a thing. Something that was, was not to be a cherished at all. Something that was just another mouth to feed. It was a, it was a responsibility, but not something, uh, in which there was gr uh, all sorts of literature talking about how we love and care for children. No, they were non-entities. At most, they were supposed to serve all, and they were, and this is I think, the most important point.

A child in Jesus' time was at the very bottom of every ladder, [00:11:00] even below adult women, even below. Slavery who were above women in his time in the hierarchy. Um, the children were the epitome of powerlessness, and this is the symbol that Jesus chose to use in illustrating what he meant by the way. And so what is it that we are to learn from this?

What constitutes the way? I, I don't think we can understand this without taking in the whole conversation that Jesus has been having about the way of his walk was to go and to give his life for all right. Um, the way, when we talk about the way that's a shorthand in Mark's gospel, the way, uh, first of all was the name of the group.

I don't know if you knew that. Uh, in, in, in, in the first century, the Christian, the first name we know that was given to. Early Christians was the way they were called the way, because they followed the way that Jesus thought, which was the way of the cross, which was the also, as we understand [00:12:00] it, the way of love.

So what did that mean? Well, let's drill down a little bit into that. What, when we talk about following Jesus's way, what we're talking about is following this way of powerlessness, this way of the child, this way, uh, of, of innocence in which we try to, uh, manifest fully, uh, our humanity. By offering it, by giving it up, by, by offering ourself like Jesus did on the cross.

Jesus went to the cross, sacrificed himself, gave himself so that you and I might be, uh, capable of being in relationship with God, might be reconciled to God. Well, that's what we do too. We, we offer ourselves in that same way in service. Why, so that others might also be reconciled with God and all that God loves.

In such a way, we are aligning ourselves with God's mission, right? We are being [00:13:00] Jesus', living hands, Jesus's living eyes. We are carrying on that fellowship, that work, that, that, that fellowship of sufferings that Jesus commissioned, that is his way of saving the world. And so. As we are navigating our lives, we navigate the way by seeking not to see if we are the greatest, not to show that we are the fastest not to show that we are the best.

Not to be the most powerful, but rather to be one whose very mission in life is understood to be reconciling God's cre creation to itself to be a part of, of that theo drama. That to, to reconcile means to bring together. Back. In other words, to bring back together. Uh, that's what, so, so, so God is doing that on the cross.

God is bringing back together, bringing, we were once in the, in the beginning, completely united in fellowship with God. Then we became estranged because of [00:14:00] our sin. We became separated for because of our sin and on the cross God acts to bring back together. And so when we navigate the way we are doing that same thing we're trying to bring back together.

All of God's created order. And we're trying to do that with every ounce of our energy in every second of our lives. And we have another way of talking about the way of Jesus. And we call it the way of love. And I think that's actually just another way of saying the same thing, because what is love? But that which drives toward the reunion of the separated, right?

We've talked about that understanding. When we love someone, we don't have some sort of sappy Hollywood. You know, red, you know, hearts and chocolate box of chocolates kind of sentiment. No. Loving is acting love. Love is action. Love is when you get up off your tail and you go do something that's gonna bring about the reunion of, of, of God's creatures that are, that need [00:15:00] reconciliation.

Whether, whether it's God's creatures who are humans like. Like two, two adults, two children, lots of you know, families, uh, you know, trying to reconcile that brokenness are our estrangement from the created order from animals and, and, and, uh, and, and the like. So love is that which, uh, drives towards the reunion of that.

So what does it mean to, for us to walk along the way? Well, it means that we give up, we abstain from. Power. We have lots of power. We accrue lots of power, uh, in our lives, uh, through, through just growing up and, and becoming more mature. And as we become more powerful, well, how do we exercise the way? How do we stay along the way?

Well, the, the, the paradox is we abstain, we refuse to use that power to make ourselves greater, but rather we use, uh, that power by giving it up. By giving it up so that we might bring back together those who need reconciliation so that all of the created order all creatures might [00:16:00] have a possibility of carrying forward.

So in our family dynamics, that looks like when we see brokenness, we give ourselves to the purpose of figuring out what act must we do in each and every moment. So that we can transform the dynamics of our family when we, so we can transform, uh, the dynamics of our relationships with our neighbor, with our, with, with our, uh, those who, who, uh, who live in our community.

But, uh, but don't even acknowledge us as neighbor. We're constantly going about that process. That's the way. So if that's the way, how do we think about the good that we see? From those who don't even think of themselves as walking along the way. Now, I've heard this question many times. Uh, it's phrased, been phrased by some of you, Hey, what, how do I even think about the Jews?

I'm a Christian. What, how do I think about the Jews? How do I think about Muslims? That's been a big question in our country. What's gonna [00:17:00] happen to them? What about the Hindu? Um, and what about all these atheists and agnostics that are in our society today? What's gonna happen to them? What's the. What's the, the, what is their destiny and how do I think about the things that they do?

Is it are they are, you know, is there, are they inherently evil? Should I stay away from then? They're so different. What am I to do? I've heard that question honestly, from about every person I've ever spoken to in any sort of. That from faith. It's a question that arises for us, and it's a good question.

It's a natural question. And there's another question I hear an awful lot, uh, but not fortunately from everybody, but from lots of folks who are anxious about, I think, their own standing before God. And they'll, they'll, they'll say things like this, everyone who doesn't get baptized and join the church is gonna burn in hell, right.

'cause that's what they've been told. And they've hope they, sometimes it's because they hope that they've made the right choice and they're, they're going about and they wanna make sure that those other folks [00:18:00] are, that they're seeing who are living differently, uh, are gonna get what's coming to 'em. Right.

Uh, so it's a, it's a very different question, but it's a similar question. And the reason, uh, that, that I bring this up is 'cause Jesus dives right into that and Mark presents it in, in what happened. Uh, you know, with Jesus' disciples, after they were talking about the greatest, they started talking about those who even weren't, weren't even in the circle.

Now we do this an awful lot. Um, I, you know, it, it's not just, uh, you know about Jews and Hindus and, and, and, uh, Muslims and atheists, you know, for, you know, we ourselves, within our community have decided along the way. There's all sorts of people that we think. You know, uh, going to hell. And so I've given you a list there of many, I'm not gonna read all of them that we have consigned to hell for, for, for, for not doing things the way we do them.

You know, uh, we've, we've, uh, we've, you know, we've decided for example, that those who, uh, commune with leave [00:19:00] to bread. Are going to hell. And, and another group has decided those who use, uh, uh, unleavened bread are going to hell. You know, uh, we, we have decided that, uh, those who don't believe in evolution, uh, uh, rather who, who do profess evolution are going to hell.

We, we, we've said that, uh, those who don't. Uh, seem to be civilized, uh, like us. Well, they're savages, and so we know their destiny. They're going to hell. Uh, one of my favorites is the one about singing that I've listed there. You know, along the way throughout our history, we have had Christian groups who have consigned to hell, those who sing in church at all.

Those who sing in church by. To allow any singing in church by someone who is not the authorized cantor. Those who allow singing that's not in the form of a Gregorian chant. In other words, bring in some sort of musical instrument like an organ we've consigned to help those who, uh, sing non Psalms in church.

We Episcopalians rioted in the city of New York because the first Episcopal church started, uh, a Episcopal [00:20:00] church, started singing songs that were not. Psalms. Um, and, and we, we, we, uh, right now consigned to hell bows who, uh, sing songs that are not authorized by the church properly. You know, they're these songs that, uh, uh, perhaps are contemporary Christian music songs like Amazing Grace was, was, uh, uh, you know, generated many letters that said that anyone who sang it in church would be going to hell.

Uh, and, and many of us today, uh, I've heard some of you guys consign to hell, or maybe you were just describing it as hell, to have to listen to someone singing with drums and guitars in church. You know, we do a lot of this consigning to hell. Why? Because people are trying to go about worshiping in a different way.

And so the one that's I think a little bit more poignant. A little bit more personal and a little more painful for us most recently, uh, is that, that, uh, we, ourselves, as Episcopalians have been told we're going to hell by those who don't get why we ordained women by those who don't get why we welcome our brothers and [00:21:00] sisters who are gay or lesbian as priests.

Why, why we, um, you know, going way, way, way back, why we baptized folks who were non-white. I. Uh, we've been consigned to held by many and still are by many in our time, and most recently. It's something that's very pertinent now given what's happening in the state of Texas with regard to their abortion laws.

You know, uh, those of us, like our church who claim women have a right to choose to terminate a pregnancy that it's, uh, it's not the state. Role to do that, but the woman's role to do that? Well, there are an awful lot of our fellow Christians who had said, Hmm, for holding that belief. They know exactly where we're going.

We're going to hell. So I just wanna make sure that we remember some of those because that, uh, makes, it shows that we're really not that different from the first disciples. You see, mark records a story about John now, John doesn't. Bear too. Well in today's gospel, he, he, you know, he's the beloved one in his own gospel.

But in Mark's gospel, he is the one who, uh, gets corrected by [00:22:00] Jesus today. So John went to Jesus said, teacher, you gotta do something, man. We saw someone throwing demons out in your name. We tried to stop him because he's not one of us. He's not following us. Gotta do something Jesus. And what's really interesting is that Mark is recalling this in such a way and recalls Jesus' language in such a way that he evokes a very similar moment that we see in, uh, the, the, the, the five books of Moses, the, in the book called Numbers.

Uh, we recall the story in which Joshua acted like John, you know, Joshua. Uh, comes to, to Jesus. I mean, I mean, excuse me, to Moses. Uh, and, and, and acts sort of like John did. You see there was a man who, who ran up to Moses and said, uh, that someone is prophesying in the camp. And Joshua's, uh, uh, Joshua went up to Moses and said, Moses, you gotta stop them.

And Moses said to him. [00:23:00] Are you jealous for my sake, if only all the Lord's people were prophets with the Lord placing his spirit on them. We could do with a lot more of that kind of folk. That's pretty much what Moses said, and that's pretty much what Jesus said. Jesus replied, don't stop him. No one who does powerful acts in my name.

Can quickly turn around and curse me and then he says, that's a very important point to us today. Whoever isn't against us is for us. I assure you that whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will certainly be rewarded. So how do we think about the good done by those who don't walk the way?

I just want to derive a few suggestions from this text here today. The one thing I I think that stand out to us is that whenever we think of the church as an exclusive club for Saints, we're on the wrong path. Our exclusivity. Our sense of exclusivity is though [00:24:00] we are in an in some select group, we are people that are chosen and those are the people who are not chosen.

Well, we're getting that wrong. Contrary to popular opinion, the church isn't an exclusive club and we don't have a monopoly on the good and the important point, I think the important principle here that helps us to think about Muslims and Hindus and Jews and atheists, et cetera. Is to remember this point that that which brings back together, that which reconciles the estranged is intrinsically good no matter who's doing it.

And we should praise God for the good they do. So we're, we have so much more in common. With our Muslim brethren, our Hindu brethren, our Jewish brethren, our atheist brethren. Brethren, then we have not in common. We have so much to celebrate together and certainly we can celebrate any good that they do because they, the good they do is good for us as well.

And then again, [00:25:00] again, we can't, I wanna make sure you don't miss the humor in this. I mean, Jesus is saying this and he's correcting me. But, but you gotta think, he had to have been thinking this, John, you're, you're complaining about them, uh, exercising, uh, uh, demons, aren't you? The guy who just last week couldn't do a decent exorcism because of your own faith deficit.

Yeah, that's right. John was one of them who was unable to do one of those exorcisms, and yet they're complaining about others doing those exorcisms. Just a bit of humor there from the gospel of Mark. And that leads us to the third tough question here. How do we think about the bad that is done by those of us who are actually striving to walk the way?

Very important question. You know, when I think of. Of, uh, our young kids, uh, you know, they, these are the questions that, uh, parents really concern themselves. What do you do? You know, syn, when someone starts to lead you down a path that's completely inappropriate, [00:26:00] uh, for someone your age, you, how are you going to.

To know what to do. You know, this is very relevant question for someone at that age. It's a very relevant question for my, my adult children. It's a very relevant question for all of us who are in our golden years. What do we do? How do we think about the bad? That's being done among people that are supposedly like-minded.

Those ones that we love. They can be our family members even. What are we to do when they have, we have these very difficult situations. Jesus tells us something that's pretty tough. It's some tough learning here. He says, as for whoever causes these little ones who believe in me to trip and fall into sin, it would be better for them to have a huge stone hung around their necks and to go be thrown into a lake.

Think about that. It would be better for them to die, be to be drowned than to be the [00:27:00] cause of one of these little ones. And causing them to, to depart the way being responsible for this. So let's talk about that a little bit. In the Bible, Jesus will have this, this little ones will be something of a double entendre.

First of all, it is literally the little ones, the child, the children, right in front of him. But the word that is used there was also the word that was used to describe, to name those people who had come into the church who were coming in to be catechized. They were adults. But they were new in the faith.

And if you remember what it's like to be new in the faith, you know, your, your head is so full of questions and, uh, a lot of the habits that you're being asked to follow are new and it's so easy to stumble. And it's particularly this group who are, who have finally. Gotten, you know, off the, you know, they, they, they figured, you know, finally gotten on the wagon, so to speak.

They've gotten on the way and to be the one who's responsible for them falling off the wagon for departing from the way, [00:28:00] wow. Uh, that is a really bad thing to do. It's a horrible thing to be responsible for. Jesus is saying here, and, and he says something that's really important. He gives us a, a, a series of, of, of, um, of metaphors here, you know, the hand and the eye and the foot.

And, and the, and the syntax is pretty much the, the, you know, the same in each one of these sentences, he basically says, if your hand, eye, or your foot scandalizes, you then remove it for, it's better to enter life without it. Then to be thrown into Johanna with it. So it's better to be without it than to be with it and end up on your, your, your way to Johanna.

So we're gonna, we're gonna break that down a little bit here, but, uh, the important point, uh, the first point is that, let's talk about what that word scandal means. I've shared the Greek with you there so that it, you know, uh, you know, the, the, the, uh. You know, the, the English text translates that [00:29:00] into, you know, uh, you know, causing you to fall into sin.

That's actually not what the text says in Greek. The Greek in text actually says it uses the word that we, you know, literally scandalized. Um, which, which is a technical term that Mark uses in his gospel every single time. It's in the same way. So we understand what Mark means by this. He's, it, it better, it would be better translated if someone causes you to read.

Reject the kingdom message. If someone causes you to desert the way, well then it would be better for you to remove the cause. Remove the thing that is causing you to reject the message rather than to stay with them. And. Uh, end up yourself on the way to Gehenna. So let's unpack this a little bit. Jesus gives a quote, we need to talk about what Johanna is.

Jesus quotes Isaiah, the very end of that very famous book, Jesus's favorite book of you know, that he would ever quote the prophet Isaiah. There's a place where worms don't die [00:30:00] and the fire never goes out. You heard this read to you. When we read the Old Testament reading, when Steve Burrows read the, the Old Testament reading, this was the end, the very last words of the prophet Isaiah.

The, you know, the, the, uh, uh, the last three, four or five verses. Uh, where, where the last two verses, well, actually the last verse. You know, we, we see that language Jesus is quoting where the worm never dies. But let's remember in context what that word, what that, that, that. That, uh, metaphor was about at the end of the prophet Isaiah.

Uh, the prophet is celebrating what God is doing. He is celebrating God's deliverance of God's people from exile, and he's, and he's, and he's, he's prophesying of an of the, of the. In times of he's prophesying about the day of the Lord and when the day of the Lord comes, all the world has been gathered as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making will endure before me.

So your descendants and your name will [00:31:00] endure, and so you and you will worship with me. In other words, he's describing the reconciliation that God is bringing about. God is bringing back together those who have been exiled, bringing back together those who have been estranged from God and from each other.

That is the work that is God, that God is doing. And God and, and the prophet Isaiah talks about that people will be gathered together and they will still see. They will still remember and see the corpses of those who rebelled against that effort. Who, who, who opposed God's effort to reconcile. All of the created order to God and those people will have a fire that will never be extinguished.

In the context of this is, is that we're all salted with fire, but there is a fire that God will, will put out. There is a, there is a peace that God will give those who worship him. There will be that peace that stills our hearts, the still waters will be there, but for [00:32:00] those who. Oppose God who, who, who refused to accept the gift of, of God's deliverance.

Well, they will experience this fire never being put out. It will never be extinguished. They will never have that peace, that joy they will have, uh, life that is like, uh, a, you know, a worm that never dies. And so that is an eschatological symbol. And so that it's important for us to understand. It's translated as ena, that's the word that's in the Bible, in the Greek ga Hena, which was a, a burning, uh, rubbish pile that was near Jerusalem in later years.

Not at the time of, of, of the prophet Isaiah, but in Jesus' time. Uh, and so that word is, is the one that we, in our English bibles, translate into hell. So what does that word hell mean? We get confused by it because we live after John Milton and his book Paradise Loss, which made us all see it as a literal.

Thing, but hell was never that biblically hell was understood as an eschatological symbol that you see here. [00:33:00] And it's English word that we use to describe the life of those who rejected this deliverance, that the prophet's talking about this deliverance by God. In other words, they reject grace. They refuse to be reconciled by God.

This, this grace. They refuse that. And so what do you call the life of someone who chooses not to have their heart made, made peaceful again? The word that we give to that is hell. And so Jesus is saying something quite important here. He's, he's saying that it'd be better to be without, uh, folks that are leading you down that path.

It'd be better to, to be free of them. So let's talk about Mark's context and remember that for a second here. It's, it's right at the end, right before the fall of Rome. Remember the, you know, uh, the Jewish people have rebelled against Rome and the Roman army is coming to wipe them out. That's actually what does happen.

But Mark's written when that is about to happen. And there are pilgrims happening in Rome itself, and there are [00:34:00] many Jewish Christians and Jews who live there, who are now. Experiencing, uh, state mandated pilgrims against them. And what you see is them, uh, like we see ourselves and we, we see in other lands when we have gone into them like Iraq.

Uh, those, those people, uh, dividing among themselves and following different warlords who are all promising them different ways of deliverance. That's what happens in Palestine. Palestine gets divided among four warlords, and this is, this is where the people of the Jewish Christians are all living, that Paul's writing to.

And they're all being told to go live in this way, live in that way. And, and one of them is telling, uh, the Christians to take up arms against Rome and take up arms against their fellow Jewish Christians who you know, and, and join the arms of the rival parties. And, and so and so doing, they're being taught to live in a way that Jesus, uh, didn't teach them.

And that's the context that Mark is seeking to address in this story. And I think to put it in our own context, you might [00:35:00] ask yourself. Have you ever been told that you need to join in someone else's war against someone in your own family? Someone in your own school group? Have you ever been told, ah, come join with us.

We're gonna stay away from her. Have you ever experienced the schism in your family where, where the, where the object is to isolate one or, or at work or, uh, have, have you ever been, felt those pressures where you have been invited? To behave in a way that is contrary to what Jesus has taught us. This way of bringing back together those who were separated.

Well, if, if so, this word ought to speak to you very clearly. I. So what, what does Jesus teach us in this take? In this case, he says, don't let those who reject the kingdom message or depart the way lead you off the way. Don't let those people who are intent on schism, on intent [00:36:00] on war, um, on intent, on violence, lead you to forget the way that Jesus taught us this way, uh, in in which we reject God's deliverance, reject.

God's efforts to reconcile us by actively acting in, in a, in a way, a manner of violence. It's better to accept their choice, the other person's choice of being violent, and allow them to go on, on their own way, to walk apart as they desire, than to walk with them in order, just in order to remain with them.

And so you have this saying, it's better to be, you know, without your arm. Without your leg, without your eye. That is actually a liberalizing. Understanding, you know, the capital offense, uh, that was apostasy, was punishable by death. And so when Mark is saying it's better to be without your arm, it's, it's talking about doing something that's less than capital punishment, uh, but still preserves you so that you can continue on your life.[00:37:00] 

But does that mean that we choose permanent estrangement? And then Jesus says these additional words. Salt is good, but if salt loses its saltiness, how will it become salty again? Maintain salt among yourselves and keep peace with each other, and so that, that phrase probably doesn't mean a lot to you. So I wanna share, you know, the share with you, the fact that that's very much a, a biblical metaphor.

The word salt and the way it's used there, you know, comes from several sources. In Leviticus, it's a, you know. Do not admit the salt of your g of your covenant with God from your grain offering. Uh, do you know that Lord, God of Israel gives the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of salt?

So salt was a metaphor biblically for fellowship, for fellowship with God and each other. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a sign is a symbol of our covenant to live in this way of, of reconciling life with God. And so what Jesus seems to be [00:38:00] saying is that. We're not to reject, uh, we don't, we're not to let those who are trying to lead us off the way lead us off the way.

We still have to maintain our nonviolent posture. Yet it's important that even as we allow folks, uh, who are, who are, who are going on the wrong path to go on the wrong path without us in words, we're to separate ourselves from this and just say no to their, their ways of violence, their ways of, of unreconciled behavior.

Even though we are for the time will be separated from them, it's not to be a permanent separation. The hope is always that we will continue working towards resolution of that conflict. 'cause the goal is that no one have a fire that burns perpetually in their heart. The goal is for everyone to have the peace that God desires for us all.

And so our. Our mission as Christians is to say no, but to, to so hope that that is a temporary no, that those folks who walk astray will come back to us [00:39:00] and we're to always be working towards that resolution. So here's the good news folks. The way is the path to the still waters that we seek. It's the way we find that peace and unity that makes our lives filled with joy.

Yet our exclusivity has its limits. It doesn't matter who does the good that we seek. We're called to celebrate it all. All the good, all the truth, all the beauty from whatever source. We're free to do that. It's not a sign of disloyalty to Jesus to welcome the beauty of poetry from a Muslim, and our inclusivity has its limits.

We are called to say no. To our fellow Christians who invite us to get off of this way of love. And that does happen. But when that happens, we're called to do it just in the sense of giving them a timeout, giving them time away, uh, until they come back to their senses and deduce that they, they actually need this way of love [00:40:00] for themselves to have the peace and love that God desires for all.

So we're never to stop working toward that end. Folks, this is the good news. May we. Spread it to all we know and live it in all we do. In the name of the Father and the Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.
