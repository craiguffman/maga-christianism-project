# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 18

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we're continuing with the Gospel of Mark, and I understand that last week through technical difficulties, you were unable to, uh, hear, but a minute of the recorded sermon I did while I was down, uh, south with my daughter at her, uh, the celebration of, of, uh. Yeah, well of uh, what was it, what do they call it?

A baby shower. That's right. Baby shower. And, uh, it was a wonderful time. It's good to be back with you though. Uh, and I promise you today we're not gonna double up in, uh, preach two sermons so you can relax. Those of you who are fearful that that's what was coming, um, we are continuing in the Gospel of Mark, however, and, uh, and, uh, wanna remind those of us, uh, who have, uh, been been following that we are working.

Through the gospel of Mark, uh, doing a close reading of the text, uh, you know, bit by bit going through it, very paying close attention to the artistry of the [00:01:00] author. And, uh, one of the things that I think is really important today is remembering, uh, who Mark's audience was and what was going on in their lives.

I think that's very much germane to our situation today. Um, the, um. The, one of the things that's on my mind is the, the stuff that's going on in Afghanistan now, it's been, you know, filling our news, the despair of the folks, uh, I'm sure the fear of the folks who are seeking to escape what is coming. Uh, with regard to the Taliban regime, as the American forces depart.

Um, and I, and I wanna remind you that that's, uh, not an uncommon experience in human history. And in fact, uh, it's not at all. Um. Well, it's, it's, I should say it's, it's very similar. I would think to some, the despair that would've been felt by Mark's audience, uh, particularly to those in Palestine, but also those in Rome.

If you remember, uh, this was, uh, [00:02:00] mark was writing at a time when, uh, the, the, the Jews had, uh, had provoked Israel by defeating a small contingent of Roman soldiers who had come. Uh, and, uh, and, uh, surprisingly. Uh, the, the Jews stood up and, and, uh, and, and defeated them, which then brought about the inevitable, uh, the inevitable, inevitable crushing of, uh, the, the Jewish regime, uh, the destruction of Jerusalem, et cetera.

Now, that hadn't happened yet. As Mark I. Wrote, we don't think, uh, but it was imminent. And that would've been known to the people, uh, throughout, uh, the Roman Province of Palestine. But it would've been also known to the people who were, uh, Jewish, uh, and Jewish Christians living within the vicinity of Rome.

Uh, and there would've been a spirit we think of, of trepidation. It was like, there is no avoiding this, uh, uh, these things that are ahead of me. There's nothing I can do to get, get, uh, get. It, it free of them. Um, so today I want to [00:03:00] talk to you about that, uh, distraction because I think that's something that's, uh, this, this, this message really can speak to us.

I was thinking the other day about something, I read of a story, you might have seen it in the news of the physician in Alabama, who, who wrote poignantly about the folks that, uh, she was seeing in the ICU, uh, who, uh, were, who had been. Anti-vaxxers and uh, and they were, they were in the ICU being intubated and they were begging her, please, please, uh, you know, vaccinate me now, vaccinate me now.

To which she had to say, it's too late. It's too late. And, and, and the. The pain that she felt, the pain that they felt in recognizing, uh, that, uh, and, and, and as we think about the folks who are going through those types of situations where it feels too late and, and, and, and they're, they're, uh, trapped in despair.

One of the things we've gotta remember is that for many of us, uh, when those types of things happen, uh, that's happening because [00:04:00] we. Refuse the antidote to our despair, or we get confused and, and, and don't, uh, don't take the antidote in a timely manner such that things get in such a situation where it's too late.

Um, very often when we're trapped in despair, we find ourselves in a situation, uh, where we get comfortable with our despair becomes sort of a way of life. In fact, we nurse our woes, we repeat them over and over again, and we relive the. Things that happened to us again and again by sharing the story with everyone about what's happened to us so that we somehow justify our own verdict on ourselves of being worthy of such things.

We justify ourselves, we condemn ourselves, and, and we refuse to be comforted. Uh, famous phrase from the Bible, uh, where biblical characters have been. Critic criticized biblically because of this characteristic of, of being one who refuses to be comforted by grace. [00:05:00] And so there's this sense that I'm trapped and, and, and there's this sense that whether it's in my physical condition, I can't do anything about it.

So I can only live a dismal life or in my work condition. I can't, I, I am simply trapped in this work. I can't, uh, move away from it. I can't get a new boss. I can't move up. I can't move sideways. So I am. And sometimes that happens in our family relations. And we have this sense that, uh, there is no cause for hope, uh, and nothing will ever change, and therefore I am stuck.

And then sometimes we even feel that, well, someone cursed me. Maybe God has turned God's back on me. Uh, or at best, maybe God simply refuses to hear or is incapable of hearing my prayers and I'm, I'm. I'm thinking of that. I've thought about that all week. As I thought about the very last verse in our paree today, the verse 29 in which Jesus says to the disciples, this kind of spirit can [00:06:00] only come out.

Through prayer. I think that's what we ought to be talking about today as we peruse this, this tale that we're gonna be listening, that we listen to today. Now, I know that this story of the Transfiguration is very familiar to Episcopalians. We, after all celebrate the Transfiguration. We remember the Transfiguration stories twice a year, uh, once during the season we call Epiphany, and always once in August.

Uh, liturgically that is, we remember that. And one of the things I'm concerned about is, as we talk about it today, is that we, we've heard so much we stop hearing it. And one of the things that is, uh, I think rather tragic about this story is that in our, the revised common lectionary, we actually cut the story in half so that we, I think, are in danger of missing the whole story.

So today, uh, uh, Dave read to us the entire story, which, which mark put together. 'cause it's, it's all one cohesive story you see. Versus two through 29 and actually the start, the, the story that we talked about last week. So I [00:07:00] wanna remind us and have us listen carefully to that whole story. Uh, and, and what I think, uh, the, the first point, uh, that, that, that we need to remember is that what, what Mark is telling us as we, as we, uh, are, are, are disciples awaiting the.

Inevitable, uh, destruction of Jerusalem, uh, as we await, uh, the pilgrims against us, Jewish Christians in Rome as we, um, await, uh, or, or, or, or give up on, on waiting for God to deliver us. So from, from whatever is causing our personal despair. Is that, is that what has happened here? What, what, what has happened in the, in the, uh, incarnation of Jesus is the dawn of the Messianic age.

And so it's important that we go back and remember what. Uh, you would've heard last week. It's a very familiar story, so I'm only gonna allude to it, uh, briefly, but, uh, but, but the story that we're reading today continues this and it, and it is actually, uh, [00:08:00] fundamental, uh, to it. And so the, what I wanted to, uh, share with you is from last week we heard the gospel text that, uh, where Jesus.

Is explaining for the first time the disciples that he was going to go to Jerusalem and he was gonna be killed. And so in the, in the last verse, in the gospel of Mark, we see that the human one, I mean the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Mark, we, we, we read that the human one must suffer. Jesus says it must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, by the chief priests.

By the legal experts and be killed. And then again, after three days rise from the dead in, in our gospel text today, you, you see it beginning with what's this business about, rising from the dead. You know, they're continuing this conversation. The disciples are with Jesus. But the, but the important point from last week was this part where, where, uh, Jesus says, so here's the deal, folks.

You have to hear this. This is the way, this is the word I've. Been, I've been [00:09:00] brought to share with you. This is the way of living. That, that, that, that, that assures your unity with God. That assures that you are aligned with God and that what you, what you want, and that word is this, that all who want to come after me must say no to themselves.

Take up their cross and follow me. All who want to save their lives will lose them, but all who lose their lives because of me, because of the good news, will save them. This was a, a paradox, obviously, and, and, and, uh, uh, this notion that the, the way of Jesus is to say no to yourself. To offer yourself sacrificially and thereby to follow him.

And that's the means. That's the way, that's the path to the still waters. That is the path to our salvation. That's the word. That's the way of living. That Jesus has come to embody, to teach us to call us too. And, uh, and Jesus [00:10:00] uh, said this, and, and, and the disciples didn't like that word very much. And you, you may remember, this is where.

Peter says, whoa, whoa, whoa. He, and he goes, and he rebukes Jesus. He rebukes Jesus. Uh, twice actually. He says, no, no, no, no, no. That ain't gonna happen. Not on my watch. You know, you, you, you know, you're the Messiah. He, he names him the Messiah for the first time, but he doesn't get what Messiah means. He has this expectation of this triumphant, uh, arrival of, of the Messiah who's gonna come, slay all the dragons.

And instead, Jesus is saying, no, I'm gonna be killed. I'm gonna suffer and be killed. I'm gonna be rejected. And, and Jesus sets up a, a, a, uh. A crucial test for us. He says, whoever's ashamed of me, in my words, will the human one will be ashamed of that person when he comes in the father's glory with the holy angels.

And so we're left with this, um, interesting teaching by Jesus. And the first point is that what appears to be true isn't actually [00:11:00] true. What appears to be Jesus's defeat this promise. In this case, this. This foreshadowing of Jesus's defeat what appears to be Jesus's defeat and what appears to be the triumph of, of not just the Jewish elite, but also the triumph of Rome, of Caesar will actually be Jesus's vindication.

It will be God's judgment on Rome. The Jewish elite. And that was the, the point that I, I believe and shared in, in my sermon last week. Uh uh, and, and, and he, and he then turns to the, to the group and, and, and challenges them saying, you have to choose folks. We must choose which reality we will trust.

Either you stand with Jesus, either you walk Jesus' way, which is this way of denying oneself. It's this way of humble, sacrificial service so that others might flourish. That that is the good news. That actually is the way of performing the good news to [00:12:00] those who are trapped in despair or. We will stand ashamed before him.

Any angels. So that's what, that's the way the story ended last week and it picks up immediately today. And, and, uh, the, the, I wanna break this down into a couple of of groups. The first one being we, we hear in this story that is so familiar to all of us, this story of transfiguration, I'm gonna move through it fairly quickly, is I believe the first thing that, that, you know, Jesus has just said, this is the way.

Now we have this, this, this experience where Mark is saying to the fo is remembering how God said. Listen to him and listen to him about what? Well, and about this word. About what it means to be fully human. The way that we live in, in, sir Now. So one of the things I want to be, I wanna show you here. Um, is, uh, that, that mark in his artistry seems to draw upon some very, very familiar scriptures.

Of course, the scriptures to the folks of Mark's time would've not been [00:13:00] what we know as, uh, the Christian, uh, new Testament, but rather would've been the Hebrew scriptures. And so what we read the very first sentence in, in our reading today, six days later, Jesus took three. And, uh, he brought them to the top of a very high mountain.

I don't wanna have us pass this. So they, what you see is this image of Jesus with this group of three who were having privilege to access. And, uh, and I, I wanna just draw parallels here because it seems that Mark has in mind two different texts that would've been very familiar to his audience. Les familiar with us.

And the first one is the one that, uh, one of the ones that. Uh, Tom and Mitzi read to us today from, from the Book of Exodus in the, in the Prophet Daniel, the first being, the, the, the Book of Exodus, in which we see very similarly the day that Jesus rather, that God called Moses up to Mount Sinai to receive God's word, to receive the word.

That would be the covenant with God, the mosaic law. When that day, that day, God sent. [00:14:00] Another one, not a, not a trusted three, but a trusted assistant. Joshua, the one whose name is, he saves, uh, Joshua. The word Jesus means Joshua as well, right? I mean, I rather the written name. Jesus is Joshua in Hebrew. Um, so, so, so Moses takes Joshua up there with him and they are on once again.

This high mountain and, uh, only only Moses, uh, went near the Lord. The others couldn't come near. And then we, we see, uh, this, this story of the transfix and we see where Jesus, mark says that he was transformed in front of them and his clothes were amazingly bright. Brighter than they had, uh, been, if they had been bleached white.

And, uh, and again, that's very evocative of these Old Testament texts. The one that Mitzi, uh, or rather Tom read us, uh, from the, the prophet Daniel again, continuing from our last, uh, last week's, uh, readings in which, uh, the book of Daniel chapter nine. Was was evoked. And here we see the book of Daniel talking about the human when evoked.

And it describes [00:15:00] this grand vision where you have people standing in fear, just like, uh, the people who Mark was addressing, uh, uh, might have felt fear. Despair. I'm, I'm trapped in my situation. Am I weak? I'm feeling weak. How do I carry on? And we see that vision, uh, that is evoked from the prophet Daniel, where the human one appears, and the Daniel is strengthened by this vision.

And what is that vision? It's of this vision of a man clothed in linen, the, the cloth of martyrs. We, it turns out in the gospel of Mark. But, but just shining with the brilliance, uh, like a, his, you know, his face, like a flash of lightning. And then, and very similarly to that, uh, the, the, the same story about the, the, the giving of the word, the giving of the, of Torah, of God's instruction on Mount Sinai.

We see the people saw it and experienced it, uh, as, as like. Like a blazing fire on top of the mountain. And so Mark seems to be [00:16:00] drawing on these very familiar scriptures to speak of parallels, and it's important. So we see here Moses, we see here from the prophet Daniel, the human one who is the Messiah.

And then we, we also see, uh, Elijah, Elijah presence because Jesus, uh, uh, was, was was there with Elijah and Moses and they were talking to Jesus. So, uh, what are we to make of that? Um, as I've suggested to you, uh, my understanding of this is that, uh, mark is telling us very clearly this time that, uh, that, that we are in now, if you wanna ask, what time is it?

The time is that we are in the Messianic age. We are in the age of the kingdom of God in which it has become real. That's where we are today. So if you're confused about what's happening to you, if you're lost and not unsure of what's going on right now, the answer to the question. God is bringing about, uh, God's justice throughout the world.

And so you should be strong just as [00:17:00] Daniel's, uh, story of, of the Human One's arrival, uh, uh, gave him strength. You too should receive that strength. And so then his disciples, uh, or other Peter, John and James asked. Asked Jesus in that amount of transfiguration, why do the legal experts say, Elijah must come first?

So Jesus makes this very clear what I've just said about the Messianic age, uh, but by, by explaining to them, uh, that, uh, Elijah must come, uh, Peter's get, gets a little confused though. Peter can't, can't quite figure out the relationship between, uh, Jesus. Moses and Elijah, he reacted this way. He said, teacher, it's good that we're here.

So let's make three tabernacles for you, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Uh, and, and, and he's confused. In fact, mark says he was confused. He didn't understand what was happening, but one of the things that's evident is he didn't quite get yet who Jesus was because he puts him on the same rank as Moses, the giver of the law.

On, on is Elijah one of the great prophets, uh, both who, uh, were [00:18:00] on Mount Sinai. Uh, but, but he, but he doesn't quite, uh, understand that he wants to somehow create, uh, something to protect them, to shelter them, and Jesus doesn't wanna be sheltered. Uh, and then we see this wonderful scene that evokes, uh, something that we saw at the beginning of the gospel of Mark in which Jesus was baptized, in this case, of the amount of transfiguration.

Um, uh, we, we hear some words that are very, very similar to what we heard when Jesus was baptized. If you remember when Jesus was baptized in, in verse uh, nine through 11, we saw that, uh, the heavens split, you know, a sign of Theophany and the spirit, like a dove came down upon Jesus and there was a voice, and this voice was a Mark's account.

Just to Jesus only Jesus heard this voice. And the voice was, you, you, Jesus. You are my son whom I dearly love. And you I find happiness. And so, and uh, now, uh, at the, in the middle of March Gospel, we have a very similar, uh, language. This is my son, but now it's addressed to [00:19:00] Peter, James, and John. This is my son whom I dearly love.

Listen to him. Hear his word. What word is the question, right? What am I to hear if I listen to him? And suddenly Moses and Elijah were gone and there was just Jesus, this is my son. So they asked, so they asked him, what, uh, what, what's the deal here? What's the deal with Elijah? Jesus gave him an answer.

Elijah does come first. That's just as we expected. We, Jews expected in all our prophecies. Uh, but Jesus says, uh, why was it written that the human one would, would suffer many things and be rejected? And, and Jesus says, Elijah has come. They did to him what they wanted just as it was written about him.

This is another allusion to and to John the Baptizer. If you recall, throughout the gospel of Mark in our studies, John the Baptizer was seen as, was named by the folks as John the Elijah, as John as, as Elijah is the coming of, [00:20:00] of Elijah. And whenever Elijah came, the Jewish understanding was that meant the Messianic age, uh, had dawned.

And so what are we to make of this story of the, of the, uh. Of the transfiguration, and my suggestion to you is that. Is that we're to understand it as Mark's way, poetically artistically of saying the arrival of Jesus is the dawn of the Messianic age, in which the strong one will come and judge us in our ways.

Judge the world. And bring about God's conquering of evil. That day has started, that day has become, and we see that in Christ Jesus. Um, and it also means another thing. 'cause it's, it's juxtaposed against this story in which Jesus said, the human one will suffer. And Jesus has explained, to save your life, you must lose it.

It it also means that the what the Messiah is teaching us the word, the Messiah has been brought. To teach us is, is, is to express, actually it's God's word from Mount Sinai. You know, [00:21:00] it's God's instruction telling us that the way for us to be fully human, the way for us to be with God, the way for us to be saved.

Is through the cross. And, and, and it doesn't mean just through Jesus going to the cross, certainly, but it means our participation in Jesus is going to the cross, uh, through our imitating him through that, our imitation of him by losing our lives in order to save it. Putting down our lives for our brothers and sisters so that they might as well flourish just as Jesus did for us.

So that's the word, and we hear from this in this, this transfiguration story. Listen to him. So what gets in the way of that? Well, I wanna suggest to you today that what gets in the way of that are our demons. If you recall, demons are those things that get, get us off the path of the way the demons are.

Those things that, uh. That distort the word. So what we hear is not God's very, [00:22:00] very clear word, but a word that causes us to veer away from the still waters that we seek and get into the brambles, uh, that, uh, give us pain and that continue cause us to continue to be trapped and feeling that God is', uh, caring for us.

And so we have this other, this other story, uh, uh, that, that follows immediately upon the these four. Jesus, Peter, John, and James descending the mounts justice. Jesus and Joshua descended the mountain and found, uh, the rest of Israel doing something unexpected. We're gonna get to that in a second. We see that Peter, James, John.

Jesus, uh, returned from the mountain and they exceed a large crowd gathered around the other disciples. And what are they doing? They're arguing with scribes. I. And Jesus asked him, what are you arguing about now? If you've ever come down from a mountaintop experience and [00:23:00] you're still filled with the, uh, the beauty, the joy, the awe of that, uh, you could imagine what it must have been like for these bo to enter, reenter the space of the disciples who were caring about, uh, you know, um, you know, fighting and arguing.

And the answer to the question about what they were arguing about was, well, uh, uh, teacher, uh, I brought my son to you, and, uh. And, and he has a spirit that that makes him mute. He has a spirit that makes him deaf and mute. Whenever it, whenever the spirit overpowers him, it throws him into a fit, like an epileptic fit.

It foams, he foams at the mouth, he grinds his teeth, and, and he stiffens up. So what did I do? I spoke to your disciples. To see if they could throw him out. You know, sort of like you were gone. So I brought it to your assistants who had been about the countryside, uh, doing all sorts of healing. So I brought with the expectation that they would be able to heal him to throw out this spirit, but they couldn't.

And [00:24:00] that sets the stage for, um, uh, Jesus's teaching. Jesus actually gets very frustrated at what he's found. Much like Moses got frustrated with what he found when he came down Mount Sinai. Jesus answered them, you faithless generation. How long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? And then he says, bring him to me.

So. It's interesting here. Mark doesn't tell us we have to, we have to assess who he's upset with. Is he upset with, uh, all of the people before him or just his disciples who had left in charge at the mountainside who he thought he knew, uh, something of, of this word that he had been teaching or not? It's not clear, but we see this disgust that Jesus expresses.

So Jesus says, bring him to me. And the, and he and he, and he inquires about the, the, you know, what the, the condition of the, of the, of the son is to the father says. Yes, son. How long has this been going on? The father says, well, it's been going on ever since he was a child. It's often thrown him into a [00:25:00] fire or into water just trying to kill him.

Now, if you can do anything, help us, show us compassion. And Jesus said to him, if you can do anything, sort of like really after all you've seen, you're saying if I can do anything, all things are possible. For the one who has faith. At that dubois says this, this, uh, wonderful response that, uh, that, that I'm sure, uh, resonates with all of us.

I have faith help. My lack of faith, I. I have belief, help my unbelief. In other words, Jesus, I trust real. Your reality, you, you've said, we have to, we have to trust in your account versus the account of the elders and the chief priests and of Rome, of, of their account, of the way the world is. I trust in your account of that word.

I trust your reality. Help me to choose that reality. You [00:26:00] know, naming how hard it is for us to have our emotions inspire us to take those steps to do that which we know is good for us. You know, sort of like going back to that whole Vaxxer story. Uh, you know, we, we get paralyzed and we're not sure we have these competing accounts and we're not quite sure or not brave enough to choose the one that we actually know is the true one.

The real one. And so we stand paralyzed and we do nothing and we. We get trapped. And so this was the whole, this, this whole boy's life. Uh, he, he had been trapped in his face. And I went, I, I just, I have to show you this, this text, uh, that, that seems so evocative of for me, which is when, when Moses came down from the mountain, you know, he says, hurry up and go down.

Your people. Uh, you just received the law, right? He's got the tablets, you know, hurry up and go down. Your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt are ruining everything. They've already abandoned the path that I commanded. They made a metal bull calf for themselves. They bowed down to it and offered sacrifices to it and declared, [00:27:00] these are your gods Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt?

Do you remember that story? The story of the golden calf that happened right after Jesus had received, I mean, uh, Moses had received God's instruction. And, uh, and Jesus is disgust here to me. And Mark seems to be retelling a, a story that has a very similar plot here. You know, Jesus comes down, there has been this word, listen to him.

And what he sees is his disciples incapable of doing that, which he had equipped them to do. And uh, and he tells us it has to do, uh, with faith. So my suggestion in this second part is that our demons get in the way. They serve the purpose of distracting us, of, of causing us to put our eyes on something that's sort of, you know, I don't know if you've ever been hiking before and you're, you're looking off at something, all of a sudden you veer off.

Of course 'cause you weren't paying attention. Well, that's one of the ways, you know, we can get so focused in life. On other things and other things that might be super [00:28:00] attractive, such that we go off the safe and safe path that leads us to where we were always meant to go. And, um, and then despair can do the same thing.

We can become trapped so that we, so that we, I. Um, we believe that it's simply not safe for us to go, uh, this way that we actually know is the right way to go. Uh, or, you know, because we're afraid that there are giants there that are going to destroy us. You know, we we're, we fear that what might happen, we, we get so trapped in and we forget God's word that says, do not fret.

Over and over again. God's word says, do not. We forget that word. And we, and we don't go. We don't go, go do. We don't follow on the path because we are afraid of, well, what, what if I'm wrong? I have, I have, I have undoubted. I have unbelief. This is the sin called sloth. We, we believe that God is too small to take care of us, so we won't enter the prophet.

Uh, the, the promised land, that's the sin called sloth, or the category of sin called sloth, or, uh, we have the opposite of that. We have the [00:29:00] sin called hubris in which we believe that we are so strong. You know, we don't, we don't need, uh, we don't need God to be with us, to be, uh. Walking with us in this, we got this.

And so that sort of seems to what happened to disciples. They were, they were trying to do this healing, but they weren't doing it. Uh, Jesus is gonna tell us, uh, uh, in the right way. They, they forgot about the essential presence of God. You know, sometimes we think that what causes us to have success or some magical powers that are invested in us, that it's our strength.

And so God is too small, we're too big, and that gets in the way, the sin of hubris. So. Both of these are ways that we practice our unbelief. They're ways that we abandon and avoid the way of Jesus, this way of sacrificial love. And the problem with this is that they make us impotent. They make us docile, they make us passive.

They make us folks who are vulnerable to things just [00:30:00] happening to us instead of being fully human, which is to be acting, always acting, moving towards love when we're fully human. That's what we do when we're off the path, when we're out of faith and we fail to act in in that way. And so Jesus says to them, this kind of spirit, this kind of spirit that is trapping us, trapping you in the stern state of that feels like it's, uh, an inevitable, inevitable destruction can only come out through prayer.

And I think that's the important lesson for us today. So we see this after Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him privately, why? Why couldn't we throw this spirit out? Why? How come you were able to do it and we couldn't do it? And Jesus answers Him. Throwing this kind of spirit out requires prayer.

Think about that, folks. What does that mean? What is prayer? I think that many of us think that prayer, [00:31:00] uh, is something where we recite a bunch of words over and over again every night, the same recitation, the same script that we've been doing for the last, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years. The same formulas.

And we recite it and we give our offer up our petitions. We may throw in some Thanksgivings and, and that's sort of the deal. And if we do that, God's job is to deliver on that. You know? And you know what I wanna remind us of is Jesus ain't Santa Claus. That's, uh, a lot of us have a, an image of God in our heads.

I think where, where, where Jesus is just another name for Santa Claus and prayers about giving Santa Claus our, our list of, of petitions and, and, uh, it's just a recitation of things. And so we, what, you know, we just go right through it. Uh, and it, and it is not. Intimacy with God. It's not the same as what Jesus is talking about here.

And what I wanna suggest you that Mark is telling us is that prayer is a critical reflection. It is a critique. It is [00:32:00] a, it is. It's an invitation to God, to scan our hearts, to look how we are getting in the way of our own salvation, how we are blocking God's spirit, the power of that spirit through. Our own fear through our own habit of nursing our woes, through our own habit of being, being, uh, uh, you know, refusing to be comforted.

You know, you know, rooted in, in either of these two sins I just mentioned. Either hubris, our slaw in which we think either we're too big and don't need God, we don't need God's help. So we just sort of leave God out or. Or God isn't big enough to handle this thing was before me. It is inevitable. I'm just stuck.

Not even God can deliver me or God just chooses not to deliver me. And so prayer is this intense, very personal struggle to resist those particular demons that lead us. That, that, that. Tempt us to get off of the path [00:33:00] and, and to get off of, what I wanna remind us is that cruciform way of Jesus meaning it, the cruciform, the word cruciform means, uh, you know, the, the cross shaped form of, of the way of Jesus.

And that cross shaped form of the way of Jesus is. Offering ourselves in service to others so that they might flourish. And that's how we ourselves participate in Jesus's cross. That's how we become human, which is our goal, right? To be fully human, to be mature humans. And so, so by doing that, when we, when we get on that path and we stay on that path, that begins with the cross and has this expectation of what Jesus has said, this is the Messianic age.

This is the day of the coming of the Lord. This is the, this is the, the age in which God is conquering evil. This is the time when you are being delivered. When we, when we set our, our compass on that course that's going towards that, uh, that, that, that moment that, that. [00:34:00] We're, and we're filled with that expectation of resurrection, of restoration, of liberation, and we, and we plot a course from our cross shaped lives towards that expectation of fulfillment.

Well then we are aligning. Ourselves. With God's work, what God is trying to do, we're aligning ourselves with the grain of the universe. 'cause that's the reality of the world. That's what Jesus has taught us. When we get off of that, then we're out of alignment with the grain of the universe and our efforts are blocked.

And that I think is why the disciples were unable to, um, to do the healing. The exorcism that Jesus had already equipped them to do. And I think the same is true of us. So I think the question for us folks is, are you suffering? And, and if that's true of you, and I would imagine it's true of all of us at times, if you're trapped in despair, if you feel like things are never gonna change, I'm, I'm, I'm simply stuck.

You. If you feel that [00:35:00] God cannot hear those sides of yours that are too deep, uh, well, the problem isn't on God's side. The problem is on your side. Jesus hasn't left you. You've left Jesus. So get back on the trail today. Ask God to reveal how you have allowed despair, how you have led, allowed these demons to cause you to be misaligned with this grain of the universe that always goes through the cross, and always is leading us, always leading us to the resurrection, the restoration that God desires for all of us.

If you do that. Then you will live. You need to lose your life in order to live it. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
