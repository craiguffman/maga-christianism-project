# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 36

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today I wanted to share with you something that happened to me yesterday on my way home. I was flying back from Dallas after having spent some time meeting, uh, for the first time. My grandson, Freddy, who, uh, is, is uh, six months old now. I've not. Ever seen him before, uh, because of the pandemic and in full of joy, I sat down, uh, in, uh, in, in my, my, uh, seat assigned seat 17 f And, uh, shortly thereafter there, there came a woman with child, a young woman about the age of my daughter, Callie.

In fact, she, it turned out she was the same age and, uh, she was, uh, like Callie, uh, very clearly. Um, um. A flush with the joy of, of new maternity, uh, a nursing babe in her arms. And, and, uh, we had a conversation later. Uh, I'd like to share with [00:01:00] you, uh, in some detail, but what I wanted to just. Put in your mind as a backdrop of our conversation about scripture today is a question that, uh, she asked me well into the, the trip.

She reached over and, and, and asked me the following question, why doesn't God hear my prayers anymore? Why won't God guide me anymore? So I, I, I don't know what you would've said to someone in that case. Uh, and, and. I, I'm not sure if I said the right thing, but we had a fabulous conversation. It was a great blessing to me.

And as she went off, I, I prayed for her, uh, and her, and her and her child, and also the current concerns that over the course of our conversation that she had shared with me. So we'll come back to the new mom in, in 17 D but I wanted to ask you to [00:02:00] just sort of keep that question about. God and God's presence to us and our sense of God abandoning us in the back of our minds as we contemplate the word, uh, that we've been given today.

But before we get into that, I wanna ask another question. I'm gonna completely pivot onto you. P pivot on you and, and ask a question, uh, that arises from our biblical texts, uh, these days. Uh, and, and, and, and often as we go through the lectionary, and that question has to do with a problem that we see throughout Paul's letters and, and, uh, and, and also in the, in the texts of the gospel that we've been reading Mark's Gospel as we've been learning to think about that.

Text and, and as a work of art and, and as we've sought together to read it literarily and to understand, uh, what Mark's portrait is telling us about who Jesus is, who Jesus is for us. And the question I wanted to put [00:03:00] before us is why do we see. In scripture, this prohibition against breaking bread with pagans.

As, as you know, this became a big issue during, uh, the time after Jesus, as the church itself struggled with whether to continue to carry on the, the, uh. Culinary laws, uh, those portions of Torah that, uh, that were about, uh, food. Um, but so the question I wanna ask is why do Moses and the prophets repeatedly warn against table fellowship with those who worship Pagan gods?

Now I think the answer, uh, is to be found in Israel's mission. Uh, and, and so this isn't a quiz. I, I wanted to ask you to think about it, but I want to give you what my answer is, and that answer is this, that, that Israel had been given a holy mission, if you recall, going way back to the story, uh, following, no, I mean, God made a promise that he would.

Uh, [00:04:00] build out of the seed of Abraham a people who would be a light to all the nations. And, and Israel was the answer to God's question about how God would, would reconcile all of God's creation, uh, back to God's self. Uh, and, and the, the mission that was given to Israel, as we've spoken about many times, was to make their fellowship with Yahweh visible to.

All the world so that all the world would be drawn into fellowship with God and with all of God's created order to behave. Therefore, as though there is no distinction between that fellowship. The life ruled by the pagan gods was to impede God's purposes. It was to, it was to impede God's purposes of reconciling the world.

So, um, refusing to break bread with pagans was not about bigotry. It was about. Making distinctions that [00:05:00] were important. Certain spaces in our lives are holy and sacred, and certain spaces of our lives are profane. And sometimes it's very important that we keep those differences visible so that we can cause the profane and, and to become more sacred.

And that was where the culinary laws of Torah came, uh, to be. That was their purpose. So what's the problem? With pagan gods. That's another question I would ask you to consider today, because today in our lesson we're dealing with problems with pagan gods. So what's wrong with them? Not just what was wrong with them in ancient times.

What's wrong with what we might call other gods or, or things that act like Gods in our own lives today? Whether they, uh, we conceive of them as religious or not. What's the problem with these things? And I wanna suggest to you that the problem is what St. Augustine, the Bishop Apo said they were long, long ago.

We [00:06:00] clinging to that which is not worthy of our clinging. We elevate as transcendent that which is merely the work of mortals. We're mere the work of our own hands and, and we declare it more than it really is. We invest it with more power. We. Transform it from something that is merely our creation into something that actually has power over us.

Something that allows us to justify evil because this power that we've given these idols command us. Uh, we say we claim again and again throughout our history to do that, which is evil in God's eyes. So, so. In the eyes of, of, of scripture, pagan gods are our inventions. They will wither like the grass. As Isaiah said in our reading today, uh, there are our inventions to which we attach the depth of, of the divine falsely and thereby give them power.[00:07:00] 

So we do evil in the name of our invented gods and we attribute our evil to those Gods insisting that our evil has their divine sanction again and again. We do this sometimes in the names of of Gods that we recognize as other than Yahweh, and for us Christians all too often in the name of Yahweh. The word we give to that when we ourselves do that is blasphemy.

Um, the important point that I want to get across to you is the problem with pagan gods is that our worship of our own inventions dehumanize us. We were created, we assert at the very beginning of our story to be the image of God thee day. And when we worship that which is less than the one true God, uh, well then we.

Call ourselves to be less than we really are. And so we, uh, de human as eyes [00:08:00] ourselves and we act less than human. All of this is a backdrop of something that, uh, was very important in the lives of the Jews in the first century. Uh, want to remind you of the words of the Shema, you know, that end with this, you know, the, the phrase, uh, that you, you're probably familiar with.

Is, um, is is the,

which means hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. This notion that the Lord is one God is very, very important to our story today. The, the, the, the claim of Israel, the claim that Israel was to teach the world that there are not many. God. Uh, there is not your God and there's not, my God, there is not this relativism thing going that we see so much, uh, in our time today.

You know, uh, there's your [00:09:00] truth and my truth. That that is, that is not at all a scriptural view of reality. Uh, there is only one true God. There is in fact, one God that we know as truth, and that one true God governs every space. Presides over all time. The importance of that is that all of these gods that we create ourselves are compartmentalized.

They are the God of the tree over there. They're the God of that space over there. They're the God of this people over here, which allows us to set each of these things in opposition to each other and then. Justify our violence against each other. And over against that, Israel, uh, was, was called to proclaim the reality of the one true God, who is the God of all humankind, of all the created order forever.

You know, from the alpha to the omega, from the beginning to the end of God's time, there's only one true God. There are none of these [00:10:00] compartmentalizations that, that we ourselves invent and that allow us to create gods in our own image. And then the other point of that is that every effort that we make then, uh, to.

To name God as, as, as, as a God who is associated with a particular space in the sense of, of, um, of being the God only of that space. Setting boundaries on God's domain, uh, is a reflection of our own idolatry, and that's the problem with this. Your God, my God thing. It's, it's actually a, even though we may think we're being tolerant in the 21st century, when we speak like that, what we're really doing is using the language of idolatry from the perspective of scripture.

There are not many gods. There's just this one true God that we all know in different ways. So the problem with this. Worship of pagan gods from this perspective of, of scripture, and particularly in the first century, uh, is that the worship [00:11:00] of pagan gods dehumanizes us and it reduces us to less than who God has called us to be.

And it justifies the violence that we do against each other. So this is a little bit of background, uh, to the story that we're going to hear today. Now, I, I. I, uh, I wanna back up a little bit and remind you of what we've been, uh, seeing as we've gone through the gospel of Marx so far, and, and as we've rehearsed the story of Israel together throughout the years.

Uh, in, in a nutshell, if, you know, uh, uh. Israel's story, uh, is, is, uh, is, is a very important story for us to recall. The story of Israel is a story, uh, that begins with God creating all things, being the God of all time. But it quickly, very, very quickly moves to the story of our exiles from. Eden or exile from Paradise Y due to our own rebellion [00:12:00] against the reign of God.

Now, in the backdrop of all this I want to remind you today is what we call we, we, we Christians called the Reign of God. Sunday. It's the end of our church year and one of the things that we are called to proclaim on this Sunday is the of God. And, and so today we remember I invited Saul to remember that we were cast out of Eden 'cause of our re.

Rebellion against that very reign. And then as part of our story, we remember that we also were exiled, uh, to Babylon. Why? Because of our rebellion against the reign of God. This is what a, a young Jew in the first century would've understood as they rehearsed again and again. The stories that were part of their scriptures, the stories of an exile from Eden, stories from an exile to Babylon.

The story of a, of an exile from Babylon that ended in a temple being rebuilt. But yet the sense of a continuing exile, uh, that even though, even though, uh, living in Palestine and Jews that were part of the diaspora, uh, there was [00:13:00] still this sense like the woman, that God had abandoned them, that God was not entering their prayers.

And, um. And, and the, and the, that story was told in the, in the, in the prophets, in, in stories of, of new writings, like the Book of Daniel, in the form of, of, of, of apo, uh, apocalyptic, uh, tales involving beasts. You know, the four beasts that we talk about last week, the, the beasts that are referenced in the, in the, in verse 24 through 27 of our lesson today, uh, which come from the prophet.

Dan, not from the prophet name, but from the book of Daniel, uh, chapter seven. You know, those four beasts of Assyria, Babylon, Greece and Rome, all nations institutions who were oppressors, they were, they were nations who worshiped. Pagan gods who justified their oppression of Israel on the basis of their gods, who were less than the one true creator, God.

Uh, and, [00:14:00] and our part of our story is, uh, that that happened not be, not merely because those nations were engaged in their own idolatry, but that God let that happen to us. Let that oppression happen, uh, due to our own rebellion. Against God's reign in our heart and in our lives. And so this is the story of Israel that would've been understood in the first century, but also along with that story was a promise, the divine promise, the promise that the prophets, uh, such as we heard in this, in this story.

Uh, the, the, the, the oracle from Isaiah, the Gospel of Isaiah chapter 40, where we get the word gospel, literally the very, the first time in scripture, Evangelian gospel. The good news we hear, the good news that Yahweh has promised, in spite of our unacceptability, in spite of our rebellion against God's reign.

Yahweh would, you know, would never abandon us, would in fact deliver us from our [00:15:00] oppressors so that we might live in the fullness of the fellowship with Yahweh that Yahweh, uh, had created us for, and was. And that was the very means by which Yahweh was reconciling all of the world. Um, and so there was this promise, and so this was Israel's story.

Um, and, uh. That leads us to where we are in our, our gospel lesson today where, where there is this promise, but there's this sense of ongoing exile. And then we see, uh, Jesus arriving on the scene. Uh, and Jesus, as you have seen, has been going around, uh, proclaiming, uh, the, the, the, the rising, uh, the, the, the, the creation of God's new kingdom, the dawn of God's new kingdom.

And, uh, and he's been spending a lot more time pointing, not at the oppressors as [00:16:00] responsible for our sense of exile, but at ourselves in the, in the gospel of Mark, there's a certain sense that Jesus is saying, we have met the enemy and he is us. In other words, what we've seen throughout this last 13 chapters is that the, the problem of Israel.

Was not the Roman legions so much. They were part of the problem. And, and the pagans themselves that had always, uh, been, uh, oppressing, uh, Israel throughout the last 800 years, where certainly part of the problem, but the real problem is Jesus has shown is, is us. It's in particular our shepherds, the ones that God had entrusted, uh, leadership.

Of, of the temple too. Uh, so, so Mark shows that Jesus came and taught something extraordinary. Uh, the Pagans were not the problem. Those oppressing the Jews, those sustaining our experience of exile. The, the experience for, of exile, particularly for the [00:17:00] people of the land, that 90% of the people who were the peasants, uh, uh, within Israel, uh, uh, you know.

As they lived in the promised Land, as they lived in the land of milk and honey, where each of them had a rightful share, uh, you know, so many of them had not tasted of its fruit. And the responsibility of that was not the legions of Rome, but the very ones entrusted to preside over Yahweh's Temple, the place where the tabernacle had been placed.

You know, remember the tabernacle, the tabernacle. Was, uh, where God dwelled, uh, with the people as they were shaped into God's people as they wandered throughout the wilderness. It wasn't where God lived, but it was where God would come to meet with God's people in a metaphorical sense, in the. Temple was what David had made the location.

And so the temple itself had become, you know, the house, the house of the Lord, and it was a house that was supposed to be a house of prayer for all the [00:18:00] nations. And there was a certain group of people who had, uh, been appointed by God to preside. Over that temple to administer it. This place where Yahweh would dwell, uh, amongst God's people.

And it was the Temple State leadership that we see Jesus attacking each of these last 13 chapters again and again. Uh, and, and, and he told in a metaphor, uh, his view that the temple leadership had squatted on God's vineyard as though they owned it. That they owned it and not Yahweh as though the vineyard was theirs and the fruits that were, uh, from the vineyard were rightfully theirs and not Yahweh's, and they had turned, Jesus said the holy place into an instrument of oppression not serving God's people.

Instead oppressing God's people. They had transformed that simple tabernacle where Yahweh dwelled in the midst of the people into a massive golden calf. They had invented an [00:19:00] ideology, which we saw, uh, exploited the poor, exploited the young widow, or rather the, the older widow. Uh, uh, they'd created a cultic apparatus, uh, which was all dressed in gold that produced the very same wild.

Fruit of those who worshiped pagan gods to the extent that there was very little difference. You know, no very little distinction between the temple and the way it was practically, uh, experienced. And any of the ancient temples we, we might see. Otherwise, in the sense of it had become a locus of exploitation, and that is all the backdrop.

That's what we've been seeing. That's what led us to our, our gospel text today. Last week we talked about how Jesus condemned the temple, pronounced God's judgment on the temple, and said that it would be destroyed. And that brings us to where we are today. And I want you to think of this as, as, uh, Jesus' last [00:20:00] conversation.

You know, mark doesn't record a Last Supper, but this is, I imagine it is Holy Wednesday. And, uh, Jesus is, uh, I. Is sitting there overlooking on the Mount of Olives, uh, from the Mount of Olives overlooking the temple. And he is just pro. He's, we're, we're, we're continuing to hear this conversation with his disciples, uh, about why he, he has, uh, predicted and, and named, uh, uh, you know, cursed, if you will, the temple and said that God would, would, uh, allow it to be destroyed.

That's the conversation that he's having, that we're continuing to hear today. And I wanna remind you. Of one of the things that, that, that I think is a, an important backdrop to this conversation. Evidently, Jesus would repeatedly tell this story, this parable of the vineyard in which the Lord of the House sent his servants to the vineyard and, uh, those who were squatting on the vineyard.

Killed each one of those servants. Then the Lord of the House [00:21:00] sent his son to call them back to covenant faithfulness and they killed them. Jesus has been teaching the disciples, uh, of, of his expectation that, uh, he would be killed. He. He has willingly marched, uh, at a, at a, at a brisk pace to Jerusalem expecting to fulfill this vocation with this parable.

Uh, you know, part of that explanation. So now Jesus sat overlooking the temple and he declared that it would be destroyed. He said that Yahweh was departing the temple because, uh, it had been become defiled by those who were entrusted to keep it sacred, just as God allows us to die, if you recall, because our sin does not belong in our eternal fellowship with God.

It's unworthy of life with God, so to God would allow the [00:22:00] unthinkable to happen. The temple in all its pagan like ideology, uh, that enriched the elite at the expense of the people of the land. Would be destroyed. God would depart the temple and allow the pagans to destroy it because it had no place in the ongoing life of Israel anymore.

Uh, this was the conversation that, that, uh, Jesus had, um, with, with his disciples. And he said that, but when you see this, things are not going to be what they seem. God is in fact. Not destroying the world as uh, a, you know, so that you can occupy it and flourish in it, but rather God is creating all things.

New God's kingdom is daunting. Things won't be what they seem. Um, uh, the temple will be destroyed with all that's pa ideology. But what the way to understand this is not that God is. Departing Israel and abandoning Israel. The way to [00:23:00] understanding it is that God is creating all things new, and the Lord of the House is now returning to dwell among us.

In other words, it's not that your exile is now beginning. It's that your exile is now ending. The new beginning, God is returning to us. This, this experience for which you have yearned of God being present to all the people, which has been blocked by the covenant unfaithfulness of, of, of the shepherds. Uh, well, that time is over.

The Lord of the house will return to dwell among us, and so they, they ask rightfully. Well, when would these things happen? When would these things happen? And so Jesus has said, told them, uh, several things here. First, he said that the, the sun, uh, certain things had to happen. One of them is that the sun had to die.

The, the sun would take on the powers, those powers created by humans, the. Powers [00:24:00] given to these PA and gods, uh, by, by, uh, assigning to them divinity that was false. Uh, those powers, you know, the son would take on and would reveal to the world their impotence he would take upon himself. Uh, all the evil we do in our worship of the idols that we create, he would suffer the ultimate forsakenness that we humans inflict upon each other.

Cross and he would emerge victorious. This is all background. They would, they were about to see this happen in, over the course of the next three days. But the important point, the things that, uh, that, that they would not see, that they would have to have, uh, faith in. Was, it was this promise that we're speaking of today, that he would be vindicated, that his, his life would be validated by Yahweh, that he would in fact be enthroned.

That's what the language quoted from, uh, Daniel [00:25:00] seven. Uh, about the, about the descending on the clouds. To the heavens, ascending on the clouds, to the heavens to be en prone. Where, where he would sit, where the Messiah would sit at the right hand of God, the father, uh, sit at the right hand of Yahweh. Uh, that that's what's act actually happening here.

He was saying to them, I will ascend and, and I will be enthroned as the Messiah. So Yahweh would depart the temple. It was the next thing that had to happen, and Yahweh would allow the pagans to destroy it, but that would not be a. Side of Yahweh's, departure from his people, but of his judgment, a sign of his judgment on the Pagan ways of Israel.

And it would be a sign of his creation of a new way, a new way of dwelling with us, a new way of God with us, and the name we give to that. As you know the name, we are called to celebrate as you know, a. Is [00:26:00] Emmanuel, Emmanuel, God with us. This is the new temple. And so this is all the backdrop of this conversation where Jesus tells them, stay alert, stay alert.

And, and I don't want you to miss, he's still echoing the prophets as he, as he went in, in, in his first words. Uh, about, about, uh, ascending on, on the, on the clouds and, and being enthroned, uh, by the ancient one, uh, quoted. Uh. You know, the sacred scriptures. So too, when he says to stay alert, is he quoting the sta the sacred scriptures?

He's, in fact, I think you, you hear very clearly, uh, uh, Isaiah, where Isaiah continues after announcing the good news, uh, to speak and, and to call the people to a holy wokeness, uh, call them to being alert. Uh, he says. The prophet says, how beautiful upon the mountains of the feet of a messenger, who proclaims peace, who brings good news, that evangelism, who claim, who proclaims salvation, who says [00:27:00] to Zion your God rules?

In other words, Jesus is saying the destruction of the temple correctly understood is the advent of the reign of God. Not the absence of the reign of God. That's the way to understand what you will see. And then the prophet Isaiah, uh, uh, continues. Uh. To say that the words like Jesus says, he says, listen, your lookouts lift their voice.

They sing out together right before they, uh, their eyes. They see the Lord returning to Zion. What a paradox The temple destroyed means. That the Messiah is vindicated and that the Lord, the house has returned to be present to his people at last. I think that's what we're to hear in these words from Jesus, where he says, watch out, stay alert.

You [00:28:00] don't know when that time is coming. It's as if someone took a trip, left the household behind and put the servants in charge, giving each one a job to do and told the, the porter the doorkeeper to stay alert. Therefore, stay alert. You don't know when the head of the household will come. And then he, he names Jesus names.

Interestingly enough, the times that we are about to see. The, the passion narrative ahead, the he names the times of, of, uh, of the ritualistic Israeli prayer. The, the times of prayer still practice throughout the world. Every, uh, four hours or so. You know, the time of evening, the prayers at midnight, the prayer is at the, at the time the roosters crow, the prayers, uh, in the early morning at Daybreak.

Uh. In the passion story we're gonna say, these are gonna be times where the people are called to be alert. But instead what will happen is the disciples will deny Jesus's reality at each one of those moments. [00:29:00] Interestingly enough, mark, uh, you know, brings that together as he recalls Jesus's words. But then again, he continues.

Don't let him show up when you weren't expecting and find you sleeping. What I say to you, meaning what he says to disciples, he says To all meaning us. Stay alert. Stay alert folks. We are called to a holy wokeness. I know that's a, a phrase that, uh, has, has, uh, meaning that is, is hard for us to grasp in our particular time where it's become, uh, you know, words for, you know, for us to fight over.

But it's clearly very clearly scriptural, which brings me back. To this woman that I met, uh, in 17 d as I sat on the plane yesterday, she, she, uh, she and I had a conversation as she first sit down and I shared with her the [00:30:00] fact that, uh, I saw her baby. The baby looked about the same age as, as my Freddy, my grand, my new grandson, and we didn't have much conversation until about an hour later she saw that I was reading on my iPad as I am.

Prone to do some, some, uh, a text that, uh, uh, was, was that, that by which she could identify me as a Christian. So she, she interrupted me and she said, are you and your wife Christian? And I said, yeah, yeah, of course. And then she says, would you mind if I ask a question? I said, no. Uh, and, and then, and before that I, I, I had let her know, yeah, I'm actually a pastor.

And she said, would you mind if I ask you a question? I said, sure. And she said This, God seems to have abandoned me. He used to hear my prayers. He used to answer them, but now he seems not to hear them anymore. He seems to have abandoned me. What did I do wrong? That was the, those are questions asked over several minutes.

Uh, I've summarized here, but I wanted to share with you. I didn't of course go through all the stuff I've just went [00:31:00] with you, but it certainly reminded me, her questions reminded me of this text before us, uh, this week. So I wanted to share with you just a little bit of, of some of the things that I think are the good news for that woman in 17 D that I shared with her that are, are good news that arise from our story today as well, uh, that I hope are good.

The good news that you hear, uh, today, uh, in the word resonating in our worship. And the first of thing I shared with her. Is that it's absolutely normal for us, uh, to feel as we are on our walk, uh, times of spiritual deserts. Those are a common part of, of, of life along the way of love. Uh, but, but the, the, the important point, uh, is that, that, uh, this experience isn't real.

It's not ever that God is abandoning us. Uh, in fact, as Christians, we proclaim what, uh, Jesus would promise on Monday, Thursday that one would come alongside us and in our language today, we would say [00:32:00] that the Messiah's spirit, the Christ's spirit dwells within us is, is part of us guiding us along. So we recognize the truth connecting us always so that.

God reigns within us. God reigns, uh, God's word reigns within us that we're able to recognize, uh, you know, the authentic word of God into and to have our lives be ruled by that. And so God never abandoned us. God is actually within us. Uh, that's a fundamental Christian claim. So the problem is never that.

Uh, the Messiah has abandoned us. Uh, that's, that's never the reality, even though that's what we experience. And I, and I, I, I gave her an analogy. You know, you have this baby that I see at your, uh, your, your breast. Uh, could you imagine when the baby cries, does the baby think, uh, my mommy has abandoned me?

And if he does think that in the, in the agony of those cries, is it actually true? Or is it [00:33:00] just that the baby is unaware that mom has actually drawn near and is readying, uh, her breaths to provide that which provides the sustenance that is needed, which is the reality. And of course, she knew. The truth of her faithful maternity, her faithful love of that babe.

Um, so, so the problem I said is always, always that not that God has abandoned us, but that we ourselves wander off the way of love. And, and I invited her and I invite you to remember that we are finite. And free. We are free. And so we can, you know, volitionally walk off the way of love, but we can also simply get lost and lose our way and wander off because of our senses being blocked.

You know, it's. We, we perceive, we learn to know all things through our senses and, [00:34:00] and, and, and sometimes we simply are blind, uh, to God's presence. Sometimes we simply can't hear it, can't feel it, can't touch it, and we get confused like that in infant and believe that the absence of those sensations or our inability to notice those sensations actually means that God is not with us, that God is not present to us.

And, uh, and so. I invited her to, to think about this and to recognize that the truth is in fact that God is present. And so the problem is not that God has abandoned us, but that we need to get better at noticing God that we are called, in fact, to a spiritual wokeness. Um, spiritual growth is about, in fact.

Holy wokeness. It's a, it's a, it's an awakeness to the Messiah. Breaking into our lives, breaking into our profane lives, you know, our, our lives that are less than holy. Our, our [00:35:00] lives that we live, when we wander off the way, summoning us back to the path, calling us back to the way of love guiding us, giving us course directions to get back on that way so that we might be transformed.

Into the fullness of humanity that God desires for us, so that we might, in fact inhabit God's dream of, of, of living as one who is the image of God. Uh, and, and thereby so that we do our part in making the world more sacred. Why has God abandoned me? I hope to this day, if you feel. Such a thing. If you have been feeling that God is not hearing your prayers, if, if you have been feeling that somehow you have wandered off the path and can't get back on it, that you will pause on this Sunday [00:36:00] and commit yourself to a holy wokeness.

Commit yourself to, to listening closely more closely, being more alert to the reality of God. In every fiber of our created order, uh, calling you to, to a life filled with God's goodness, calling you to live fully. And, uh, and, and if you are unable to hear those things, to see those things, to experience those things, to surround yourself with others who can name that reality for you.

And so to help you back on that path, to be the living hands of Christ. For you, guiding you back to hearing the word of God saying to you, you are indeed my beloved. For that is the truth that Jesus went to the cross to proclaim. That's the truth that God has already said about you. Like the baby at that woman's breast, that woman in [00:37:00] 17 D uh, you are God's beloved.

May you hear that word today? Remember it, and be and let it transform your reality this day. In the name of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen.
