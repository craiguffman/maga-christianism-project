# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 13

[00:00:00] Well, folks, uh, I just want to say a few brief words I wanna share with you. We've been walking through the gospel of, of Mark. Uh, I, there's not much for, for me to, to say today about our gospel lesson that, that I want to say. Other than that, uh, I always chuckle about this story, which is it, which is, uh, is, is humorous.

Uh, I'm not sure if it's apocryphal or true. In terms of historically, uh, having happened, but, uh, it's certainly a story that, uh, that Mark uses to make a point and, uh, uh, I'm, I'm not going to belabor it too much, other than it's, you always wonder where we get this phrase, I want his head on a platter and we, it comes from folks who are familiar with this story.

No doubt. Instead, I wanted to just share with you, uh, something of from the, about the lesson that we let read last week, uh, in which we, we told, we, we talked about Jesus, uh, going home to his home region, and, uh, and we, we, we saw that his neighbors were sus suspicious at his reno. [00:01:00] Uh, they questioned his wisdom.

They questioned all the mighty works that had been wrought by his hands that, uh, had become famous throughout the area. And they were suspicious because they knew this guy. They knew he was like them had, and had, had, had the same education, the same type of training. And so, you know, they were, they were skeptical because where did all this.

Come from, it didn't seem natural and, and, and, uh, they did not have faith in what they were seeing. And, and the, and the story tells us that, uh, uh, Jesus in this case was, uh, unable to, uh, you know, being scandalized. He was unable to, uh, do those mighty works among them, or he accomplished another money works that.

That, uh, had aroused his hometown's crowd, uh, hometown crowd's, suspicion, and the, and the, and the story goes, it was because of their lack of cooperative faith, their lack of cooperative faith. I've been thinking about this story. So Jean and I have been, um, mulling [00:02:00] over, um, lots of things with that are going on with her work and, uh, and that's caused us to do a lot of running.

That's one of the things we do, uh, when we are. Um, trying to just be together, you know, just enjoy each other's company, but also to sort of sort through things in a, in a private way. We, we run down, uh, a trail. You, you're probably familiar with those of you here, the Lehigh Valley Trail, which was an old railroad spur that's been converted into a beautiful, uh, trail.

And there's a portion of it that, uh, is a segment that is, is usually unpopulated. You're not like, it's so remote that, that most people don't make the effort to drive to, to, to park there and then ride their bikes or run. Uh, and so it's unlikely that we will actually encounter anybody there other than, um.

The folks who were riding, you know, bicycles and it's very rare. So we'll take Sadie and we'll just, uh, run and we'll talk. And in fact, this morning we got up this morning and, and, and we just, uh, prayed together as [00:03:00] we ran. Uh, but yesterday we ran as well. And, uh, I had this moment, uh, when I was, was running, and which I was just stunned by the beauty of it all.

I, I looked out, uh, as we ran along this segment that is, uh, still so, so, you know, natural and, and overgrown. Uh, with, with forests and, and wetlands and things, and I was just. Overwhelmed in a, in a beautiful way by the grandeur of nature, overwhelmed by looking at, you know, just, just the extraordinary diversity of life and how you saw trees falling, and then the trees falling and leaning were creating habitats for other things that would spring up.

And, and so what in, in the context of our thinking that, you know what we. We saw was this, this message of, of this super abundant life that God creates and recreates and, and the, and the, and the, the providence, [00:04:00] uh, that it, that one sees just in a little segment of, of the created order. And uh, and, and we were reminded together of, of the truth that is proclaimed throughout scripture that this is the reality of our God, that, that ours is a God.

Who is constantly creating, constantly giving life, constantly making things new, constantly creating things out of nothing. And, and that, and, and we were reminded of this because it's such an important thing to remember, it's one of those things that we can so easily forget. When we are feeling, uh, beset by storms, when we, when it feels, uh, that things at home or work or uh, in our extended families, uh, uh, just gets so filled with stress that we become anxious.

It's easy at such times, isn't it? To think that, you know, all of our life consists of those stressful, um, you know, clips of our life. And so when we go out and we take walks [00:05:00] like this for, for Sina and me at least, uh, it, it is the reminder that no, those things, those moments of stress, those moments of conflict are not the complete truth about the world.

Uh, the truth about the world is whatever it is we're experiencing, it happens within the context of this created order in which God is constantly drawing us to the good that God desires for us. And when and whenever we remember that I. Um, we are reconstituted, we are reenergized, we're renourished, uh, much like when we come to the table.

So I wanted to leave that thought, uh, with you as a, as a way of really framing our conversation about the scripture lesson, um, that, uh, that followed, uh, the story of Jesus being a prophet. Uh. Who's, who's not a prophet in his own home. And that's the story of his sending out, uh, the disciples. Um, but before I get into that, I, I, I wanted to stick with my story about [00:06:00] running because there was another thing that occurred to me as, as, as we were running, I.

And that is, you know, uh, we're, we are called to run the good race. We're called to persevere. Philippians is, uh, chapter three and four all about, uh, uh, Paul telling the story of his conversion. He had all these, these, uh, all the symbols of life, all the things that, uh, testified to his success in having arrived.

He was among the elite. His, his future was assured. And then of course, uh, Jesus of Nazareth happened to him and his life was turned upside down. And he said all those other things aside as, as having, uh, as having, you know, no, no longer any value, uh, in the life that he was to live ahead. And he, and he and then talked to us about, no, uh, if, if you are following this way of love.

You need to set all those other things aside as they've been relativized. [00:07:00] Because what matters is your pursuit of, of this way that Jesus is teaching, following him, sharing in his burdens, sharing in his way together. And it's is a very, very tough thing to do. And so we're called to run this good race.

It's an endurance race, is the metaphor he uses. They actually, in a couple of places, makes allusions to, uh, some. Precursors of what we call the Olympics. Um, and, and just saying, you know, Christian life is, is an endurance sport. And I, and I was thinking about that because, uh, running is my favorite endurance sport.

I've done triathlons and, uh, the, and you know, I like to swim. I like to ride, but I'm really love to run. And one of the things I've learned about running. Is, um, sometimes you, you gotta be careful not to run too fast. Uh, this is probably the most important wisdom that someone who's trying to be an endurance runner, uh, can be.

Uh, you know, we learned that as kids in the story about the tortoise and the hare. Uh, but from a science perspective, what we understand [00:08:00] is, you know, you can't run a marathon. At sprint speed. In fact, uh, it's very important, uh, that you run actually more slowly than you're capable, uh, at times. Uh, for a very important reason.

If you're going to in, if you're gonna run at sprint speed very quickly, you're gonna, you're going to, um, exhaust the energy sources that fuel your running. Uh, and, and what we've learned about that in science is. Uh, the, our bodies have been made so that we can, um, uh, draw energy from basically 2, 2, 2.

There're more than this, but, but two primary forms of energy that our bodies stored. Now you guys know this. I just wanna name this. Uh, and the primary one that we're used to, uh, when we fill up at the gas station of life, you know, is carbs, right? We go, we go eat a banana, we go eat an apple, we eat some, uh, something less healthy forms of car, carbohydrates and that, and that, that fuels us.

Um, the problem with that is that the carb, the carbohydrates that we eat, burn [00:09:00] very fast. That was the problem with the hair, right? Uh, you, you, they give us very quick source of fuel, but our body can't store. Our body doesn't store large reservoirs of carbohydrates. Uh, the, the, the, or the, the, um, sugars that get converted from the carbohydrates.

It gives a pretty small tank for that. Uh, the good news about carbohydrates is that when we want to sprint like the hair. Our bodies can combust that fuel very, very, very fast. Uh, and so we only need it for short durations. And if evolutionary psychologists, uh, and scientists, uh, think that, uh, this, you know, we've been designed that way so that at times we need to, you know, get away from a bear, right?

We need to get away from that threat. And so we have to have a way to have a fuel. That'll allow us to just drive into safety, you know, in short spurts, right? And so our carbohydrate gas engine, you know, is designed to do that. But, but, but that's not designed for the marathon? No. We have a [00:10:00] different, uh, source of energy that our body stores in great abundance for some of us super abundance, unfortunately.

Uh, and that is fats. Body fats and uh, and our body can store those all over the place, as we all know. Uh, but that's for a reason. That's so that we can run the marathon. So if you're gonna be a marathoner, the skill that you have to learn is to, uh, to train your brain to primarily rely on burning, not the carbohydrates.

'cause you're gonna need those. But the fats, and that requires running more slowly. It means, you know, running in a way that, uh, is very deliberate so that your brain knows, uh, he or she is going at such a pace that I don't need to tap upon these, this carbohydrate store, which is pre small and precious. I can just rely on this almost infinite store of energy.

Is the fact that they have. And so it's about learning to, endurance training is about learning to [00:11:00] rely on not the thing that is ready and easy and instinctive to us, but the thing that is present and capable of nourishing us throughout the whole race. Uh, and as I was thinking about that, I thought that's a.

For me at least, a great, uh, metaphor for what, uh, our gospel lesson is teaching us today. Um, one of the things I know about myself and I would imagine might be true of many of you is I have a tendency to rely on something that is ready and easy for me. It's always present, and that's my reason. I will, I will experience some sort of stimuli in life, whether it's, you know, uh, the, the wasps that were threatening the kids outside the other day or something at Sag Gina's work or something in a family situation or some sort of, you know, mental challenge.

Uh, my instinctive reaction always is the easy one is just sort of take the, take the data. I've been trained to do this. Take the data that's incoming, you [00:12:00] know, give consideration to it, and, uh, figure out what needs to be done. That, that's a very, you know, very logical, methodical approach. Um, but sometimes I can.

Rely on my reason too much. Uh, in, in, in, in certain situations, in, in, in, in ways where I'm not really capable of, of, uh, having a command of, of the situation. 'cause I don't actually have, and I can't comprehend all that is going on. I can't see anything but my portion of the story. Now we have metaphors that talk about this.

You guys are familiar with the story of the elephant, you know, where we're all. Trying to see the elephant. The elephant is so big, we only see our portion of it, you know? Uh, and, and, uh, if we're on the other side of the elephant, you know, uh, you know, the persons that are on the other side see a completely different thing.

You might use the musical score. I've used that metaphor before where if we're in the clarinet section, we. We hear the melody we're playing. We don't necessarily hear what the trombones are doing. We certainly can't play their part. We can't comprehend what they're doing often. So there's a lot of [00:13:00] ways of describing this reality that when we live life, we can't comprehend the whole.

And the fallacy in this long race of life that we tend to fall into is this notion that we can very quickly make sense of it all with our reason. And then make good decisions that are going to sustain us. Uh, and that that's the only way that we are called to navigate life. And it certainly is true that we need that way of thinking in, uh, in, in, in much of what we do.

And it's always a, something that is, is at play. But there is another source of reasoning. Uh, that, uh, that God has given us Christians, and not just us Christians, but all, all humanity actually. And that is what we'd call, uh, the Spirit. Uh, we Christians call the Spirit, uh, and it, it has to do with this capacity to be connected to this super abundant source, uh, that the, that the, that the world is called [00:14:00] the logos.

Wisdom and to tap into that and to be moved by that, through this connection to, uh, the world that is beyond ourselves, beyond our own human reason. It's, it's a way of tapping into, uh, and, and, uh, and, and understanding. That, uh, the world, uh, is, is, uh, greater than ourselves and greater than we can possibly manage by ourselves.

But, uh, but yet the truth about the world is that God is in charge. And so we hear that the psalmists say, be still and know I'm I am God. And, and for me, that is a reminder that I am to. Breathe I am to see what I saw on that segment of the Lehigh Valley trail. See and pause and see that God is, is, is constantly, you know there.

There were so many I. Bushes in bloom, so many flowers in bloom, so many berries, different kinds of [00:15:00] berries that were, that were, that were uh, uh, being encountered by Sami yesterday. And, and, and just to see all that God is doing and what a small piece of it that we are is so reassuring and so that this other engine, this other, uh, means of, of, of.

Living is learning to rely, not so much on our own reason, but by learning to rely on faith. Learning to trust that wherever we go, no matter what circumstances seem to be presenting, God is actually present. Be still know that I am God. Know that God's nature is to be present with you, constantly recreating your circumstance 'cause God loves you and is leading you to the good.

And so be still, don't be anxious, do not fret. As we hear at the Psalms, say repeatedly in Psalm 37, do not fret because the reality about the world is not what your reason tells you [00:16:00] it is in these short moments, the reality of the world is grace. And God's resurrecting nature. So I, I wanted to just share that with you because Jesus does a crazy thing, uh, after he goes home.

You know, in chapter three, we saw a similar situation. Jesus was rejected by, as you guys recall, in chapter three of God, the gospel mark. He was, he was, uh, uh, rejected by the Pharisees and the uh. The religious leaders and the political leaders of his time and his, his, his, his reaction to that was to call the disciples.

This time, having done his ministry among the Jews and done his ministry among the Gentiles, he takes, he, he returns across the lake and goes back home. And now he has all this renowned, he is rejected there. And his, his reaction there is, is now to do something very similar. He now. He takes these disciples that he has [00:17:00] gathered and he says, I can't do this alone.

I have been training you, you've been seeing this, that I've been teaching you about God's nature now in twos. I want you to go out and spread the world and proclaim and do the things I've taught you. And so Jesus does that. Um, and I I just wanted to point out what he says to them. I think it's very important.

He says that you're not to travel with anything. But your staff and your sandals. So in terms of what is to sustain, you don't do the thing that you would think would be normal. What would you do if you were going on a trip? You know, once Jean and I went down on our vacation, you know, we packed all sorts of clothes, we packed all sorts of things, you know, to help us in our play.

We packed a, a little refrigerator that I plug into the cigarette lighter in my, in our van, uh, that kept all sorts of healthy food in the back to feed the kids and ourselves as we drove, you know, 12 hours. You know, we, we brought what we needed for sustenance, you know, you know, we brought [00:18:00] money where the capacity to use money.

You know, Jesus says, just bring your staff and your sandals. Nothing more than that. In other words, the disciples were to be like Jesus, who had just been renounced in his own home. They were to take on the status of a soner in the land. Um, and they were to remain there and, uh, and and, and be subject to the social and political perceptions of the.

Of the local populations, those local towns, you know, uh, and, uh, and they were to make no effort to be covert. They were, uh, they were, when they were offered accommodation, they were to stay and they were to establish fellowship with the people who would welcome them. And, and, uh, and yet those who would not welcome them, they were just say, okay, that's fine.

And they just shake, you know, shake the feet off their. Their feet and then, and to move on to the next place, trusting that God will do [00:19:00] something with the seeds that they had planted. The, the important point about this that, that I wanna suggest to you is that the, it is something I'm trying to teach, uh, uh, our, our youngest sons there, um, who, who's very young and, and that is, I've been trying to tell him, no, no, no.

To be a man means to be strong. To be, to be strong means, to be a person of service, uh, is just to not to be the one who is first, but to be the one who is first to serve. Who's to, who's to? Help your sister. You know, it's, it is to offer your place to her. It's to defer. That's how you're strong. Not by beating her in line, but by being the one who offers a hand, offers a share of love.

That's what a real man does. You serve others. That's what I've been trying to teach him, and I think that I'm trying to do that because I've learned this wisdom from Jesus, and I know you guys know this, and Jesus was utterly vulnerable. He came. Descended onto Earth, and, and, and he gave up all honor, [00:20:00] all power and made himself utterly vulnerable to us and depended upon the, the hospitality of, of us.

Uh, in terms of how he received him. He, he did God, you know, Jesus did not force himself and does not force himself on us. Uh, and so when we follow him, he tells us that we follow him by entering into the places to which we are assigned with that vulnerability that recognizes that we don't get to write the rules.

We don't get to have the comfort of being able to construct the story of the people to whom we are sent. We can't do that. They already have their part of the story. We go, in other words, so that our faith in God's providence must be. Exactly that faith. Trust. In other words, we were to model and draw others into this life of trusting God by actually trusting God ourselves.

So take only your sandals, take only [00:21:00] your staff and trust that God will provide everything that is necessary to get through you through the situations of life. And when we do that. What we learned is our lives are transformed because our minds are renewed and we learned that God actually does provide, and therefore then we have the peace that surpasses all understanding.

So I don't know what your situation is. I don't know, uh, you know, where you, what you're feeling right now. Perhaps you've been rejected in your own home, your own true home, somehow and throughout somewhere, perhaps in your family maybe. I'm not sure where you have been sent. Have you been sent to a, uh, to a family whose members you didn't choose, or whose members don't accept you in the way you desire to be accepted?

Perhaps you have been sent to a, to work in a, in a, in a place of employment, uh, uh, or a leadership role in some institution that was created to be a blessing to the community that is struggling to be that now. [00:22:00] Um, uh, but I guess the point is it's not about us. It's about the mission for which we are sent, and when we simply strive to be faithful and trust that God has given us a staff and given us some shoes to walk in, uh, and that God will provide the, the, the rest.

Then we ourselves, uh, are blessed by a strength that allows us be to be the servant leaders that God has called us to be. Uh, so that, uh, God's word does not return empty for, for any of those, uh, who are still struggling to hear the word of grace. And so you're called into that. I'm called into that. Uh, may we all strengthen each other with these reminders, uh, that God truly does deliver when we trust, uh, and, and let God, our trust in God's providence be faith.

May that be a lesson for Solomon the seventh Sunday after Pentecost, in the name of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit. [00:23:00] Amen.
