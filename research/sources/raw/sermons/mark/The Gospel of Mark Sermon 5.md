# Gospel of Mark Sermon 5

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we we're gonna continue our study of the Gospel of Mark. Together we're entering into an interesting phase. I, I told you, uh, that the Gospel of Mark sets up a confrontation by Jesus with all of the major groups who were impeding. God's desire for justice. And uh, today we're going to encounter the stories in which, uh, we see Jesus now pivoting from his acceptance of his mission, his temptation, his acceptance of his mission and his, his initial foray into Capernaum, uh, and then time it for prayer in the wilderness, and then now reengaging.

And now actually. Conducting something like an assault, if you will. And, and when I use that word I'm talking about, uh, something that I'll be talking about later actually. The Freedom Writers as one example in our time when, when, uh, [00:01:00] Christians, uh, made a decision to engage in order to disrupt, um, the social order.

That was depriving, uh, many, many Christians of life. Uh, and, and I'm referring to, uh, the period in the right, right about the time I was born, uh, when, when, uh, they challenged guys like John Lewis and other freedom writers challenged the segregation laws on interstate. Uh, bus travel. Uh, so we'll be talking more about that in a little bit.

But, uh, important point is that Jesus is engaging in this, uh, in, in the stories you read today, one of those particular groups, and that is the group that we've called Scribes. And I've, I've mentioned to you, um, in, in, in the Translation by Eugene Peterson that Tom read to us of, of this gospel lesson. Uh, Peterson translates it as, uh, religious scholars.

And I, I wanna suggest to you that that's not really a helpful. Translation to the extent that it makes it about [00:02:00] religion. Uh, the scribes certainly were about, uh, they were those of, of any political party that had the authority, the power to interpret the rules, uh, by which the community lived. Um, and so scribes certainly would've included religious scholars, but it's a, it's a more broad group, certainly in our time today, uh, particularly when I, when we hear, uh, about our cancel culture.

About wokeness and all these other things. We see folks, you know, acting as scribes, trying to, uh, guide us in the way we are to live by interpreting the, uh, United States Constitution, our values, and, and, and other. Uh, other, other aspects of our culture in order to guide the way, uh, we should live. So, uh, scribes, let's interpret scribes more, um, broadly as we encounter these stories today.

I wanna get into this by talking about the debt code. Uh, we're gonna actually talk about two things. The debt. Code and the [00:03:00] purity code. A little bit of background information, uh, that's really important for us to understand this story and what Jesus is doing, and to see the profound nature of what we read today in Mark's gospel.

Um, the debt code, uh, was, uh, something that was a, a part of, um, the, the, the culture of, uh, of Palestine. Uh, and it, it, it arises from Torah. And if you remember the story of Cain and Abel, where, uh, there was a struggle in the garden Eden over, over honor and glory and, and, and, uh, who God loves more than each other.

And of course, Kane Slew Abel, uh, you know, the debt code is, is aimed at helping the people control those impulses, uh, uh, that it caused us to be. Aggressive with one another and to deprive others of life in, in the possibility of flourishing. Uh, it is the, the debt code is, uh, the basis of our covenantal relationship with God.

It is, it [00:04:00] describes our debt to God. You know, our, our debt of, of God arises from God's providential nature, and it also describes our covenantal relationship with each other. Purpose is. To help of the debt code was for, uh, the Jews to promote, uh, the justice that God desires for us to be blessed with, uh, throughout the community.

Uh, and it does that by regulating the way we live. Uh, and, and the premise underlying the debt code is the, is God's providence. The fact that we, that, uh, we make our daily bread, well, the, the, you know, the daily, most of our daily bread is actually made by God in the, in the and through the sunshine and the rain and the, and the seeds and the wheat that then grows.

We have. Roles to play, but the beginning point of all that is we receive life as a gift. We receive our sustenance as a gift, and, uh, and, and, and gr uh, grace is [00:05:00] the source of all of our blessings that, that sustain us. And because of that, uh, the debt code then carries forth in saying that, well. Just as God gives to us, we too are to carry on that gift giving practice.

And we are to give to, especially to all those who lack sustenance and, and, um, and that means, uh, if we do that, if we live in such a world where we take responsibility, uh, for sharing our bread with others, well then we avoid the issues that the 10 Commandments describe. Coveting our neighbor's property, coveting the life that our neighbor has.

It is so much better than my life. Have you ever felt that before? Have you ever said, I am so sick of my life. I want a life like hers. Uh, helps us to avoid those kinds of things and other blessings, including those that are more materialism. So, so as a result of the debt code, [00:06:00] what we hear. In, in, in the recounting of the law, it says that you know, Hey, of course there won't be any poor persons among you.

If you do what I say, you won't have this problem. Let there be no poor among you, is the way this is most often translated. Deuteronomy 15 verse four. Of course, there won't be any poor persons among you because the Lord will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance.

But. Only if you obey these instructions about how to live. So the debt code is an important facet. And, and it's, it's, it, uh, it is what created a social hierarchy. It's created what? It's, what created the, the structures of, uh. Society, this, this indebtedness to God and indebtedness to this to each other, organized, uh, the, you know, the life of, of ancient Israel and, and of the Jews and Jesus' time.

And it was, and it, and I wanted to, [00:07:00] to clarify in, in order to distinguish it from our own situation today, it was rooted in an understanding about reciprocity. Also an understanding about this gift exchange, uh, and it, and it pre opposed the ideal of forgiveness. Love your neighbor as yourself and in, in, in, in, in real practical terms that, uh, in that forgiveness of, of debts was manifest in things like every seven years.

Um, being, uh, being freed of your, uh, your, your servitude if you had become a slave, and then the great Jubilee every 50 years, uh, in which, uh, you were freed of all debts. Uh, they were all just Neil, so that we all were able to be free of those, our debts to each other and then begin a new life. And of course, social power, we've talked about this before in this time, was based on.

Uh, something of a caste system, uh, but [00:08:00] certainly upon family, uh, groups, uh, bloodlines, much like, uh, we see in, in parts of our world today. Now, uh, lest you say that we don't have a debt code, I wanna remind you that we in America have something very similar, but ours isn't rooted in this gift exchange notion, nor is it really as an, as Americans rooted in forgiveness.

Uh, though we Christians. Who are American, hopefully root our citizenship in forgiveness. Uh, ours is rooted instead in something we call the social contract this way of living under law together. Uh, and also in this mechanism we that, that our freedom creates called market exchange. And, and what that then creates, because it's a different.

It's a different basis of society. It creates a, a social power that is not based on your kinship or your class, but rather on your ability to impact the markets that are the basis of our sustenance, your ability to, to impact, [00:09:00] including that the, the labor markets in my ability. To, uh, have social mobility, which we're gonna be talking about.

So it's a very different basis for us. And we also have things that, uh, that are, that relate to the things we're gonna be talking about today. Uh, there are things that, that in addition to, um, you know, the, the economic deaths, when we hear deaths, we hear the. You know, forgive us our debts. We, we often, um, think in economic terms, and I would say most of us almost exclusively think that that's referring to economic debts.

But, but you can think about even in our society, we have moral debts such as the one that several of us, uh, satisfied in terms of American citizenship, uh, by serving in the military. Uh, uh, some of you may have sort served in the Peace Corps. Finding ways. Many of you I do know, are very actively and have been, continue to be involved in serving the community, certainly through the church.

Um, one other duty that, uh, one other duty in the sense of debt that, that we have is, uh, that, that, that [00:10:00] underlies our social contract and our market economy is that we will listen to experts, uh, that we will submit ourselves to. So there is a bit of a hierarchy based on professionalism that we have in our country.

So that's the debt code, and that's something that we're gonna see Jesus engaging in a really fundamental way, uh, today in our story. So next I wanna talk about the purity code. And, uh, the purity code is all about. Ordering the material world around us. Now, if you think that, we don't think that, I want you to imagine, uh, how would you feel if I came and dumped a, a big shovel, full of manure right there on your carpet, in your living room when I visited you?

Um, you would probably have some problem with that, and that implies, uh, that there is a purity code that I would be, um, provoking. I would be, um, I. Violating that is implicit that it may not be even aware of. But, but there are a lot of little rules that we have. You know, if I came and I put my shoes on your dining room table, if you [00:11:00] found, uh, if, you know, if you, you came to someone's house and you saw that they, they were keeping cooking utensils in the bedroom or, or if you see somebody just at the store and they got food.

Uh, on their clothing, or even if you're talking to your loved ones and you say, eh, you got something right here. You're, you're really acting in the form of a purity codes. Things are out of order. Uh, another example, if you had bathroom equipment, uh, in your family room, you'd say, eh, that's, that's not clean.

Uh, and, but, but same, same token, what if you saw somebody. You know, walking nude or walking out, uh, in the, in the neighborhood, just in what is obviously their underwear. It would provoke something in you, trigger something in you that would say something is not right here. And that's what purity codes are all about.

Now, in the time of Jesus, the Jewish ordering, uh, was based upon. Uh, you know, there, there were pretty, pretty regimented order of, of, um, [00:12:00] how the world was ordered in terms of purity, and there was a ranking that, that the rabbinical literature shows us. And if you notice at the very top in terms of ranking, in terms of.

The most pure, uh, would be priest. And if you notice, you go down that list, uh, you know, there the Israelites are number three. And so there are people who are not Israelites, uh, that might be, uh, converts to, uh, Judaism. You got slaves and you got people who have had some form of physical malady, some form of physical.

Um, uh, challenges that would be, you know, less pure. And then you have, uh, those without a penis, uh, which, which, which ought to concern us. You've noticed at the very bottom of that cleanliness would be females. Um, so in the, in terms of, uh, purity, uh, and so you, you know, you, you probably have seen this and, and read about this and even in today's society where it would've been an appropriate, uh.

For, uh, the, the [00:13:00] Cyro Venetian woman to come up to Jesus within their society and initiate a conversation, uh, that would be violating a, a, a sense of their social order. Similarly, their sp they or they regimented their space. So there was a purity ranking in certain, in terms of space that began at the very top was the Holy of Holies.

That's where you encountered God and only one person a year was allowed to go into the Holy Holies with, which is within the temple in Jerusalem. But then beneath that, uh, you see it, it it basically, it'd be like taking a walk from the Holy Holies out from the temple. So you go. From the sanctuary, then you go out the porch in the altar, then you go into a, and you're descending in these, these courts that are part of the temple, uh, architecture through the court of the priest.

Then down below another uh, uh, setting, uh, on the terrace, the court of the Israelites, and then another terrace, the court of women. And then you, then you descend the temple mount and you. And then as, and then, and then the whole world is ordered because you go, uh, [00:14:00] within Jerusalem and then, then all the cities that are of Israel or the Promised Land, and then everything else, you know.

So in terms of purity, there, there, you know, the fur you get from Jerusalem, the less pure you are, uh, in there, in, in a sense of, uh, of boundaries. And, uh, and so think about if you're, there are stories taking place in Glee very far. From, um, from, uh, the temple. So that made it pretty low in that ranking. And you also had pollution and, you know, and sort of like the manure example I gave, uh, that came from contact with things.

And so the worst kind, uh, the, the, the, the most egregious thing would be to contact someone else with your own. Semen or urine or spit or anything, you know, several of those bodily fluids of your own. Um, uh, and, and the next would be for you to touch a woman who is menstruating and then touch anything.

Anyone who, who's, who's touching a dead thing, whether [00:15:00] it's a human or, or an animal, all of those things would be considered unclean. You would be by very, by, very by the very act of touching them. You yourself would be contaminated, would be unclean. And the problem with that is you need to become ritually cleansed.

Similarly, there was a hierarchy of time there in terms of purity. So the whole list of all days is the Sabbath day. And then you see the rankings there of of the various Holy days passed over the day of atonement all the way down to Roshana and then all other days. And so that meant that there were certain days that were set apart for you to give to God and not to other things.

If you violated those things well then you are doing something that is impure and that threatened the whole community. I just wanna mention that, um, this pollution behavior, when we feel that there is something that is polluting us, well, it's our reaction when we are simply condemning. An idea or an [00:16:00] object and, and, and, uh, and because that idea is likely to confuse our, um, challenge our most cherished classifications by which we are ordering our world and, and, uh, and so we can, we call things unclean.

Yes. We call things clean and unclean in, uh, in, in the Bible, but the, but in our own society, we have this notion of clean and unclean categories. Uh, if you listen to the podcast, uh, you've heard, uh, Dr. Boyle talk about the very notion, our use of language of white whiteness, white and black. And so the opposite, you know, white being pure and good.

Well, the opposite of that is the name that, uh, in our society we have given. To those people that we enslaved and then become free legally. Uh, and, and, and, but we've created a, a hierarchy of human value just with our language there, this notion of clean and unclean. [00:17:00] And in terms of our purity codes, uh, you know, we still have this type of, of, uh, purity code at work in our own country.

I would suggest just by looking at the fact that we are more segregated today than in our schools, than we were. When, when I was going to school in, in the 1970s when the, when the Supreme Court, uh, ordered federal, uh, you know, ordered busing of our public schools, uh, well, we're, we're now more segregated than we were before that.

And in our communities, uh, the most segregated community in the United States is Milwaukee. Uh, and, uh, we have become increasingly segregated. In, in, uh, in Chicago, Milwaukee, you know, you know many, many, many parts of our country, uh, such that, um, it affects people's opportunity to flourish. And we're gonna be talking about that.

Now, the problem with all this, this debt code and this, this purity code, if you are one of those people that the Bible calls the people of the land, that is the, the people who were the. [00:18:00] Peasantry, the people who are not artisan class or above. Uh, well, it's, it, it's, it's a, it's a real problem for you to conform with all these rules, uh, because it's, it's, it's very expensive.

You know, the daily work that's available to you, um, would expose you to being contaminated, contain, you know, becoming, you know, uh, uh. Exposure to contagion. Like, uh, for example, in the, in the, in India, if you're familiar with the untouchables, one of the tasks given to the Untouchables is they deal with the, uh, human feces and, and that makes them unclean.

Well, so too, there were people who dealt, dealt on a daily basis with the dead. Uh, and these were the jobs that were. Were, uh, left to the folks, uh, who didn't have all the land and all the wealth, and, and that was, so there are many jobs, whether you're tanning, leather, or anything like that, that would make you unclean just as a part of your work.

Um, and, uh, and it becomes expensive to, to, uh, comply with what the, [00:19:00] what the faith requires in, in terms of, of becoming, you know, you know, becoming clean so that you can enter into, uh, the redemptive space of the temple. Uh, you have, first of all, if you live in Galilee, you have to walk eight days. Uh, and then you have to, you have to submit yourself to someone who's in power over you, who has the ability to say yes or no to you, and then offer them something of financial.

Uh, you have to do a gift exchange. You have to. It may be just a mite, it may be a pigeon, it may be a lamb, it may be a bull. You have to offer something. Uh, and then, then you become, you, you are declared clean, and then so you're able to access the redemptive spaces of the temple. So it's expensive, and so you don't get great compliance.

Uh, and, and the other problem with that is it's a power game. You, if you are, of that 90% who were the peasantry, you're the people of the land. Well, the, the ones who are making the rules about [00:20:00] how you, how you are able to move about and, and, and just live are those people that we call scribes. Because they're the ones who are interpreting all the rules about, uh, pollution, about, about, about purity and uh, and the debt code.

And one of the distinctions between the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the Essenes and the other political parties, just as uh, we have distinctions between the Democrats and the Republicans and, and other parties in the United States, was how liberally, uh, the parties believed we should provide access to.

Our redemptive media to to, to our means of grace, uh, to to, to our means of of, of flourishing. How liberally should we provide that? So I wanna give you an example. I've been reading a biography of Martin Luther King that is absolutely fascinating. And I've been reading about the Freedom Riders, and there's this, this, during the story of the Freedom Riders, you probably guys probably remember it.

Uh, the Freedom Riders are the [00:21:00] ones who were testing the, um, the rules of segregation in various spaces. But in this particular space, it had to do with an interest. Interstate travel on buses. Of course, you know, if you're traveling interstate on buses, you, you get on a bus in Georgia, you and you, and you go through Alabama.

You're gonna, the bus is gonna stop and it's gonna stop in Birmingham, and it's gonna stop in Montgomery and it's gonna stop in, uh, before that. It's gonna stop in Aniston. Uh, and, uh, and as you, as you get off the bus to catch, you know, to use the bathroom to get some food, et cetera, uh, you enter into a waiting room, you immediately encounter waiting rooms that we're, we're segregated.

So one of the things that was fascinating to me was, uh. The Freedom Riders got off the bus. Let's just take, we could take the example of Aniston Birmingham or Montgomery, 'cause it happened in all three places, but I'm talking about Birmingham. 'cause this was a serious event. They get off, uh, their, and then they, the, the, uh, white segregationists knew that they were coming and had mast.

Uh, [00:22:00] uh, en Rage. They were carrying lead pipes and knives and bricks, and also other types of, of instruments of violence. And as the Freedom Riders got off the bus, there was a big riot. The, their suitcases ended up being burned. There were, there were, uh, now white and black Freedom Riders. Uh, and, and, uh, they ended up getting pounded hit with bricks and hit with lead pipes.

Uh, one of Bobby Kennedy's, uh. Uh, who Attorney General Bobby Kennedy's, uh, assistant, his executive assistant, uh, got hit with a lead pipe and, and was concussed. But there was this incredible outrage. And what precipitated the event was that there were white freedom writers and black freedom writers who sat together, uh.

The waiting room, and that was what provoked it. And there was this violation of the way that the, that we had ordered our society in the South at that time. That was just simply unacceptable. It was a great threat to all. Well, this, as a result of this, right, there were all these injuries and so the, these.

Freedom Riders were trying to escape and in order [00:23:00] to escape, they, there were some taxi rider there. There were, there were some black-owned taxis. There were some white-owned taxis, but they had a rule that said if you were a black taxi driver, you must not let a white person in your taxi or you'll lose your license and vice versa.

And so they're trying to escape. They go to the taxi and there's a white freedom Rider and a black Freedom rider. They all get into the taxi. They're just trying to escape the mob, and the black taxi rider won't let the white person in the taxi because he knows that he himself will be attacked for allowing these two things, this white and this black people.

To mix in a taxi. Uh, and this was 1960? Uh, yeah, 1960. 1961. Uh, when this happened, I believe, I'm not quite sure of the dates, but, uh, it was right about then. Um, and then, and then so as a result of all these injuries, uh, that there was a white hospital, that, that, uh, because of their law of segregation, would not take any of the black casualties, could not.

Because that would violate the way that the society, the way we had ordered [00:24:00] our society. And, uh, and, and, and when, when asked why the governor, uh, when, when the governor was asked, when the chief of police was asked, when the, uh, state, uh, police, uh, uh, uh. Head was asked, you know, why, why did you not stop the mob?

Uh, they would, their language would continually excuse the mob because that their responsibility wasn't to stop, uh, wasn't to protect the freedom riders free access to places. Their responsibility by law was to enforce the segregation laws of the state of Alabama. So, uh, lest we think that we are free of any of these pollution codes, these purity codes, uh, it's it's part of our lifetime.

And, and I would maintain that those things still exist, although they're no longer in law. Thankfully, all of this is background for us to now enter into our story and see what Jesus does when he encounters. This type of distorted, [00:25:00] uh, way of life, this, this way of taking the, the blessings that God has given and distorting them through a, a wrongly ordered, uh, society in which the people of the land are not allowed to, to be, to benefit from the blessings that God attempts.

And so what we see is that a man with skin disease approached Jesus. He fell to his knees and begged, if you want. You can make me clean. Now, as we read that, what we ought to know is that, well, this is a, this is a person, uh, the, the, the Bible uses the word for leprosy. It could be any of Leviticus, it could be any of 70 skin disorders.

Um, and, uh, and so, so in most translations, it calls this person a leper. Uh, and, and, and. A leper is someone who has a contagious disease, but in order to be made clean, well, no one can make them clean. Uh, there was no cure, [00:26:00] but the only person who had the authority to declare them clean was a priest. A priest member of the highest purity code down there in Jerusalem.

So, but this man came to Jesus and seeing something in him with faith, perhaps having heard the stories about him, says he's, he gives in a word of faith that we're gonna see again and again. If I just know, if you wanted to Jesus, you could make me clean. You could have the authority to declare me to do that, which only priest can do.

Jesus. It says, incensed. Incensed, and, and, and, and we believe the, uh, scholars will, will usually say that the, the, he's incensed at what he knows. This person has gone through the fact that there is a leper. He's clearly been, uh, trying to operate within the hierarchy, and he's, he's feels without hope. He's, he's in despair.

He is a leper. He's segregated from the rest of the people. He can't go into the temple. He can't, he can't do the things that most of us can do. And Jesus did [00:27:00] something that is where I, this is where I'm describing an assault on the, the, uh, symbolic order. Jesus does that which he absolutely must not do.

He touches the man, he dares to do that, which, uh, society says you must not do. He was now, he made himself unclean according to the social order. But instead what happened is he touched him and he says, I do want to be clean and instantly. The disease left him and he was clean. Now, this is quite remarkable.

This is an, this was an instantaneous cleansing, but, uh, of, of disease. But it was something that was absolutely unheard of in history. Uh, this capacity and, and, and, and doing this was akin to raising someone from the dead because a leper. Was essentially someone who was dead just waiting on the clock to run out, uh, in, in, in a very short order.

Um, and then Jesus sent him away and again, [00:28:00] sternly, and he says, now go back to the people that I know you've already been to because you have to be before you can be declared unclean. Don't say anything to anyone. Go and now do what the law says. Show yourself to the priest. He will see for himself that now you were clean and let him, uh, formally welcome you back into our society, offer the sacrifice that that is required.

In other words, do the gift giving that you were required to do for your cleansing, that is now actually, uh, something that is happened. And, uh, just your act will show those scribes that they. Do not have the power. They do not have the authority to do that, which I have just done. So he's challenged the power that describes are claiming for themselves here.

So then later we see that Jesus is a Capernaum. We have a different story now. A couple days have passed and, uh, and, and the, uh, reading in this [00:29:00] by, by, uh, Tom from Eugene Peterson's. The message, again, uses the word paraplegic. The, the, uh, the person was, uh, paralytic. The person was immobilized, and he was, he was laying in something like a, a poor man's blanket are soldiers.

Bed roll kind of thing. That's how they carried him. That's what the words are in the Greek. Uh, we don't know what the cause was. So paraplegic is probably not a helpful translation. It could have been anything that causes us to be immobilized. Now, I would, uh, urge us to read this story, to hear this story in a very broad sense because there's some things that can immobilize us that are not just about our legs.

But we can be just in the fetal position because of what life has done to us. Uh, we have both physical and mental disorders that do this to us. And so let's say as we, as we read this story and we perhaps experience those things, let's put ourselves in that story. These men, his friends, uh, can't get through the crowd.

So they, they, they go to this roof. Now in, in the architecture, the roof is, um. [00:30:00] Is is a flat earth in roof with, uh, with some, some beams and then they just filled it in with sod and so they excavated. It must have been real interesting if you're part of the crowd down there below and you say, oh my gosh, someone is, uh, is, is digging through the roof.

It doesn't, mark doesn't tell us much about that. That must have been a fascinating part of the story, but no, what he pays attention to is what happens when they had an opening, they were able to lower the man's bed roll and, and, and, and the man saw. His friend's. Faith is not the man's faith in this time, and he simply looks at the man and says, child, your sins are forgiven.

I. Now again, as the scribes spoke immediately, and you know, they, they saw what was happening and they started muttering, said, ha, how can he speak this way? He, he, this is blasphemy. That's the, that was the thing that scribes could pronounce, that the priest could pronounce blasphemy, was the thing that they were to protect the people from.

That was their job. We must not allow blasphemy because that's an offense to God. And so they're saying [00:31:00] basically, Jesus, if Jesus is saying. That he is forgiving these sins. Well then he is blaspheming and I'm mentioning that. I want you to remember that because if you look forward to this, actually look back to Good Friday.

You look forward to when we get to the end of the gospel, mark blasphemy is what Jesus is going to be convicted of. That'll lead to his crucifixion. So this is the first time we see this in the gospel. Why does he speak this way? Only the one true God can forgive him, can forgive sins. This is blasphemy.

So now the scribes have been, have gotten the memo. They know this, Jesus is going to be challenging and threatening their authority, and he does it right away. Immediately Jesus recognizes what they're talking about, and he says to them, why do you fill your mind with all these, these questions? What's easier to say to a paralyzed person?

Your sins are forgiven. Or to say, get up. Take up your bed and walk. But so you'll know that the human one has authority on earth. [00:32:00] The human one comes from Daniel seven, the human one. Is the, is the one that God would send someday to deliver the people of the land from their, they're being ravaged by the classes above them, that, that take advantage of them.

Uh, and so Jesus is, is naming him, naming himself here, the human one, that Messianic character from Daniel seven, so that you will know that the human one has authority on earth to forgive sins. He said to the man who was paralyzed, get up, take your mat, and go home. And of course, that's what happened, folks.

The people of the land are suffering. The people of our land are suffering our, my apologies. Social. I couldn't hear what you said. Our social contract and market exchange political economy aren't working. Uh, we have a presumption that it, that, that it will work. We presumed when we. We [00:33:00] organized our particular society that there would be equal opportunity for, for all.

But we knew from the beginning that that wasn't real. It was more of an aspiration from the beginning. 'cause we, when we said all men are created equal, we knew that that was not in fact where we, I. Started, it's where we wanted to go, and it's who we promised to become as the American people for all the world.

We would be a a, you know that, that, that city on the hill, that's what we said we would do, but we we're not done yet. We've not gotten there yet because certain people within our land, certain people of the land, just as in the in, in the times of Jesus. Fail to thrive and they fail to thrive because of the symbolic order that we ourselves have constructed, and it's one that favors disproportionately white males.

Here's a, a, a chart that if you, if you, uh, read the. Uh, the essay I wrote about this, uh, you've seen this, this is a data from Raj Chetty, a [00:34:00] professor from Harvard, and I just wanted you to notice it's a, what it shows is the ranking, um, uh, in terms of household income, uh, by, uh, these, uh, racial groups. And it, what it's looking at is our mobility, our generational mobility.

So we say, you know, we wanna have upward mobility for, you know, for all. And what, what you notice here is at the very top of the income spread in the United States are, are Asian natives. And, uh, and then, and then US whites. Um, and, and then, uh, we see that we, the, that there is good mobility. The one group that is having good positive upward mobility in our society, uh, right now are the Hispanics.

But if you look down towards the left, you see two groups that are just stuck in generational poverty. Blacks and American Indians, and we have to ask ourselves why. Now there's a great, I'm not gonna [00:35:00] go into that now, but there's a, there's an awful lot of good information about that, uh, that, that, that, uh, helps us to understand why this is true.

The, the point and point is that we can do something about it, and we ought to 'cause we are to carry on Jesus' work. We are the body of Christ Jesus in our story today. We see him disrupting the symbolic order. Going in and saying, I have the authority. I have the power to make a difference, and so I will, your sins are forgiven.

Get up off your mat and walk and, and, and doing that kind of healing. That's the work that we are called to do as the church. We may not know the answers, but we do know the question, how can we disrupt this hierarchical worldview that causes. This to be the fate, generation after generation for blacks and American Indians in our communities.

And then I think the questions we need to ask are how do our notions, our own, uh, explicit and implicit notions of [00:36:00] purity in debt, as I've discussed them today, factor in to their struggles? How are we making it harder and how can we disrupt those as Jesus did? That's the question. I don't have the answers, but we ought to be focusing on that question is, is what I think, uh, arises, uh, is the learning, I think that arises from this gospel lesson today.

And so the end of the story, Jesus raised him up. Right away, he picked up his mat and walked out in front of everybody. And then it says the alos, the people of the land, the they and theirs, the people of the land, the, the ones that had solidarity with Jesus more than anyone else. The, the poor, the disenfranchised.

That's the, that's the ones they're talking about here. The, they were all amazed and they praised God saying, we've never seen anything like this. Brothers and sisters of St. Stephens let us follow [00:37:00] Jesus in asking the right questions about our time, about our symbolic ordering of our world, and let's ask how we can make a difference so that the people of the land, uh, see the work that we are do, that we do and are amazed and saying, we've never seen anything like this.

God is good. God is good all the time. The name of the Father, son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen.
