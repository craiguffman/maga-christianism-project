# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 22

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we are continuing in our walkthrough, the Gospel of Mark, and we have us today with us, uh, uh, recollection of, uh, some of Jesus's most famous parables. I, I, I want us to think back to all we've been through, uh, and imagine what it must have been like for those disciples, is that just before Jesus took them out.

Uh, onto the boat. 'cause that's the scene here, right? We are all in the nave, all we're all in the boat together. And Jesus has stood up and preached to them away from the crowds. Uh, and the precipitating event that caused him to go into the boats, as we talked about last week, was. This sudden turn of events, um, where they were now at risk, where the, the authorities were, um, in solidarity in regarding the necessity of putting an end to this movement, this Jesus movement that had, had, uh, gathered people from, you know, [00:01:00] from many hundreds of miles away to be a part of what Jesus was doing.

And so I wanted you to think back with me to how this story began. Now Jesus, uh, called them and you know, you know when, when they heard the word, whom shall I ascend? Uh uh, and, and they said, here I am Lord. Uh, that was to this, this, uh, Jesus who walked along the, the beach at the Sea of Galilee as they mended their nets and said, come along with me and I'll make you.

Fishers of humans, and, and we talked about what that meant and the excitement and how they dropped their careers to pursue the dream of helping Jesus change the world. They believed in his proclamation about the kingdom of God, that God reigns only and always through the way of love, and, and they'd seen the transformations, you know, they'd seen his power over Satan.

Through, uh, through all sorts of interactions, including exorcisms that were in and out of, uh, the synagogue [00:02:00] and through, um, the healings that he, he was able to do both by touching and by just speaking a word, uh, and, and, and how the crowds came from all corners of the earth. He of the earth, east, west, north, and south.

And so there, there was a sense that time was ripe. Time was ripe at last. God was breaking into the world to deliver them from the oppression that that, uh, was a great weight upon them. You could feel the crispness of it in the air, uh, the promise of it all. God was at last acting to throw off oppression and, and to bring about God's justice.

And they were called to, to be a part of it, and they were committed to, to being a part of it. But then came the inevitable pushback. Pushback from, uh, from Satan, from the established orders in Galilee, from the established order in Jerusalem, Herod and his Herodians, in an unlikely [00:03:00] alliance with the minority party, the, the Pharisees in Galilee.

And then, uh, you know, plotting to get rid of Jesus. And then the scribes coming up from Jerusalem 90 miles away. You know, like coming from Washington, DC. Um, and, and they were now actively pursuing a PR strategy, condemning Jesus' movement, condemning Jesus himself, saying he's like, Sable, accusing him of a capital crime.

A crime for which death was the rightful penalty. I. Blasphemy, as we talked about, that's actually what a charge will be held against him eventually. So things were getting real. Things were getting real, and the romance of it all seemed suddenly distant. It always seemed distant, doesn't it? When those in authority pushed back, pushed back, uh, um.

God had not trampled out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored. It seemed God [00:04:00] wasn't doing God's part. You, you wouldn't be experiencing the rage of the established order in response to Jesus's proclamation about a new kingdom. If God were doing God's work. There was a sense of of being, uh, alone.

Have you ever felt like that? We, we dream big dreams. At times, at least I do. I hope you do. I'm sure you do. As, as as I do, we, we commence big adventures. We imagine how our lives will be transformed by these, these adventures, not just our individual lives, but our collective lives. How at last, the joy and the contentment for which we've always yearned will draw close and we will bask in Its heavenly.

Glow. And so like those disciples, we pursue our dream, but then the powers and principalities strike back and they strike back hard and they shatter. At least they seek to shatter our romantic vision. [00:05:00] They seek to set us off course from pursuing those dreams that would change their lives in ways they don't want.

Right now I've on my mind, uh. My son Andrew, he and Amanda, his wife, just had a baby, uh, this week. Uh, Freddy, we call him. And, uh, well, you guys know what, what that's like having a baby. How you anticipate, what it's gonna be like, how you look forward to that day, and when that day comes. Uh, suddenly you're, you're hit by the reality of being parents for the first time.

Uh, in their case, some complications arose, so the delivery didn't end up being as easy as, as they might have imagined. And, and then, and based on the interactions, uh, with my son, it, it appears that the, you know, the baby feeds really well, but cries is an awful lot. And so sleep has become a struggle. And so they're in that phase that, that most of us here in this.

Uh, gathering of experience, [00:06:00] not all, but most of us. Uh, in which, in which you're saying, so what do I do now? You reach out to your, to your loved ones and say, what did you do? And in the fog of our sleeplessness, suddenly this romantic vision seems harder than we imagined it would be. Next weekend, ine and I are gonna go down to Richmond and see our.

Uh, my daughter Kelly and, uh, and her fiance John, get married and in a very similar way, they have a romantic vision. They, they have a house with a garden. They have great jobs, and they have a love that's been tempered and strengthened through the years. And, and so right now they're ready to stand together and they, they share a romantic dream about the life that they are already constructing together.

Um, they, uh. They are excited. Of course they have a, a sense of, of reality. Uh, but, uh, they, they don't know what's ahead [00:07:00] of them and, uh, they, they stand together, uh, about, you know, concerned about and thinking about dreaming about the life that they're gonna construct together that's gonna fill their lives with meaning and peace and joy.

But, but yet our lives never turn out exactly the way we imagine they will. Do they? Sometimes, not always, but sometimes our own sin trips us up and instead of reaping the grand harvest of bliss that we imagined, we reap the whirlwind. Sometimes it's the powers and principalities that strike back. We humans create.

Many, many blessings. And we also create many curses. And as we've spoken about, sometimes our creations betray their vocation for the good and spawn as much evil as good. And, and when many, and when many of our ambiguous creations linked together in a web of systems, well, they become. Domination systems that are so [00:08:00] entrenched in our culture that they become like furniture.

We don't even see that. We don't even notice them until like Dick Van Dyke. We stumble over them, uh, going about our life and we cry out when those systems bruise us. Sometimes our dreams don't end up the way we expected. Sometimes they don't seem to be on track. Sometimes it's our doing and sometimes it's the evil we create, and sometimes it's simply the reality of life in which the same rain that reigns upon all of us creates floods that overwhelm us.

And the same sun that shines upon us all creates mutations that attack our spirit and ravage our mind. Ravage our bodies and, and, and we cry out with, with these bruises. But God created us to be free. [00:09:00] He also created us finite. He also created us as persons, uh, who, who, who don't exist except in personal relationships.

Uh, we, we experience things personally. So when these things happen that make our lives turn out differently than we planned, we experience those. Those events personally, it feels personal. It stings and sometimes the weight of it all feels like a giant boulder that's landed. Landed just upon us, crushing the air out of us so that we can't breathe.

And at the end of the day, I. That's the minimum that any of us really want, isn't it Just to have space and the ability to breathe when we can't breathe because of how the world responds to our dreams, we take it personally. Hm. Where is God in all this? What's God doing? Why isn't God doing God's job? Why is [00:10:00] God allowing these things to happen to me?

Does God care about me, like God cares about everyone else? Why is life so much harder for me right now? Than it is for others who don't face this steep and rocky path that I see looming before me. I imagine that that's what it must have been like for those disciples, and Jesus must have had a pastoral sense of that because what do we know?

We, as we said, we talked about last week, he took 'em off into a boat. And he addressed them and he, and he told them parable a series of parables in his preaching. And, and the one we talked about last week was where he said, Hey guys, this word that we're, that I'm proclaiming this word about the way of love, I'm proclaiming, uh, not, it's not, it's not gonna.

Uh, elicit the same response from everybody. It's gonna, for some people, it's just gonna generate resistance. You just gotta expect, that's the way it is. It's the nature of this [00:11:00] word that I'm giving you to preach and teach and share. It's the nature of this word. It's inherently polarizing because, uh, it, it, it judges us.

The word itself judges us and causes us to take a stance. And then he tells us these parables today that, uh, Judy just read to us and I just wanna drill into them 'cause I think there's an important thing. And then just to make a few points today, and a couple things I think that Jesus is telling his disciples and, and telling us today, you know, the first is that in spite of the way things seem to be, in spite of our sense that we ourselves have had a horrible life, that we ourselves have been forsaken.

Well, that's not the truth about us and it's not the truth about what's happening in our lives. And so he tells this story first about the, about the, uh, someone scattering seed on the ground. He, he says The kingdom of God is like someone scattered seed on the ground and, and then, and then would [00:12:00] sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow.

Of course, that's the way it really is if you're a gardener, right? We don't do much of the work except scatter the sea, because as we sleep, God does most of the work the earth produces of itself. First, the stalked in the head, then the full grain in the head, but when the grain is ripe. We do have our part to do in the making of our daily bread.

We, uh, grab our sickle because it's our part of the work. It's our time to do the harvest of what God is doing. Um, yeah. Uh, God is, is in spite of things, God, even while we sleep, is working to bring about the good. This is the very essence of. Sabbath. This is why God causes calls us to rest so that we learn to appreciate this, this fact of human life, that even as we sleep, God never ceases to bring, do the [00:13:00] work that is necessary to bring us to the good, to bring us to the bread that we need, and, and the bread for which we yearned all nature of bread, uh, to bring all of the good that we need in order to sustain us.

We have a role to play in it. In spite of appearances, God is always acting to bring about that good. You are never alone even when it feels like you have been forsaken. That's the truth. And then secondly, in spite of appearances.

We are not actually going through, uh, the catastrophe that, uh, that we, we, that we've seen, uh, that that seems to be, uh, being visited upon us, that in spite of appearances, God's word is gonna prevail. It will not return empty. Uh, the way of love, this way of love that is so, so difficult to pursue. Will ultimately prevail.

And he [00:14:00] tells this with this interesting parable, this so familiar parable about the mustard seed. And so again, he compares the kingdom. He says, Hey guys, this, when, when, when The reign of God, when, when God reigns in your heart, when this way of love becomes the thing that, that the characterizes you. Well, you know what it's like, it, it, it's like, it's like a mustard seed when sort of on the ground it grows up and becomes the, the greatest of all shrubs.

And I wanna focus on first, on that second part of this parable. A lot of times we focus on the mustard seed and the mustard shrub and all that. But let's fo first focus on that second part where, where Jesus says the kingdom of, of, of, of God, uh, is like that mustard teeth. When it becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in the shade.

In order for us to understand this comparison, I wanted to just ask us to focus on this 'cause this is a, this is what we call a scriptural echo. We're [00:15:00] familiar with scriptural quotes where there's literally word for word scripture, uh, being quoted, uh, from the, the scriptures that Jesus and his followers knew at the time.

The Hebrew scriptures, which we call 'em. Sometimes there are allusions to that. Sometimes though there are echoes, and this is a scriptural echo. It would be a, an example of an echo would be, if I were to say to you, uh, yeah, the other day, uh, uh, had to talk to my son about cutting down that cherry tree, you know, each of you would instantly recognize my echoing that that part of our American folklore in which George Washington cut that.

Cut down that cherry tree. So what we have here is a, is an echo of stories of of, of scriptural metaphors that we're so familiar that everyone in Jesus's audience would've recognized it. And that is this notion of birds of the air can make nest in its shade. And so we see it in several places, uh, but, but first we see it in Ezekiel and Ze.

And so when Jesus makes this. Script echo. He's reminding of this, these people who are [00:16:00] yearning for deliverance from the Roman Empire and the oppression of the hero Rodian kingdom and, and the lifting up of all these things that are causing them to live in ungodly ways. They're, they're, they're yearning for that, but yet it's not happening.

And they're, they're starting to doubt whether it'll ever happen. And so with this little reference, Jesus uses his echo to remind us. Of the prophecies. And so the first one is when in, in the prophet Ezekiel, where he is speaking of the kingdom of Assyria, now you'll remember the Kingdom of Assyria. The Assyrians were the ones who, um, destroyed the, you know, the lost tribes of Israel who scattered the lost tribes of Israel.

They were their 12 tribes originally, just as their 12 disciples that are the nuke. Israel being reconstituted by Jesus. Right? Well, 10 of those tribes were lost and they were lost because the Assyrians conquered Israel and they scattered. The northern actually, uh, conquered the northern kingdom. The northern kingdom consisted of those original.

10 tribes. Uh, the [00:17:00] Southern Kingdom, uh, consisted of Judah and Benjamin. The Southern Kingdom, uh, was dominated by, uh, Judah, the kingdom of the, the tribe of Judah, which gives us the word Jews. But the northern Kingdom, uh, before, before any of that happened, uh, was dominated by these 10 tribes who lived, um, along the fertile plane that was on the road between Egypt.

And, and, uh, the mes Mesopotamia and the Assyrian Kingdom King conquered them and then scattered them and created what we now know as the diaspora throughout Europe and all of that. So he is talking about that, Ezekiel's talking about that, and he makes this illusion and reminds them of what happened to Assyria.

And they were a great kingdom. Assyria was a great kingdom. And they were a great kingdom such that all the birds of air made their nest in its bowels and under its branches of, that's, this is the, the empire of Assyria. All the animals of the field gave birth to their young, and then in its shade and in this empire's shade.

All great [00:18:00] nations lived. And then of course, that, that changed, uh, because the, um, the, uh, uh, kingdom of Assyria. Ultimately, uh, was conquered by, by Egypt and others, and, and, and he reminds me of that saying on its fallen trunk, settled all the birds of the air and among its bowels, lodge, all the wild animals.

So that great tree had been cut down. He, so he reminds them of the fate of Assyria. And then he also in this, with this echo, reminds him of the fate of Babylon. Again, the same reference, uh, this is from the prophet Daniel. Uh, the tree grew great and strong. It's top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.

It's foliage was beautiful, it's fruit abundant, and it provided food for all the animals of the field. Found shade under it. The birds of the air nested in its branches, and from it all living beings were fed. So [00:19:00] in the prophet Daniel, we see in, in the, the same words that Jesus had just said, the birds of the air nested in its branches.

Um, and then, uh, but something happened. Uh, we all know, you know, Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon and, and, uh, Babylon invaded. The Southern Kingdom, and it destroyed the Southern kingdom. It destroyed Jerusalem. And it took, uh, it took, uh, Judah and Benjamin, the true tribes, uh, their leadership into captivity in Babylon for over 70 years.

And, and yet, uh, in, in, in the book of Daniel, there is this prophecy that says it will be cut down. And uh, and something interesting was gonna happen. What's gonna happen is that this resistance that the Israel was receiving, um. Would actually be turned to the good. They amen it for evil, but it'll be turned to the good.

And so the story continues, and by this, uh, how it continues, I want to introduce this third point that along the way of love, you can expect resistance, [00:20:00] but, but that resistance isn't always the end of the story. That that pushback, that resistance. Often is the way you know that you are on the right track.

And so the story continues. So Jesus says, what can we compare the kingdom of God to, but like a mustard seed? And so he evokes this story of, of Babylon, and that story continues. Uh. Uh, he says, thus says the word God. I myself will take up a sprig from the lofty top of a cedar. I will set it out. I will break off a tender one from the top.

Most of its young twigs. I myself will plan it on a high and lofty mountain. The high and lofty mountain was a scriptural illusion. It always was a way of pointing to the city of Jerusalem, the lofty mountain on that mountain height of Israel. Um. I will plant that tree and it will become a noble cedar under every kind of bird will live and in [00:21:00] the shade of its branches will nest winged creatures of every kind.

All the trees of the field shall know that I'm the Lord for I bring low the high tree, I make high the low tree. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. And so the prophe of the prophecy of Ezekiel, this reference to birds, uh, of the air shall nestle in it. Branches evoke this, this prophecy of Ezekiel and of Daniel, uh, both of which spoke about the, the destruction of Israel, the two kingdoms, and, and yet God's promise that there would be a holy remnant.

And this holy remnant would be preserved. And from it, God's dream would carry on and it would be like a mustard seed. And God, God's word would not return empty. He, he has spoken and will accomplish accomplish it. And so what we have is this story. Now I want to talk about this mustard seed for um, a moment.

Uh, if you think about a mustard seed, you know, yesterday, uh. [00:22:00] Uh, some of were out in the yard with me as I planted my vegetable garden for the first time. And as I was getting the soil ready and all that, they went into the woods next to our house and they pulled out and they brought to me a little, um, a little tree.

It was about, hmm, six inches tall, you know, uh, really small thing. And they said, what is this? And I explained to me, yeah, that's a, that, that's some kind of tree. And I tried to name it, I think it's a kind of oak tree or something like that, but you can't tell because it was so small. I couldn't tell. And they said, well, what, what, well, what is it?

I said, well, what's a weed? They cause us to have a conversation. What is a weed? And I said, well, a weed is, is is a plant that's not in the place that you wanted it. It's, it simply is Know things aren't inherently weeds. They are weeds if, if they're not where we want them. What's interesting about this parable is that Jesus says the kingdom of of heaven, the kingdom of God.

Is like a weed. Yeah, because a mustard seed is a very noxious weed. Uh, it spreads, it spreads like a [00:23:00] rhubarb plant. It's, you know, rhubarb. You can make rhubarb pie outta it, boy, you get your garden. It's invasive. And so mustard plants are highly invasive plants and so they were experiencing are experienced like weeds.

And so Jesus says the kingdom of God is like. A weed that's gonna grow so large and ultimately will become this, uh, big bow. This, this thing from which I will build, uh, this place in which all the nations will rest. So think about that. This, this way of love, this kingdom of God that God is creating is like a noxious weed.

Others will find it. No noxious. Others will find it, uh, inhospitable. Others will find it, uh, uh, like a plant that, that they don't want in its location. It's offensive. It doesn't fit their vision for the way the world should be. The way of love, uh, is an unwelcome plant, you know, in the eyes of [00:24:00] many, but yet.

It will become slowly but surely this, this plant that will grow so large, even though you can't see it now, it'll become so large that eventually it will become that place, that final place where all the nations, uh, will, will gather and find rest. The birds of the air shall rest in it. So this is what's happening, my friends.

Jesus is saying to his disciples right now, they see our movement like a mustard seed. They see our movement like a noxious weed. And yet this, this is the fulfillment that, that, uh, that Ezekiel and Daniel foretold of God's movement to bring about justice throughout the lands. Of course, when you're sentenced with death, when you feel like your dreams are shattered, these things are very hard to believe When you [00:25:00] feel like that boulder has fallen upon you so that you can't breathe, these things are hardly hard to to believe.

And yet, Jesus out in that boat, out in that nave where all of the disciples were gathered, reminded them to have faith, faith. Things unseen and brothers and sisters, that's what I believe. We are called to always, but especially now in our land and in our pregnant time as as we are trying to transition to a new kind of society where, where there is truly this justice for all.

Uh, we are called to have faith in things unseen as we experience setbacks in our personal lives. As we, as we feel ourselves, uh, you know, taking things personally as though God has forgotten us. Uh, we are called to have this, to receive this gift of faith. Things unseen. And, and, and I'm, I'm quoting of course, the epistle to the Hebrews where [00:26:00] uh, the author talks about, uh, this, and he says that faith is the reality of what we hope for the proof of what we don't see.

And I want you to think about that. Faith is the reality. It's the gift of our taking the future of our experiencing the future, which is not present and making it present. Faith is our ability to trust in that, so that we expand. It as real. It's not here yet, but yet it's, and faith is our ability to trust in that and then to change our lives and to begin moving in our lives as though that which is God's promise has already happened, has already been inaugurated.

It's it that, that faith itself is the proof. Of what we do, not seed much like that mustard seed. So he begins, uh, so the author goes on to say, by faith we understand that the universe has been created by a word from God, so that the visible came into existence like a mustard [00:27:00] seed from. The invisible. And that's what's happening in our lives now.

So as we, as we see this pushback from Satan, as we see these boulders falling, as we see this resistance to our trying to live according to the way of love, we need to understand it and understand that simply the way it is going to be. So of course, after this, Jesus is gonna get these guys outta the boat and get them back on the paths, uh, proclaiming this word to all.

So we are called to live a life. Of faith in things unseen and so, so in spite of appearances, folks, you are not alone. You are not forsaken. Uh, your life is precious to God. You are God's beloved. That's the first thing I think we hear in these stories. And, and the second thing is, even though your life feels.

As though everything is falling apart as, as though your dreams are being shattered. That is the mirage that is, that is you're looking at the [00:28:00] world and only looking at the snapshot of what's happening here and now, and not looking at the grand vista of what God has done and what God is, will, uh, will be doing and seeing it as things really are.

It's not the truth about you. It's not the truth about our world, the grand scheme of things. God's word will not return empty, God's word will prevail. So if you're gonna speak truth, you need to tell that story and live according to it. And let your, your actions be guided by it. And then finally that this, this, this word that along the way of love, well we should expect pushback 'cause we're inaugurating a new kingdom that's displacing the kingdoms of the, of the powers and the principalities.

And so when we experience that pushback, we should see it as confirmation. That we're on the right track. That we are, we are actively being agents of Easter as we are called to be changing the world as we ourselves are transformed by the remo renewing of our minds. [00:29:00] And that's the good news, brothers and sisters, on this seventh Sunday of Easter.

It, uh, it's wonderful, wonderful news that God is acting now to change the world, to bring about the justice that is God's justice. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
