# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 33

[00:00:00] Good morning folks. Today we, uh, continue with, uh, Mark's account of, uh, Jesus' last week, uh, in, in, in Jerusalem. We know where this one is going, but this week and last week, he's been in the temple. Uh, and, and. Sort of playing King of the Mountain, if you will, with all who might challenge him. Last week, uh, mark shared the stories of, of two groups who opposed Jesus, uh, as they responded to his proclamation of the kingdom of God by challenging Jesus' authority.

You know, why did he, uh, stage that parade from the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem? Why did he, uh, invade the temple with authority as he did? Uh, and as you'll recall. It did not go well for those who challenged Jesus. Um, today we see two more encounters at the temple. As the Jerusalem elite tried to protect [00:01:00] their status quo by discrediting Jesus.

This, this time it's a different set of challengers. Uh, one thing I would add in passing is that today marks a pivot in our story for. After the stories that we recall today, Jesus won't debate challengers at the temple ever again. So let's get into it. So after Jesus dispatched that delegation from the Sanhedrin last week and that odd bedfellow cohort of Pharisees with Odians Mark reports that.

Some Sadducees who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question. So it's round three at the temple for Jesus. Now, this is the only place where Mark uses the word Sadducees. Matthew mentions this group more frequently. In the past, I've used the word party, uh, as in a political party to differentiate between the three largest groups of Jews and [00:02:00] Jesus' time, Pharisees.

Sadducees and the Essenes. Now, I don't, I don't mean to imply that these were like our organized political parties. I'm just simply to trying to use an illustration because, because they were not political parties. Really. A better phrase would be schools of thought. Might, you know, you know, one might, uh, uh, embrace some of the thoughts of San, of Sadducees while being a Pharisee.

So there was a, a fluidity to them. But Sadducees was an identifiable. Theological and legal viewpoint, uh, that we know was found most prominently among the aristocratic families who were in power, the ones who governed Judea. You remember, I've spoken about the oligarchic families who for a couple of centuries, uh, had consolidated all the land in, in, uh, Palestine to, uh, you know, to themselves, not all of it, but most of it, and had ceased power.

Of the temple in all of its, uh, structures, [00:03:00] uh, including the high priest role. And, and, and because of that, they controlled, uh, the, uh, economic and political authority, uh, within the region. So they were the ones in power, you know, and, and sad see and views were held by most of this group. We know, um, most of the priestly families had this view and, and therefore.

This was the view that dominated the Sanhedrin and we'll recall, it's the Sanhedrin is that, is, was the, the body that would ultimately turn Jesus over, uh, to Pilate. So by, by an analogy today, we might say that someone who holds libertarian or progressive or conservative views on particular questions of public policy, uh, well those would be.

An analogous to thes the sadian views that we're going to encounter today. So we have this sad, these Sadducees who come up, they've seen what's happened with the Pharisees, they've seen what's happened, uh, with the, uh, the, the [00:04:00] Herodians and the, and the other members of the, the, um. Sanhedrin, uh, but now they come to see what they can do because the status quo is being threatened by this revolutionary, this one that appears to be revolutionary, who's, uh, got this massive following, uh, within Galilee and now already within Jerusalem.

Now the Sadducees were conservatives, both politically and theologically. They regarded, uh, mark tells us, um, the, um.

They regarded the resurrection as a very dangerous new idea. They didn't believe in the resurrection for Sadducees. If you can't place your base, your claim on the first five books of the Bible, the Pento, the first five books of Moses, well then it has no credence, no authority. They denied, for example, and, and, uh, this was their strongest, uh.

Debate with the Pharisees. They [00:05:00] denied that, uh, there was any afterlife because it wasn't taught in Genesis or, uh, in the books between Genesis and Deuteronomy. And so they rejected that idea and as far as they could see, the idea of the resurrection depended on a very late into them dubious set of books, uh, in writing books like Daniel.

And, uh, and it, and it depended upon the speculations of groups like the Pharisees, but in their view. Shield was the final resting place, and that's it. And any continuity that a person has after death has to do with the reputation that they generated and, and with their posterity, their descendants. And so when they die, they said, it's game over.

You no longer exist, and there's no relationship with God or any others that actually survives that. Now if you think about it, you can imagine how that view. Is self-serving. If you are among belief in any generation. Collaborating with [00:06:00] the occupying forces of Greece in Rome, uh, was, you know, that was what the Ians did.

And so any sort of view that would support, um, taking on in a, in a militant way, uh, you know, the ones with whom they collaborated with, they weren't going to support. Uh, and, and so their, their point was there is no point in martyrdom. For the sake of liberating the people or, uh, obtaining a more just distribution of wealth in the land.

Because if you die to serve others, you're a fool because your existence is wiped out when you die. Moreover, the resurrection was a very politically risky idea. It became popular. You recall during the revolutionary movements that we, we've talked about in the last couple of weeks, particularly the Maccabean, you know, the, the story surrounding Daniel and the, and the, the, the, uh, uh, getting the temple control of the temple back from the Greeks.

Right. And so resurrection arose as an idea then, uh, and it affirms [00:07:00] that the martyrs, the Maccabean martyrs had a glorious future awaiting them in the eventual resurrection when they would be given, uh. New bodies, so people who believe God is going to recreate the whole world and including Israel are much more likely to do daring and risky things.

Well, wealthy elites who already rule prefer not to embrace ideas that might upset their privileged position in the status quo. So you can see why the aristocratic, priestly families who held these sadian views would be concerned about Jesus after all he was saying and doing things that announced the arrival of this new kingdom of God.

And so. We understand as they approached him, what they wanted to do was determine if Jesus was a threat. Was he on the same side as that most militant set of revolutionary Pharisees? Was he a threat to their [00:08:00] privileged place in Judea? So we have this debate. They approach Jesus with this crazy story involving a Jewish law that you find in Deuteronomy 25, about verse five.

It begins, they intend their question about what's known as lever, uh, liberate ma marriage to reveal that the idea of an afterlife is ridiculous. That's what's supposed to happen as they approach Jesus. Well, Jesus responds first in particular to their crazy hypothetical based on the law. Concerning leverate marriage.

Then he responds to their confusion about the afterlife. I want to flip what Jesus did and look at Jesus' two points in reverse order. I think, I think for me it's easy to understand that way 'cause Jesus, uh, recognized the fallacy in the duy and school of thought that, uh, the sad and school of thought is not merely some ancient way of seeing the world.

That [00:09:00] is irrelevant in our time. Duce and logic is something that I wanna make sure you understand is very much alive, even though the Sadducees grouped themselves, you know, died out after the temple was destroyed. Duce and logic is very much alive in our political debates today. We see it. Most obviously in our political tensions concerning the vocational possibilities of persons who are not white, heterosexual males.

Uh, those seeking to sustain the power of white male heterosexuals to dominate decision making at the family, community, and national levels. Often ground our arguments in often unstated premises about the nature of God in creation. If you ask us how we know what we know about these things, they in, we inevitably point back to the first few books of the Bible.

[00:10:00] And we claim and we ground our claims in accounts of creation in which we see the male patriarchy emerging from eating. I know this because you guys may remember, I wrote a, a theology, uh, of marriage, uh, as we decided to understand as the Episcopal church marriage in a new way. And the arguments, uh, that were made against, uh, what I wrote.

We're all grounded in these stories that the sadian pointed to as well, uh, and, and almost all orthodoxies that I have encountered in my life, whether they are from the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican or the Orthodox churches, or from current conservative evangelical churches. What I have seen is this Sadian School of Thought at the heart of their preference for a male led world.

That marginalizes, non heterosexuals. And the basic logic is this, God created the world and the way we see it and the creation stories of the Bible, and that's the way it [00:11:00] is. That's the way it'll always be. And there is no authority for ways of being that we can't ground in our traditional interpretations and our traditional interpretations of those first few books of the Bible.

And so we see the Sian School of Thought in our lives today whenever we encounter a political claim for how we should order or how we should not reorder our society based upon what I call a static view of God in creation. That's the premise that's underlying this. And that's the premise that Jesus attacks.

And the way he gets at it is by just going back to what, what something in the first five books of Moses, something that the Sadducees should have, uh, accepted. So Jesus rejects this static view of the world. Jesus rejects this static view of creation. He rejects this duy and school of thought. He points to a passage right at the heart of Torah.

From the Book of Exodus, one of the books that the [00:12:00] Duan acknowledged as authoritative. It's the story of Moses and the burning bush, the one that Tom read to us so beautifully. And it's a book, it's a story in which God meets Moses on holy ground. God introduces God's self as Abraham's God, as Isaac's God, and as Jacob's God.

And Jesus argues it that that, uh. That if, if that's how God chooses to reveal God's self, then it cannot be that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are dead, no longer exist and will never exist again. In other words, Jesus points to the name that God gave him himself. I am. And he and, and Jesus derives from it an understanding of God's very nature.

I am means that God was, is and will always be in a relationship with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. [00:13:00] That relationship did not end when they died. That relationship is ongoing of a different nature, even though they died. To be clear, Jesus is not merely saying that they are alive in the presence of God and that this phase of their afterlife is what we denote as.

Resurrection. Now, on the contrary, everybody knew that the patriarchs died and had not been raised from the dead. The point is that they now, right now rest in peace with God and all the dead with my father and my mother and yours perhaps, but that God who desires to be known as their God. Must intend to raise them from death in the future.

That's Jesus's basic reasoning.

So from the burning bush, Jesus gets to something. Uh, one of my favorite Theo theologians, Carl Bart, uh, described, [00:14:00] uh, as God's self, a revelation of God's essence. God telling us, uh, who God is, as Carl Bart put it, God is the one who in the divine self establishing, chose to be known as the God who is never to be except to be.

With us. That's what Jesus is saying. This is God's nature. And by reflecting on that, Jesus helps us to see that God and creation are not static at all in the way folks espousing sad. You see in thoughts would have us believe. On the contrary, Jesus says, my essence, that the very heart of my being. I am creative that that's what the phrase I am.

That's what God's name means. God is constantly creating and recreating, making the world new, giving us new beginnings precisely because God's nature is never to abandon us, and it's when we recognize that essential nature of God, that we understand that [00:15:00] resurrection is part of God's plan to carry on with us.

In relationship with God eternally.

Now I unpacked this at length on Easter Sunday, so I encourage you to listen to the Easter Sermon podcast for more detail on this. I just wanna remind you of a couple of points that that, that Jesus is alluding to here. The key point is to remember something that Paul taught us, that death is part of God's solution.

It's part of God's solution to our problem of sin. Sin I said then is like a virus. It's like a virus of ignorance, of pandemic proportions. Sin expressed our ignorance of how to be fully human, uh, by loving all created things as God loves them. That infection. Must be contained. That's our sin must be contained.

If we carry [00:16:00] forward with us the virus of sin infecting all the world, well, uh, well, we cannot be allowed to live indefinitely. So death is God's judgment on our sin. God refuses to give our sin a future because our sin is unworthy of that future. Our sin is unworthy of life. Eternal.

But death turns out it's only a partial solution to our sin for death. Eradicates the good, along with the evil we create So, so death is a partial solution to our sin because there's no continuity of our goodness. If death is the whole solution to the problem of sin. And so that's where resurrection comes in.

Resurrection is a reversal of death. It's God undoing death. Uh, and, and, and that then Death [00:17:00] Plus Resurrection becomes God's full solution to our sin. Precisely because God's essence is to be your God always. God's solution to sin makes a way through the wilderness to the new Jerusalem for you.

Resurrections, in other words, is not, uh, resurrection is not just a, a nicer way of, of being dead. It's not just a, a, a, a, you know, the way we are now continuing, it's the reversal of death, the gift of a new body. We inhabit as citizens of the new Jerusalem, the body in which you and I will enjoy life in the new world that God is creating.

That's what resurrection is. We often get confused about that, that that's why Jesus rebukes the jees in school of thought and rebukes all the ways that we justify our privileged positions based on them. So harshly, Yahweh, he says, is [00:18:00] not the God of the dead, but of the living. And if you don't trust in the pro promise of the resurrection, then you don't get who God is.

You don't get the essence of God's character that God's name reveals. And so Jesus says very clearly, if that's what you think is true, then you are seriously mistaken. I. So that background I think is essential for us to make any sense of Jesus's first point, which is that we won't find all of our current ways of being when we arrive at the new Jerusalem, precisely because some.

Don't have any place, there won't have any place there. Death, after all, is God's solution to the problem of our sin, death, eradicates, the evil that we do. So God who values God's creation, us and all the good that we, we do so highly is remaking us, remaking the creation and, and, and the our symbol for that new [00:19:00] creation.

The new Jerusalem that we read about in most particularly in the Book of Revelation of John. And at that, and there we read that God will wipe away every tear from our eyes. Death will be no more. There'll be no more mourning, crying, or pain anymore. For the former things will have passed away. Folks, many people, especially those of us who enjoy a privileged position today in society because our destiny was to be born into the groups in power.

Imagine that resurrection really is nothing more than the continuation of this life. Only with a new battery installed so that we won't run out of fuel and we can live forever. Uh, that was the dutty and mistake in our culture. People often think of heaven in that way, but that's not what the Bible teaches about the resurrection at all.

That's not what heaven is at all. The resurrection [00:20:00] is not merely resuscitation. If you think that as the Sadducees evidently thought, then Jesus has a word for you today. The resurrection is not your current life continuing forever. That would be hell for so many in heaven, only for those of us who are in privilege.

No, the resurrection is about God recreating all things new, a new bodied existence eternally with God, and the world symbolized by the new Jerusalem. And in that world, there's no place for the institutions that we created after the fall as part of our sinful habit of exploiting one another. The resurrection, in other words, is it preci, opposes, transformed humanity.

So in response to their crazy hypothetical about a woman married to seven brothers, Jesus explains that the practice of leverate marriage that they described is one of [00:21:00] those things that will wither away like the grass. Why? Because it's rooted in sin. The scenario that the Sadducees posed to Jesus is based on some archaic law arising from due to de Tonomy 25, uh, that's called ate marriage.

Now, interestingly enough, if you look in Leviticus, it says that, you know, the brother cannot marry his, his brother's wife. Uh, uh. So what we have here is, is an exception in Deuteronomy, and, and so they pose a hypothetical in which a woman's husband dies leaving her without a son. Therefore leaving her without any political identity, without any title to land, any form of sustenance.

Since political identity and economic reality only passed, economic power only passed through the mail in Jewish law and in most ancient law in much of our law, frankly, based on an exception in the law that [00:22:00] covered that situation. In, in their scenario, she married all six brothers. She survived them all and yet each one left her sunless no air.

What's interesting to me that I hope that you'll notice is that what the Sadducees don't do, they don't express sympathy for the woman who would've experienced profound shame in her culture for her barrenness. As you will recall, Abraham's wife, Rachel did, and as Hannah did in the first uh, book of Samuel, no, no.

Their concern is not at all for the woman I. For the men, they ask Jesus in the afterlife, to which of the men will she belong? That's what's actually the phrase, the, the, the grammar there. The woman is an object to them to be possessed, to be owned. To whom will she belong? To whom will she be given? The relevant question for them is about who owns her?

They, and they, the other also, [00:23:00] they, they, they leave out a crucial clause that you find in Deuteronomy 25 that helps us understand why Jesus batted away their hypothetical as a gross conceptual era. The clause they leave out is if brothers live together and one of them dies without having a son. In other words, the law only applies to brothers who resided together.

Now, historically. The rabbis understood, re, re residing together to mean they owned contiguous land. And so, uh, the, the levered marriage actually was a law created for a purpose, an unholy purpose. The purpose of maintaining land ownership with the, within the family, and ensuring that the economic and political benefits of land ownership remained within the family.

That's why it arose. As a byproduct of sustaining the patriarchy, it also addressed a tragic reality for women that patriarchal systems historically create. The widow is thrown off the land and allowed to [00:24:00] starve. She's in, uh, she, she, she had enjoyed that land with her husband, uh, but she's thrown off the land by her son and daughter-in-law so that they might enjoy it in her place, and she's left.

To glean the fields. So Leverate marriage was intended to protect such women, such childless women from such faiths. But the only reason such a law was needed was because patriarchal systems do something God never did. They turn women into chattel property. They make women less than, they reduce women to objects completely dependent on the whims of.

Us males who have the power to exploit them or love them, we can do either. And too often we do the, the former and the law. In other words, like divorce was a product of the fall, and that's how Jesus sees it. That's how Jesus responds to it. It's no surprise that the Sadducees would want laws that assure.

Land remains within the family after death. Given that the oligarchic families ruling Judea sustained their power precisely [00:25:00] through that method, consolidating the lands of the many into their privileged hands. In fact, that's their presumption. That's the presumption underlying their question. They assume that the afterlife that they denied, but that was imagined by the Pharisees and Essenes would carry on the institutions they knew and cherished.

Such as the patriarchy, leverate marriage was all about patriarchy. Its whole purpose preci opposed the existence of the patriarchy and the desirability of its continuation. Women had no political identity or means of survival apart from subordination to men. The law Jesus said was only necessary because in contrast with Adam and Eve, the culture that evolved after the fall, uh, was one in which male domination and family and community was a given.

And we already know what Jesus had to say about that 'cause we unpack that when we talked about divorce. And I urge you to go back to September 12th. A sermon podcast to [00:26:00] listen to that podcast for the details of Jesus' teaching on divorce. The bottom line is that Jesus saw the patriarchy not at all as a given, but as a tragic law that arose from male sin.

So that's surely why Jesus responded to the Sadducees. Hypothetical in the way he did. Isn't this the reason you're wrong? Because you don't either know the scriptures or God's power. When people arise from the dead, they won't marry, nor will they be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like God's angels.

And how will we be like God's angels? Well, folks, at the fulfillment of time, scripture tells us that we will at last be like the angels and that we will have learned to do what they do by their very nature Angels, by nature will what God wills and express only the truth that God is. We humans are different than angels.

We are both finite. [00:27:00] Free. And as a result of our finitude and our freedom, we will what we will and are free to do other than what God wills and often do. But in the new Jerusalem, at the fulfillment of time, when we have matured like a a, a fruit on the vine, God will have completed the reconciliation of all creation to God's self and transformed us.

The renewing of our minds. And at that point we will, will what God wills and we will experience grace and the giving of grace as God's command. We will love each other rightly and like the angels, we will sing hallelujahs and praise the Lord. As we see in the revelation to John, we, we will carry forward only the good.

And, and we will will only the good. And for that reason, the patriarchal institution of marriage, which gives a woman to man as possession won't be necessary in order to assure [00:28:00] a woman's security. And I think that's why Jesus says to the Sadducees, this is your error. You neither knew scripture nor God's power.

So having dispatched the Sadducees, Jesus barely has time to sit back. Before, uh, he, he sees a scribe approaching him who's been listening on the side, uh, listening to him respond to all those who had come and come to test him. Now, given that Jesus had very little good to say, two are about scribes. As we were really gonna see next week, it's notable that Mark closes his account of Jesus's, uh, engagement of his opponents at the Temple by recalling what Mark reports as a relatively positive encounter with a solitary scribe, uh, Matthew and Luke.

I. Tell the story in a little bit different way than this. Um, the scribe asked [00:29:00] Jesus, the scribe, by the way, was a legal expert. He asked Jesus a question that we know from writings that are available from the time was commonly debated, uh, excuse me, commonly debated, uh, by the, the Jewish legal experts.

Which of the more than 600 laws that one finds in Torah is the most important.

Jesus reply, um, it turns out echoes one that would've been well known to describe, well-known to the people of Jesus' generation. He, he echoed a famous request that was made to one of the greatest of all Jewish rabbis, or actually two of them, uh, rabbi Shamai and Hillel, um, uh, in which the, the, the person asked.

Teach me the whole of Torah while I am standing on one leg. Teach me the whole Torah while I am standing on one leg. And Rabbi Hillel replied, do not do to your neighbor what is hateful to you. [00:30:00] This is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary. So Jesus' reply, uh, wouldn't have been surprising. I think the astonishing thing is that when the scribe agrees with them, Jesus didn't invite him to join the Fellowship of Disciples, as we've seen before.

Rather, Jesus says, the scribe is not in the kingdom of God, but as close to the reign of God. In other words, a scribe. Gets it intellectually, I think, but Jesus evidently felt that getting it intellectually is not enough. Knowing the commandments that themselves will fulfill the law and the prophets is something to be commended, and Jesus commends the scribe, but Jesus actually expects us to do them, and he also expects us to be able to do them.

You might think it's impossible for you to love your neighbor as yourself. That's not what Jesus thinks. And I think, uh, it's important for us to remember Jesus [00:31:00] speaks about the, the law by beginning with worship. Torah begins with worship. Our beings were created to like the angels adore God. We are to love God with.

All of ourselves because we are made in God's image. We become fully human. We become our true selves. If you're looking for yourself, this is where you look. You know you become your true self when you learn to love and worship the one we are designed to reflect. God teaches us to pour out every fiber of our being gladly in worship of our creator, sustainer, and redeemer.

Whenever we do that, whatever we are to do, we are to do for God. And if we truly live like that, even for a moment, well then we become like the angels in those moments. And at those moments, God [00:32:00] reigns in our hearts on earth, just as in heaven. And the amazing thing is that Jesus thinks such loving and living with God is within reach for us.

That's true for the second commandment. He mentions too loving our neighbors as ourselves. Now he's not talking about some sappy, uh, tolerance of our neighbor. No, he's talking about deep servant leadership types of friendship with those who may not be part of our own tribe. The I've got your back kind of commitment.

We give and hope to receive ourselves in our deepest human relationships. Jesus seems to believe that it's now possible for us to actually do that, to love our neighbors as ourselves, because Jesus is making that possible through the forgiveness of our sins. He's making it possible by teaching us the way he's teaching us, showing us with [00:33:00] his own life how to love that way.

And when we do that, Jesus says, the central purpose of poah and the promises spoken through the prophets are fulfilled. The.

We ought to remember that the reason Marx writing his disciples is that Jewish Christians in Rome and and in Palestine are under threat. They understand that the. The temple, uh, that they, they understand is the central place where they worship God is about to be destroyed by Roman legions. And Mark remembers this story about Jesus, I think in a very pastoral way.

Uh, if these commandments. Are the most important ones. If loving one's neighbor is in fact how we love God with all our heart, mind, and soul. If deep in abiding friendships in which we become the beliefs so [00:34:00] that, uh, others might flourish in which we serve one another, as Jesus teaches us if, well, if those things are what worshiping, loving, and serving God is actually all about.

Well, then all that, the temple stands for those daily, weekly, and annual rounds of sacrifices and offerings. Well then it's no longer necessary. Loving God in one's neighbor is what matters. The Jerusalem temple and its sacrifices don't, and we ourselves, we who choose to follow Jesus on the way of love, become.

The body of Christ. And as Paul will say later in a letter to Corinth, uh, our own bodies become part of the temple of the Holy Spirit. So we don't need buildings, we don't need rituals to worship God. And so we have no reason to be threatened when things that have been sacred to us, sacred places for us will no longer [00:35:00] be part of our lives.

When we walk the way of love, as Jesus teaches, eventually our minds will be transformed, such that our very, uh, lives become lives of worship. Every step we take is worship, and every touch we make loving our neighbor as we earn to be loved is part of our. Our, uh, instinctive response to God's love for us.

And when we do that, we fulfill the law and the prophets by having holy friendships with God and each other, the way of love as Jesus taught us. So when the temple falls, when the, when crises knock us down, knock you down, when our foundations are shaken, when our. Path forward seems, uh, shaky. Well, our path forward is actually clear.

Love God, love our neighbor. That's all we need to do. [00:36:00] That's all we need to know. Everything else is commentary. And so Jesus ended his round of debates with his challenges and he emerged. I think Mark is wanting us to know the clear victor, having bound up the strong man. And I, I love it. Uh, uh, we fulfilled the law and the prophets by having holy friendships with God in each other.

Uh. Um, and we discovered that, uh, after, after having vanquished his opponents, Jesus uh, uh, is able to move on with his, his, uh, mission in the temple for after that no one dared ask. Brothers and sisters, my prayer for you is that this week God will give you a special capacity to love your neighbor as yourself so that you do your part in bringing about the new [00:37:00] Jerusalem.

That is, is our Reem embodied new beginning, uh, as we learn to love each other in that way. God is recreating us in making that time, that fulfillment of time. One step closer. May that be, uh, what you experienced this week in the name of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen.
