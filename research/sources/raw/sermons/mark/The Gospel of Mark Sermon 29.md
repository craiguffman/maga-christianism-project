# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 29

[00:00:00] Good morning, brothers and sisters. Uh, I'm excited, uh, today about our lesson. Uh, we have reached, uh, a major milestone in our, in our efforts to work through, uh, a close reading of the Gospel of Mark ever since we began, uh. In March, I've been telling you that it's, uh, you know, our, our goal will be to read this gospel literarily to, to see Mark as the artist that he is and thereby to understand what he's trying to communicate.

And today, we reach, uh, a major, uh, point in his literary effort because, uh, this gospel lesson today, uh, brings us, uh, to, uh, a, a new, uh, a new. Part of the story. After today, Jesus will have, have finally, uh, reached Jerusalem and we'll, we'll begin to see the passion story unfold. And so we, we've been [00:01:00] walking through this story today, and today we see I.

I've been telling you that it, it's, it's, uh, fascinating when we step back and see what Mark as an artist is doing and try in order to try to, uh, to, in order to convey to us, uh, the meaning of this life that he witnessed. And, uh, today I think you really see that artistry well. So that's what we'll be going through.

I'm really excited. But before we get into that, I wanna remind you 'cause I think it's essential for understanding today. Of what we spoke about last week, because last week we saw that Jesus and the disciples, and now many, many followers who were, uh, outside of the, the group that called themselves disciples, um, were, they were on this journey from the most northeastern tip of the Roman province called Palestine, and, and already in route to Jerusalem.

And during this time, Jesus has been. Teaching, he's been doing catechesis, uh, teaching the disciples, preparing them for what will follow, and, uh, preparing them by imparting wisdom [00:02:00] that they will need, uh, in order to carry on his work. Uh, we know that retrospectively, but what happened last week was, uh. As, as, uh, they were, uh, on their journey, a wealthy man came up to them.

And this is where we had that, uh, very famous saying, where, where Jesus borrows a, a, a very famous, uh, very commonly used Middle Eastern proverb, where it says, it's harder for it's impo. You know, it's, it's harder for a, a, an elephant to get through a needle than whatever it is that you're wanting to convey as being impossible.

And, and in, in, in the, in the Palestinian. Version of that, it's harder for the largest animal known to them to get through an eye of a needle, which is of course a camel, the Drummond dairy, and Jesus in those words, saying, making the point as he encountered this rich man who wanted to be a disciple, who, uh, found it too difficult to, to, to follow the way because he'd have to.

Jesus told him that he'd need to give up all his possessions. Uh, [00:03:00] Jesus gives us this saying, making the point that it's impossible for a wealthy person to enter. The dominion of God. In other words, to have their hearts be reign, you know, have, have God reigning in them and thereby to have this intimate personal relationship in which they will, what God will.

Since we, we unpack that a little bit, and I encourage you to listen to, uh, the, the sermon from last week, uh, on the podcast, uh, for, for, for that information because I think it's essential today. To what Mark, uh, you know, does in our stories, but once you, the, the key point of that, that I would like for you to remember is that Jesus calls us by name and he looks into our hearts, and he names the things that are our, are our ice, our that are our obstacles to that full and rich relationship with God.

That is life itself. He, he is calling us into life and in this case, he named. That wealth, those possessions, uh, [00:04:00] as the man's obstacle. And what we saw was, uh, the, the obstacle for the man was his blindness. In other words, his, his inability to see his possessions for what they were. And, and I made the point that, uh, that, uh, welcoming.

The dominion of God. Welcoming God's reign in our hearts and mind means being liberated so that we learn over a lifetime to see all of our possessions as gifts that we are meant to steward and not as measures of our own. Um, holiness are as, uh, as, as, uh, uh, ways that we achieve relationship with God.

They are a means of grace, not the end of grace. Very important backdrop to our story today. So today we continue with this, what I'm calling this catechetical journey as Jesus is going to Jerusalem. I, uh, I, I. I wanna make sure we don't bypass what I think is a very little interesting detail [00:05:00] along the way where Jesus, where Mark tells us that the disciples were amazed.

Uh, so, so Jesus has told them twice already that he's going to Jerusalem and what's gonna happen in Jerusalem, that he is going to be arrested, cried, and crucified. And, and, and so he's told them, I'm gonna go to Jerusalem. And when I go to Jerusalem. They're gonna kill me. And, and so I love this, the, the introduction of our text today where, where Mark tells us that Jesus estas were on their way and Jesus was in the lead.

So I had this vision of this guy just walking, you know, at a very rapid pace, up the hill, up the, toward the Holy Mountain in Jerusalem, uh, leading them. And it says that, uh, the disciples were amazed in many way. In, in meanwhile, the, the, the other followers, uh, who stayed behind. They weren't amazed, they were afraid what's going to happen here.

So it's a great drama that, that, that mark sets up here. I just wanna make sure you as an aside, don't miss, miss that. [00:06:00] But what happens in our text today is we see Mark recalling the third passion prediction the third. Prediction of what's going to happen, uh, to Jesus when he gets there. And they have the same elements in that story that, uh, we've seen before, but, but, uh, in much more detail.

And in fact, you could take these sentences here. Uh, they're gonna go to Jerusalem. Jesus will be handed over to the chief priest and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and they'll hand him over to the Romans for execution, and then those people will ridicule you, him spit, ridicule him, spit on him, torture him, and kill him.

Well, that's, that's pretty much the plot that we're going to see, uh, going forward once they get into Jerusalem and our next couple of weeks. And of course after three days, he will rise up. Uh, something that would've been and was inscrutable, uh, for the disciples to understand at that point when they heard it the first time.

But Jesus does something new here in this third prediction of his [00:07:00] passion narrative. He doesn't, uh, he doesn't just tell them what's gonna happen. He for the first time tells them why it's going to happen. And this is very important to our story. Uh, I think first of all, it's, it is important to us, uh, not the least because we're, you know, we are the ones who often ask, well, why did Jesus have to die?

And, and I, I urge you if, if you want to drill into that question in a deep way. Uh, go back and on the podcast and listen to the Easter, uh, sermon there, where that's our topic. Why did Jesus have to die? But Mark gives us another dimension on that, a, a, a different take on that that's very common, commonly, uh, uh, understood by us today.

Uh, and it has to do with Jesus naming how Jesus saw himself and his role as the Messiah. And, and one of the things that's important for us is to remember that there was no monolithic understanding of who the Messiah would be, uh, in the literature of the [00:08:00] time in, in the, in the centuries before. There was a great diversity of opinions of what.

The Messiah would be like, but the dominant one was that of King David. And I say King, uh, you know, advisedly the word king. Imagine, you know, our own George Washington on his white steed with his sword at his belt and the military behind him. You know, that's, that's who King David was. He was the royal one who.

Corrected all the wrongs and United Israel and protected them. And, and the, the dominant expectation of the Messiah would be that, was that he, that the Messiah would do something like that. And so in context, he would be some kind of militaristic leader who would somehow throw off the yoke of the Romans.

But Jesus doesn't understand his own role that way. He invokes the, a motif that comes from the, what I call the gospel of Isaiah, and he, he tells us what the, that meaning of his [00:09:00] death will be. He says that the human one and the human one, you remember, is a, is a, is a symbol that we get from the book of Daniel.

Um, didn't come to be, to be served, but rather to serve. And here's the important point I wanna draw attention to right now. Uh, to give his life to liberate many people. In other words, Jesus's suffering has a purpose. I wanna make sure. We notice that this is something I've shared with you before, uh, is, is unique to, uh, the, the Christian understanding of how God functions we, uh, are distinctive in our insistence that our suffering can have a purpose.

That, that in contradistinction from the, um, the um. Oh, uh, the, the Hindu and other Eastern religions, uh, we don't hold that. Suffering is to be avoided. That suffering is something that we [00:10:00] just sort of go through in life, but it'll get better when we, when we leave this life, we say that suffering in our life, God actually acts through that.

And this is what we see Jesus saying here. And his particular purpose, he says, is to free. The people. Uh, and, and in the, the, the new revised standard version, it has the same thing the translation talks about he will give his life as a ransom for many. And this, this word ransom is actually a literal translation of the Greek, uh, in, in the sense of giving something so that.

The captive is released. Um, this comes from the prophet Isaiah in chapter 52. So I wanna give you a bit of history. So you put this in context. The prophet Isaiah spanned his, his scroll spanned 250 years, but this portion here in, in chapter 53, uh, comes from a time when, when, uh, the, the Jews were in captivity in.

Um, Babylon, they're in exile and they're, and they're re, they're writing down the scriptures that [00:11:00] we know as the Old Testament for the very first time, and they're asking themselves, how did this happen to us? How is it that this life that I'm leading now happened to me? You know, why? Why has God turned God's face from me?

Why has God abandoned me, uh, uh, you know, abandoned us as a people so that we find ourselves? Our, our our, uh, our old, our past burned to, to the ground you of Jerusalem had been burned to the ground and we are now prisoners and slaves in Babylon. And they, they wrote, uh, all the books. They, they've redacted all the books that we know now is the Old Testament.

But, but the prophet Isaiah talked about this in this Oracle, this person that, that, that we, uh, theologians called the suffering servant. And he said to the people, God said to the people, uh, through Isaiah. That God was going to rescue them, that they, he would build a way for, for them through the wilderness, and that the one who would lead them would be this person that he would [00:12:00] rise up.

And this is where we have this phrase that you're familiar with from Christmas or from Advent. But this suffering servant was wounded for our transgressions. You, you know it, say it with me if you can. Crushed for our inequities upon him was the punishment that made us whole. And by his bruises, we are healed And.

We, like sheep have gone astray. We've all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the inequity of us all. So what we see is this suffering servant, uh, who has absorbed and taken all of our sin upon himself and offered himself sacrificially as the lamb to be sacrificed for our atonement, our atonement.

The word atonement means to be made as one to be. Reconciled. And so for the purpose of bringing us together, this suffering servant would give himself, um, so that we might be at one with God, we would be atone with God the Day of [00:13:00] Atonement, uh, on the cross for us. And, uh, and, and so Isaiah goes on to say, when you, that's the Yahweh, make his life an offering for sin.

He shall see his offspring, that's us, and shall prolong his days Through him, the will of the Lord will prosper. And so that is the will of the Lord according to the prophet Isaiah, that the suffering servant will. Will, uh, suffer, uh, so that we might be brought out of our exile and out of his anguish, he shall see the light.

And he, and, uh, and it talks about again, my servant shall make many righteous, make us righteous, and he shall bear their inequity. So again and again, you see this suffering service servant, uh, understanding the Messiah. That was a minority report, if you will, among the rabbinic. Uh, thinking about what the Messiah would be like.

Jesus. Now, in, in what Mark is recalling, is saying, this is how Jesus understood [00:14:00] what he was doing. He was going to Jerusalem. He was leading this disciples at a very fast flip, such that they were amazed 'cause he understood his job was to go liberate God's people through being that suffering servant for us.

So that's Jesus' self understanding of his mission. What's interesting is it was, it wasn't the way his own disciples understood it, his own disciples repeatedly in the gospel of Mark, don't quite get it. So on this catechetical journey where Jesus has been schooling them so that they learn to see the world the way Jesus sees it, they keep.

Being the ones who never quite get it. And we see others who will pop up, who are not among the disciples, who will see Jesus and name him who he really is, and they will get this liberating, redeeming, uh uh. Understanding of the Messiah. Instantly, intuitively. And his disciples will be the one, [00:15:00] the ones who don't quite get it.

And that's what we see immediately following, uh, Jesus' passion, um, narrative. 'cause the, the ones that, uh, just, just the last week I. Uh, we're, we're, we're asking, well, you know, arguing about, uh, you know, who among us, you know, you know, will, will be the greatest in the kingdom. Well, two of them, the, the two brothers, James and John come to Jesus and, uh, and ask for something quite extraordinary.

Now, I want you to imagine, uh. You know, um, someone coming up to you and, and asking what they ask. Uh, I was thinking, um, if, if my nephew, uh, were to go up to, to his, his dad or his mom and brothers or Asha and, and say, Hey, mom and dad, I wanna ask you something. I want you to agree in advance before I tell you what it is that you'll do for me.

Whatever you want, whatever I'm gonna ask you. You know, you would go, woo, you know, you'd back off. And that's, uh, quite a, an aggressive posture. Um. And, uh, and that's what, uh, these folks who have been following Jesus, who ought to have [00:16:00] known better, did, uh, James and John, the two brothers. 'cause they say, he, he, Jesus responds to them.

I want you to remember this. This is what he ask. He says, what do you want me to do for you? That's the question you'll see that Jesus asks us, what do you want for me to do for you? And notice what they ask. Allow one of us to sit on your right and the other on your left when you enter into your glory.

So you and I, I wanna make sure we hear this because when we hear enter into your glory, well, for us, that doesn't seem an odd question so much in a sense of entering into your glory, because we are the ones who live on the other side of the resurrection of Jesus who do use the language and we speak of his glory, his visibility, how he is visible to us, which is what?

The word glory means, you know, to glorify someone is to make them visible. And so, you know, Jesus being supremely visible to the world, you know, we are to glorify Jesus, right? Uh, and so they, it was to, to to, to, uh, speak of Jesus' glorious, to speak of his [00:17:00] triumph. Uh, and uh, of course. We understand that on our side of the resurrection, but this is before that.

And so what we see here is that James and John and the other disciples are anticipating that this march to Jerusalem is going to be like the common understanding of the Messiah, that somehow like King David. Jesus was going to liberate people from the yoke of Rome. Uh, uh, and uh, and so they have this militaristic thing, uh, in their minds is modeled in their minds of what's about to happen.

Somehow, uh, king David was rising again and was gonna liberate, uh, Israel, and so therefore he would have the glory of a king. And so they're saying, Hey, after the battle. Honor us because we're your, you are your top lieutenants, right? I mean, that's basically what they're saying. They're trying to set up what their role will be after the, after the battle is done, and Jesus replies.

[00:18:00] You don't know what you're asking. And he, and then he, and then he asks a question that, again, that, that we can understand today because we practiced the Eucharist, but it's understanding the way that it would've been, you know, before all of that had happened. Can you drink the cup? I drink. You know, scholars understand that the cup, you know, take this cup away from me.

Jesus in Gethsemane, prays, you know, this cup of, of, uh, self humiliation, this cup of, of that, that carries with it the sting of death. This poison that, take this away from me, take this cup, that that will be filled with my blood away from me. This, and, and, and so. So they're saying, can you drink that cup?

Can you receive the baptism I received? Now, one of the things when I think of this, can you receive the baptism that Jesus asks? I'm reminded of going to Canterbury. When I was a Canterbury scholar. I took a trip out to Brittany, which is on the coast of England. That's, uh, [00:19:00] across the channel. You can see France.

And uh, there you can see the, when the. When the Romans, uh, came to England, uh, and established, uh, their, the first, uh, presence there, right on those shores, uh, they established, uh, churches. And one, one of the things that's preserved there is an old, uh, b one of the oldest baptismal fonts that we've ever found.

And, and what we've learned about the baptismal fonts of the early church, and they, they would've already been existing about the time mark's writing, uh, was that they were always carved in rock. So most, many of us were baptized by sprinkling. Some of us may have been baptized by immersion. Some of us were, were, Bab would've been baptized by being doused, but originally.

Uh, they, they had intricate baptismal fonts that, uh, you would walk into, if you can imagine a jacuzzi. They're about that size, but they were always, well, not always, but usually carved out of rock into the shape of a uterus. [00:20:00] A uterus, you know, the, the, the place in which we. Are given new life, right? So symbolically, uh, a a whole, you know, grabbing onto the mo the metaphor, the feminine metaphor that gives us life.

We step into this wound, into the water, and then we submerge ourselves below the waters of chaos, signifying our death. We die our current life, and then we arise in our new persons, right? And that's what baptism is. And so. Baptism has this connotation of a death to ourselves. And so it's not about can you have water sprinkle in my head, but can you take on the death of yourself?

When Jesus says, can you receive the baptism I receive? He's speaking about can you die so that you might live? Now they respond, uh, you know, a, a lot like my kids through the ages have responded. I, I like to carry the luggage from our car, uh, from the hotel, [00:21:00] uh, to our, to our car. And, uh, SSIR will always help me, uh, and, uh.

And, and I said, you wanna help? He said, sure. He, and he says, I can carry it and he will pick like the heaviest bag. And, and I said, well, go ahead and he'll, he'll pick it up intellectually, move it a few seconds. And he says, no, I can't, you take it. Uh, and, and that's how James and John, they said, yeah, I can carry it.

Uh. They answered rather. Yeah, with a lot of bravado, you know, not knowing what they're talking about, not knowing how heavy this load will be. Um, so I love that little anecdote 'cause I think it's a story about James and John's a story about us often. But the important point about this, I think is what Jesus then continues to say.

'cause he starts to. Playing how all of what's about to happen is connected with God's deliverance of God's people, God's deliverance of us. And he comes back to this metaphor that we have seen repeated again and again over the Lord, last [00:22:00] four to five weeks. How? How you can't understand God's redemptive plan.

You can't really participate in it. Fully and play your role in it unless you get this idea that the last shall be first and the first shall be lapsed. Until you get that, you're not gonna get through. You're not gonna get, be able to receive the kingdom and the, the, the, the dominion of God in your heart.

The way, uh, Jesus is teaching you. So what happens? Uh, well, we see that all the disciples got angry. The other disciples got angry with James and John because they had, you know, tried to corner the market on glory. Uh, and then Jesus says this important point, you know, um, he, he does, he, he teaches them, uh, what's wrong with the way they're thinking as they think of, uh, of, of their own glory.

As they walk along the way, and he, he, he, he invokes something, a, a lesson I think comes from the [00:23:00] Old Testament lesson that Steve skews read to us so well this morning. Uh, he says, you know, the ones who are considered the rulers by the Gentiles show off their authority over them and their high ranking officials order them around.

Uh, but that's not the way it's to be with you. And uh, and then he says this, this very important point. This is the way it's to be after I'm gone. Especially he's teaching them whoever wants to be first among you will be the doulas, the servant, the slave of all for the Messiah, didn't come to be served.

The side came to serve and to give his life to, to liberate many people. This is turning the world's values upside down folks. This wasn't anybody's understanding of what, uh, a ruler does. This is wasn't anyone's understanding of how one leads, this is Jesus teaching What? Truly [00:24:00] human leadership is servant leadership, one whose eyes are not seeking to be served, but seeking to serve.

That's how you are first among us. And I, I, I just want to point out that he invokes here the thing that we read from First Samuel, where, where the people. We're demanding that there be a king over then and, and, and, and God says to Samuel, go ahead and give him a king, but, but understand that they're asking for one of themselves to be king over you.

Is just, is, can only be understood as saying that they reject my reign, my reign, my godly reign. They reject that and prefer one of their own to be the one, uh, who reigns in their hearts. And when we do that, when we, when we, um, have, uh, these, these models of organizing, organizing ourselves that are based upon subordinating ourselves to a king.

We then get, we find ourselves in [00:25:00] exile and he gives this long litany that Steve read to this long litany that Steve, uh, read to us, uh, that, uh, turns out to be exactly when you read the story in the Old Testament. Exactly what happened to the Jews. All the things here, when you read the Bible from end end, you see this is like an outline of the story that is told from the Book of Kings all the way to the Jews being in exiled in Babylon.

And, and the important point is, I. That when you get a king, you will be that king's slaves. Uh, but you're not to be the, you know, the, you know, the, the slaves of any king. That's not how I designed you. That's not what your purpose is in life. No. You're to serve all I. Um, whoever wants to be great among you will be your servant.

So this, Jesus is saying, this is the way, this is what the way is. This is the way of the suffering servant. So what Jesus is talking about is, uh, how he is going to atone for our sins. [00:26:00] We need to remember that. That's Jesus's work. That's not something we do. He alone is the one who reconciles us. But we are to carry on that way.

Uh, beyond that, of living in this way on, uh, you know, in, in the way of the suffering servant, because this is how God is bringing out about the reconciliation of the world, our capacity as Jesus' disciples. To, to strive to be the servants of all living into this servant leadership model. Our leaving behind the possessions that would possess us and accepting the fact that God is liberating us from our possessions and liberating us from our needs to be, uh, the first among others so that we might be, uh, part of his kingdom.

And so, uh, Jesus is telling us that we are called to serve rather being served and that. Is our role in helping God redeem the world. So that's what Jesus has [00:27:00] said so far, and we have this wonderful story that Mark shared with us. And then we have the, you know, the story changes because they get to Jericho Jericho's 15 miles of north of Jerusalem.

And, and from Jericho you have an ascent. So right before you, you know, it's the Mount of the Holy Mountain, right? And right before you is. Is, uh, the mountain of Jerusalem and, and, uh, it's, uh, it's a thousand foot climb, you know, from Jericho up to that elevation and right there, uh, there, there was then, and there is now something that we see a lot in the United States, you know, beggars who were waiting for the, because every pilgrim had to go through from the north, had to go.

Through Jericho in order to get to the holy city. And there were, there was a constant flow of pilgrims. And so beggars would congregate there and, uh, and they would, um, meet the pilgrims and, and live off of the charity of the pilgrims. Um, and so that's where Jesus and his followers reached at this point in our [00:28:00] story.

And as Jesus was leaving Jericho. Enter into Jerusalem. Mark recalls that there was this blind beggar named Barima, Bartimaeus, meaning son of te, son of Timothy, basically, uh, today. Uh, and he was sitting on the side of the road. So I want you to visualize that and imagine something you've seen many times where someone.

Has a, a coat or a, a sheet or a blanket right in front of them. They're, they're on, they're sitting down on the street and, and, and, and you throw a coin or two or whatever you, you can offer to help them. And that's what this man is doing. That's what he's evidently been doing for a very long time. He's blind and he's a beggar.

Those two, those two, uh, identity points are very important to our story. And when he heard that Jesus was coming, obviously he had, had, uh, heard about who this person was and he, and he names Jesus correctly. He names him, son of David, meaning the, the Promised [00:29:00] Messiah. And he and he, and what he expects from him is something different.

He says, show me. Mercy, show me mercy. And the crowd sort of stifled me. You know, you know, this is the, there, there's something bigger going on here. You just be quiet. Don't get in the way. But they tried to quiet him down and he says, again, show me mercy. And Jesus stops. Call him full. And the people you know get on board with that.

Okay? Oh, he's calling you. Be, be encouraged. And then notice this, the man throws his coat to the side. He jumps up, then he goes to Jesus, and Jesus asks him the same question that he asked James and John, what do you want me to do for you? The same question he's asking you today. The blind man says, teacher, I want to see c.

Jesus says, go. Your faith has healed you. And when Mark tells us that the blind man was able to see [00:30:00] instantly and he followed Jesus, where did he go? Well, we know where he went. He went to Jerusalem, so he followed Jesus to Jerusalem. This is, I think, a, a profound illustration that Mark is giving us of this unexpected recruit.

This was a man at the very bottom. He was the least of us. He was not only blind, but he was impoverished and he, he was, I. He was one who was, uh, for a male at the lowest level of social acceptability. He didn't have a bunch of possessions. So he's in stark contrast to the man that we saw last week. He had no possessions that he had to go to sell all he had with coins in his blanket.

And what did he do when he met Jesus? He threw up his coat. So when I think of that, I think of all coins that were collected, they're just spilling everywhere, and he's leaving it all behind instantly and he's following Jesus. And so the blind beggar Mark shows us this incredible contrast. The blind beggar, and not the rich man is the one who [00:31:00] follows Jesus.

And interestingly enough, the blind beggar's vision is restored. But as we remember last week, it's the rich man who went away blind. He was unable to see his possessions rightly. He didn't get it. And so it's the blind beggar who had the eyes to see. And when he saw he followed. And there's a contrast, not just with the rich man.

There's a contrast with James and John now. They asked, uh, Jesus asked them the question, what do you want me to do, James? And John said he, John James said, give me, give us the seats of honor. Make us visible next to you. And Bartimaeus said, Jesus asked the same question. What do you want me to do? And he says, I just wanna see.

I want to see what an incredible contrast mark has shown here, and I think that Bartimaeus Mark is saying is for us the paradigm of a disciple. He knows that he's blind. He [00:32:00] knows his status, he knows he's made of dust. He understands his complete dependence on God. He knows he needs Jesus' help and he, he.

Persistent. He will not be stifled in his pleas for help. And, uh, he also takes a different posture. He doesn't speak of entitlement. He doesn't say, how can I inherit, how can I obtain, what can I, how can I check the boxes so that I get, uh, eternal life? No, he asks for mercy, not for something for which he's entitled.

But some from the posture of one who brings nothing, offers nothing that would justify, he's asking for unmerited grace because he knows he can't merit grace and he leaps at the chance to receive help from Jesus and he follows him. Folks, I think this is the paradigm of what we're called to be his disciples, to recognize our own blindness.

And so what happens here Will Jesus. I think in this [00:33:00] story, uh, it gives us very good news because he is turning upside down the values and helping us to see the values that we must hold onto. If we are to be fully human. The human one is showing us how to be human. All of what God intends humanity to be, the fullness of that.

And, and, and he's telling us that the key for us is to recognize That means that, that we recognize it's our fundamental to our identity. That we are called to serve rather than be served when we are, when we are seeking always to be served. We are not being human. We are being something that is less than human.

It dehumanizes us to live such a life. And Jesus' purpose, we are told here is to liberate us. Our suffering has a purpose just as His did. And so when we suffer, uh, God is teaching us. Somehow through our suffering, how to love, how to love our fellows, and how to love God more [00:34:00] deeply, God's removing those obstacles and it's through our efforts to serve others.

That's the key, because that's the way in which we participate in Jesus' body, through our self offering, we participate in his self offering. That relationship with God is thereby deepen. And so thereby Jesus heals us. He heals our blindness, uh, when we approach him with someone who is truthful about our complete dependence on God for all that we have.

Uh, and, and thereby will learn to walk side by side. Him along the way he leads. So I think this is extraordinary. Good news, folks, on this day, may we, uh, take this to heart and be transformed and have, uh, our own astigmatisms, uh, healed somewhat today as we hear this message and the Father, son the Holy Spirit.

[00:35:00] Amen.
