# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 7

[00:00:00] Well, good morning folks. Today we continue in our. Walking through the gospel of Mark, uh, story by story. And we have a, a, a story that's very similar to last week's story here today where we have a healing by Jesus. But then we, we see that, uh, the plot, uh, thickens as Jesus, uh, uh, does something so offensive that, uh, the Pharisees ally with their natural enemies, those who, uh, who, who mark, uh, calls the Herodians, uh, those who support herd and kipa.

Uh, who collaborates with Rome and, uh, and they begin a collaboration, uh, that would ultimately lead to Jesus' crucifixion. And then we see Jesus, uh, calling from all the disciples who are now following him. They're following him from east, west, north, and south and, and such, uh, and in such numbers and with such great demand on him that he needs to, uh, have them have a boat ready.

[00:01:00] So. Uh, the sons of Zeb Boats and Peter's boats, uh, you know, seem to be made available so that he's, then we'll see him hence forth, often going out to, uh, into the Sea of Galilee and preaching from there so that he could, uh, be effective and also be safe. Uh, and then he does another thing he. He, uh, organizes the disciples by calling, uh, a group that he would hint forth, mark that is, would hint forth, call the 12.

And so 12, uh, apostles, 12 messengers who, uh, would be the leaders of all the. Hundreds of disciples, uh, that, uh, he has already gathered from east, west, north, east, west, north, and south. And, uh, one of these obviously, you know, he just like Moses, he goes to the mountaintop and then he calls the 12, uh, recogniz, you know, uh, symbolizing the 12 tribes of Israel, uh, reconstituted.

So an interesting story that carries along our plot line, and I wanna make sure we don't miss that. But, uh, but given that I'd like for us today to. [00:02:00] To focus on this story of healing and this story of Jesus taking on, uh, those of us who have, uh, what, what Mark calls, uh, hardened spiritual arteries. He talked about hardened hearts, and I wanna make just really three major points today.

And the first one is to think about orthodoxies. And, uh, what they mean to us. Uh, orthodoxies are, are important part of our life. They're important part of our life, uh, within the church. They're, you know, within the life of faith and then within our work, um, and within our home, uh, in all aspects of life, we have orthodoxies, orthodox, what orthodoxy, uh, means, simply right thinking.

And, uh, and they, they are things that we, ourselves gather, uh, as is, is really received wisdom. Uh, by which we are to navigate life. Uh, and they are meant to be blessings. And so that's the first point. And and I, I wanted to have us drill down a little bit by focusing on one sentence here [00:03:00] that, uh, was read to us from the acts of the Apostles lesson today by Chris.

Uh, and that is Peter, by the way. I wanna make sure you notice the, uh, little play on words here. Petros, Peter Petross, a name. Uh, you know Simon, who's been renamed Petros The Stone, uh, you know, stands up and he says this, Jesus, you know, Petross is speaking this, Jesus is the petros, the stone that was rejected by you, the builder who, who had become the cornerstone.

Of course, he's quoting Psalm one 18, but then he goes on to say something important. I wanted to highlight here, there is salvation in no one else. There is salvation in no one else. What does that mean? That's a pretty bold statement and a statement that, uh, can make us uncomfortable as we encounter other world religions and, and, uh, and, and we, and we encounter our secular humanist friends in, in.

No one else is their salvation. So let's drill down a little bit about that, and as we think about this notion of orthodoxy, uh, orthodoxies that [00:04:00] are meant to bless, the first thing that I want to remind us, we, we could go to Romans chapter one, verse 1617. We could go other places and we would, we would see, uh, within the New Testament, this understanding, uh, exactly in fact, we would go to, to, uh, John.

Uh, John's prologue, John one, it says, in the beginning was the word and the word was God. And the worst, uh, was, was with God. The Word was God. Uh, in, in, in, in, in multiple places, we see this statement that, uh, Christ is God's logos. The logos, uh, the logos, uh, in Greek thought was, uh, the means by which we encounter all reality and it becomes comprehensible to us.

So it's God's word to us, which makes all of reality. Something that our brains can, uh, comprehend. And, uh, it is, it is something that it transcends time and transcends all spaces. And so it governs all spaces, all times of our lives. There is no compartment, uh, by which we can [00:05:00] expect, we can escape this governance of, uh, the governor of the world.

That's the, the, the classical. Medieval name for Jesus. You know, the Governor general of the universe. The Christ is God's logo. This word to us, this is something we say and the Christ remember becomes in fleshed. So there never was a time when we were without the Christ, uh, Christ. I. Proce, you know, Christ always was.

And then, uh, at his, at, at the birth of Jesus Christ becomes in flesh. But before Jesus was born, the Christ still was. And after Jesus died, the Christ still is the governor of the world. This is a, an essential claim of our, of monotheism, that the word is eternal. And, uh, we have this concept called the eternal law.

And remember, I've, I've suggested to you that law doesn't mean like, you know, your speed limit law. Law, uh, is, is a, is an, is an English translation of the word, the Greek word nomos, um, which, uh, really is better translated in [00:06:00] our, in our day as instruction. It's, it's God's guidance and the way I like to think of it as God's map given to us is, here's how you live.

In, uh, fellowship with me and with each other. Here's, here's the roadmap to doing that. This is how I lead you to the still waters. Uh, 'cause I'm your shepherd, as we've said earlier in our prayers this morning. Um, and so this is the, this is the means by which God guides us. And so one of the questions then that, that, that begs is how do we discern God's will?

And I wanna remind you some of the guys you know, as good Episcopalians, most of you. Uh, grew up in the Episcopal church, some of you did not, but you, you could ate, probably answer the, you know, the, the, the question from, from the catechism of how do we discern God's will And, and, and, and Episcopalians, would typ typically refer to, uh, the, uh, the, the triangle?

Uh, by, by Richard Hooker, uh, you know, of scripture tradition and, and, uh, reason. Uh, and so, so through through the gift of [00:07:00] scripture, we discern God's will, and that's our primary source. That's our primary witness to, to the life of the of, of, of. God with us and all that we have received, particularly in God's intervention, in our relationship through the gift of Jesus.

And so scripture is our primary source of authority. But then we receive through, uh, through, through the church and, and through, uh, our various fellowships traditions, uh, by which we interpret that word. And, and, uh, it is, it becomes manifest in all sorts of laws. That are, uh, that are in fact legislative or are judicially, uh, mediated, uh, or simply customs that we receive in our families and in our communities.

And so through, through scripture and tradition and then through, uh, dialectical conversations with each other, uh, uh, guided by. Our effort to mutually live, uh, with Jesus, you know, [00:08:00] when two or three, two or more gathered in his name when we gathered in his name, and we dialectically try to discern God's will, that we see.

We say that we are guided towards to, to, to discernment of God's will through our reason, that gift that we've been given, the spirit comes alongside so that we might, it, it testifies to the truth so that we might discern God's will. And then, and then, and then I would add the, the, you know, the, the, the, the, uh, the.

Amendment to, to, uh, the hookers, uh, uh, you know, tripod of the Wesleyan Quadrilateral, John Wesley. A good Anglican added a fourth one. And that is our experience of the Holy Spirit. And this is, and this is simply an acknowledgement that, that, that the spirit does intervene in our, in our world, in our communities, in our lives, and then guides us individually to so that we know the truth.

And so these are ways that, that we. Discern God's will, uh, God's logos. And so, uh, the important point that I wanna make [00:09:00] is that these traditions, these laws, these customs, uh, embed a gift. They embed the gift of the good, the map, whereas passed down to us from generation to generation 10 generation this.

So, so we're able to speak of the faith of, of our fathers and our mothers, and we're, we're able to speak of. A foundation. A Sure Foundation. And, and, and this is a gift that is passed on, uh, from generation to generation. Um, and it is good. And, and we ought to receive it with respect and with humility. Um, and that humility, uh, is what leads us to receive orthodoxies, uh, to accept them, uh, as, as, uh.

As worthy of our due consideration whenever we are seeking to discern God's will. And so what is an orthodoxy? Well, it is this, it is, it is all of these things I've been talking about. Uh, these, these, [00:10:00] these embodied dosa, these embodied, um, uh, um, cult enculturated ways of being that are simply the way we grow up.

So, uh, we live and move and have our being in this word that surrounds us, but it's embedded in these, in these, um, cultural artifacts that, you know, can, you know, that we receive is law or custom or whatever, and that they are good. And so it's right and proper for us to give, to give them respect. So they're meant to bless.

The problem is that our orthodoxies. Aren't always blessings in the way that we pass them on and the way we, um, enforce them. And so that leads us to our lesson today. So for, for as we have been speaking about, uh, Jesus is out to disrupt the social order as we see in the gospel of Mark, we've gone through chapters one and two.

We've already seen that. Uh, now we're in chapter three and we see [00:11:00] Jesus now. Engaging, uh, the Pharisees once again, the scribes of the Pharisees, actually the, the, the, you know, the scribes are the guardians of orthodoxies. Uh, the scribes are those who are the scribes of the Pharisees are those who are the guardians of the orthodoxies, as interpolated by the political movement.

That was the SAIC movement in the, in the, uh, last couple of centuries. Uh, uh, before Jesus and, and in, in, in continued in the rabbinic tradition. And so what we encounter in our story is Jesus is going to engage, once again, these scribes of the Pharisees, and he's gonna do it in a way that combines, uh, the stories we've been talking about in the, in the, in the last couple of weeks.

You know, once we, we saw Jesus engage. In the synagogue. And then another time we saw him healing at Peter's mother, uh, Peter's mother's ha uh, mother-in-law, uh, in, in healing of Peter's mother-in-law at his own home. And then we've seen Jesus do other healings well in this story today, all of those [00:12:00] elements are combined into this extraordinary political theater where Jesus is, is, um, intentionally, uh, and very openly engaging, uh, those who have challenged him, whereas before.

He would just simply do the act and they would challenge him. This time, he stages, he stages something to make a point. So he returns to the synagogue and there is a man with a withered hand. And uh, and there were those in the group who wanted to bring charges against him. And those were the, the scribes of the Pharisees.

And so they were scrutinizing him, watching closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. I tell you when I read this, I cannot help but think about the civil rights movement and how. The, uh, um, you know, they, for example, bull Connor's men down in Birmingham would watch as, as, as, uh, as as Pastor Shuttleworth and, and, uh, and Pastor King and others, uh, Dr.

King would, uh. Would walk out of their [00:13:00] hotel and as they, as, as they left, as they left the 16th Avenue Baptist Church, uh, they had their men sitting there waiting to see if they would, uh, march and protest against the, the judges injunction. And as soon as they did anything that looked like that, they would swoop down on them and arrest them and throw them into jail.

And so, and that's the, that was the posture of those who were angered by Jesus' Prophetic acts. There's a man with a withered hand. The man with a withered hand is something that we need to contemplate. This is a person, uh, who according to, uh, the oral traditions, had no business even being in the synagogue, and that's derived from Leviticus 21.

Verse 16 and following, in which, uh, uh, uh, the, the law says that no one who has a blemish shall draw near the holy of holies. No one who is blind or lame, or who has a mutilated face or limb too long, or has a broken foot or broken hand, or a hunchback or awar, or any sort of [00:14:00] blemish can draw near. Into the Holy of Holies is actually into the temple.

Uh, is is what's spoken about here. And of course, as we've spoken about, the Pharisees have tried to liberalize the, the, the, the media of redemption by say, by by, by moving it from the zip code of the. Temple out in, in, in, out, into, uh, the, the, the provinces beyond Judea. And so here we are in Galilee and they're in a synagogue.

And so through their interpolations, the rabbinic, uh, discussions, a, a lame man had no business being in this holy space, and particularly Jesus had no business, uh, violating the orthodoxy about work. On the Sabbath in healing the interpolations of the Pharisees or, uh, ordained, uh, was a violation of the Sabbath.

It was work. Um, and then, and then, and then more than that, Jesus's going to do both of these things, both heal someone who had [00:15:00] no business being in the synagogue. And, and then healed that person on the Sabbath, uh, as, as a person who didn't have any, in any sort of authority, invested in him by office as would ascribe.

And so, uh, an awful lot of orthodoxies being challenged in, in one moment by Jesus. And as I said, this is political theory. The theater, he stands, he hasn't done a thing. There's a withered man there. Jesus calls him up. He says, look here today. I've set before you live actually, uh, let me, let me back up. I wanted to, before I get back into this, to uh, to understand what Jesus says, Jesus is gonna quote Deuteronomy, he's gonna quote Moses or make an allusion to Moses.

Moses, uh, in, in, in, uh, de Deuteronomy 30 has just recounted God. Instructed, he just recounted his version of, of Torah to the, to the, to the, uh, 12 tribes of Israel who were standing on the, the banks of the river Jordan, [00:16:00] about to in inhabit the Promised Land, about to cross the river Jordan into the Promised Land.

And he, and he puts before them this summer and he says, look here today, I've set before you life. And what's good. Versus death and what's wrong. So he creates this dichotomy. Moses has this very famous dichotomy that then in rabbinic, uh, discussions ever, at, ever since Deuteronomy, uh, has set forth this understanding that there's a choice before us between good and evil and, and death and life now.

And he says, now choose life so that, uh, so that you may. Uh, you may prosper in the land I've put before you. So Jesus is gonna invoke this in a very interesting way. So, so he calls up this man with the withered hand. Uh, he, he said to the man with the withered hand, step up where people can see you. Then he said to them, to the scribes, the Pharisees asks the question that Moses had asked, but he asked it in an interesting way.

This, this dichotomy I mentioned. [00:17:00] So, you know, the law, is it legal? On the Sabbath to do good or to do evil. Is it legal on the Sabbath to save life or to kill? Now folks, I want you to think about that question. If you were describes the Pharisees, which is the safe answer, if you answer yes or no. You condemn yourself and your orthodoxies if you are to say it's legal on the the Sabbath to do good.

Well, then you are agreeing with Jesus. Uh, and, and, and certainly you can't say it's, it's legal to do evil and, and or, and or that it's, it's legal to, to kill. So he ask the question in, in a really sharp way, and of course they say nothing. They're not gonna be drawn in. And then it says, he looks around them with anger and, and the word there is a really severe.

Anger, [00:18:00] it grieved at their heartened arteries. The, their unyielding hearts. They've seen all the healing. They know the, the, they know the meaning of the Sabbath, or at least they should. And yet they, uh, are, are unable to look with grace upon this man with a withered hand and grant him the space, uh, within the holy space of God, uh, to flourish as they flourish.

And so there is anger here, and we ought to remember as an aside that anger itself is not evil. It's what we do in our anger that becomes evil at times. Anger though is a, is an appropriate reaction, uh, when we see hardened hearts. And so we said to the man, stretch out your hand. The man did and in instant, his hand was made healthy, remarkable political theater here.

Jesus challenging them and just speaking, telling the man to stretch out his hand and healing him in the [00:19:00] moment.

At that point, the scripture tells, as Mark tells us, it, it's that point that, uh, the political theater is over. The, the Pharisees, uh, collaborate with the, the Herodians, and they begin the path that leads to the cross, the story of the cross. We will see once again, the Herodians and the Pharisees, uh, plotting Jesus' death in chapter 12 of Mark's gospel.

So my point being, the second point is that our orthodoxies often curse, and that was certainly the, uh, something that was true for the, um, the man with the withered hand. And I was, I wanna share with you some of, uh, some, some of some of these orthodoxies that I've experienced. Uh, and it, that, that, I'm sure you could add many of your own, but one of the things that's memorable to me as I think of this story was, uh, when I was ordained and became ordained a priest, I, I can never.

Forget, uh, the uh. The time when a a, a priest, whom I [00:20:00] really admired, he is actually a bishop, um, wrote me a note and just wanted to remind me that because I was ordained and, and ordained as a priest within the Episcopal Church, which was not in full communion with the Methodist church, that I must not, must not ever again.

Uh, commune in, in Holy Eucharist with my mother and dad who are Methodists, uh, because we are not in full communion as a church, and I'm an officer of the Episcopal church now, so he'd be, wanna make sure I understand that I not, uh, violate that, that his notion of orthodoxy. Uh, uh, I, I know that many of you have experienced this in our own church's history folks who.

Who in their understanding of who may be a priest, um, that, uh, that they decided that well orthodoxy led them, that they should not, it would not ever take communion from a woman. I know that that has happened with actually within our particular parish, uh, or from, uh, a gay priest or [00:21:00] from a disabled priest.

I had that at St. Thomas when I had, uh, the first priest in the Episcopal church as my curate who had, um. Um. Muscular dystrophy and was in a wheelchair. And we had folks in the congregation who helped that, that she, she, uh, she was not someone who, from whom they could take communion. Uh, there's a famous story that I remember about Martin Luther, uh, who, uh, in medieval times challenged one of the orthodoxies of the church.

There was a child who was who he, he had tutored who was a, a child born out of wedlock, and the child fell. Uh, and died and, uh, hit his head and died. And the, and because he was born out of wedlock, born out of what the community considered to be sin, uh, the, the belief of orthodoxy was that he must not be buried within church grounds.

Uh, in great anger, much like Jesus's righteous anger, Martin Luther, Martin [00:22:00] Luther took on the orthodoxy of his own church and refused to let that be true and with his own hands, uh, dug the grave for the, uh, for that child. Uh. Um, some of you ha have suffered disease. Some of you are currently suffering disease.

I've shared with you the story of the man who, uh, cried with me because he didn't, he could not believe that God would've punished him and punished his wife with cancer, uh, so that she died. Uh, but, but, and he, and he was just taking on, um, as, as an orthodoxy that, uh, her, her cancer was evidence of God's judgment against them.

There are those of you I know today who still hold on to such, uh, beliefs that are not, uh, rooted in Christianity. That are certainly not rooted in Jesus's teaching, but re rooted in cultural approbations, uh, that, uh, a, uh, accretions that you have [00:23:00] absorbed that, that, that, that, that where you by, uh, whereby you interpret your own disease, your own fallibility, your own frailty, uh, as some kind of judgment upon you.

Uh, and, and this is a, a stigma, uh, that is, that Jesus is, is, is constantly reminding us, uh, is is not what God intends in the roadmap God gave us to still waters. Um, we recently received a note about our own bishop. Uh, and the divorce through which he's going and, and, uh, there's a stigma. Many of, many of the folks I know, uh, who have gone through divorce have really struggled, uh, with divorce of their children, divorce of themselves, divorce of, of friends, and, and they feel this, this, uh, anxiety and a, and a stigma being attached.

And so, and they struggle because the orthodoxies have taught them that that stigma. That that divorce is, is, is a sin. And certainly we in the Episcopal church [00:24:00] named the tragedy of divorce as, as this is not what God desires for us. One of the conversations that I've had with our bishop recently is, is uh, is understanding that God is ever good, God is.

Ever creative. And there are times when, uh, marriages, uh, reach a point at which marriages are no longer marriage because, uh, the, the, the couple is no longer capable of, of loving each other. In the way that Christ loves us, which is what makes our marriages holy. And so, uh, divorce is simply a, a means by which we name something that is already true.

The marriage no longer exists, uh, in, in the way that we would make it, that it, that makes it recognizable. And, uh, and so, uh, one of the things that, uh, prince and I spoke about is recognizing. Uh, divorce as God's creative period at the end of the sentence that allows us to [00:25:00] have and experience the resurrection that God desires for us.

And I know that many of you have experienced that and I have witnessed it, uh, in so many parts of my own life. Uh, but this is one of the orthodoxies, uh, that, that curses us. Uh, there's a, a stigma of wedlock. I've talked about the bastard child who was un. Who, who Orthodoxy said could not be buried, uh, within the church grounds.

Uh, even to this day, uh, there are those of us who, who, uh, look upon children, uh, who are, who are born in the wrong order, uh, as, as somehow, uh, less than children, uh, and, and, and their parents, uh, being less. Than other parents, um, because they did things in the wrong order. And, uh, I, I always smile at that because I know my church history and the notion of, of, uh, of that is very Victorian.

Uh, at least in, in the West, I. Uh, but, but, but we have these stigmas that bring, bring about shame and Jesus comes [00:26:00] and tries to disrupt that. Whether you have a withered hand or any of the things I've mentioned. One of the things that I also wanna mention about, um, about orthodoxies is the, the role of the state.

We have many churches that, uh. Are are called Orthodox churches, you know, starting with the, uh, Orthodox Church in Bulgaria, in Russia and other places throughout. There are many churches that are called the Orthodox Church of this or that. And these are examples of churches that were co-opted by, uh, the rise of the, the nation state, uh, rise in, in this case of kings, uh, who co-opted the church and took control.

Of the church and defined what proper worship would be allowed within their dominion so that they were able to control, uh, the definition of what right thinking was so that it went along, not with what Jesus's teaching was always, but rather with what? Um. With what the, the, the, the, the [00:27:00] royalty what the, those in power, uh, wanted to have.

And Jesus is constantly challenging that. That's exactly the story we've been talking about. So orthodoxies are, are meant to be blessings, but orthodoxies often cursed. And we ought to ask, why is it that our orthodoxies often cursed? Why is it that we find ourselves, uh, receiving Jesus's ga with. Anger, Jesus being deeply grieved at, at, at our, translating these maps to the still waters, into maps to shame, and very, very, um, you know, um, tumultuous waters, waters of chaos rather than waters of peace.

Well, to get at that, I wanted to, to bring about, uh, just talk about something briefly that, uh, is, is known as the Protestant principle. Some of you may have heard of it. Uh, it is, uh, something that was well documented taught by a, a theologian 20th century named Paul Tillek. Uh, he's famous for it, but he's actually simply.

[00:28:00] Um, recapitulating the classical teachings, uh, you know, principally from St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo in the, in the, in the, uh, year round 400, uh, 30. Uh, and, and the Protestant principle is something that I think we should hang onto and remember, particularly this's Easter, and particularly when we encounter any of these orthodoxies in our lives that, uh, that we see.

Creating people, uh, and, and casting people out of the circle of God's love. And so the pro Protestant principle simply recognizes that we, we live east of Eden. We live in a world that has fallen. We live in a world, as we talked about on Easter Sunday, in which we ourselves have this, this tendency to in fear, uh, move towards idolatry.

And we also are, are people who live, uh, in, in a, in a. In a world in which there are the powers and principalities that are seeking to tempt us, [00:29:00] uh, as Paul talks about, and to take advantage of our own weaknesses and our own fallenness. And so there are finite things and, and these finite things can grasp us and take over our faith.

Then, and then pose as though they are God's word, when they are in fact the opposite of God's word. And again, and again and again, and we do this. And so the Protestant principle recognizes this characteristic of us that in our fallenness we tend to, uh, be grasped by finite things and, and, uh, and see them as God.

God ordained things. And, and so one of the things that, uh, the Protestant principle does is it suggests that we look upon all of our received dosa, our received laws, our received traditions, our received customs, uh, whether they are within our community, within our nation, within our family, uh, within our faith.

And, and to see them as inherently ambiguous [00:30:00] because they are mediated by we, by us, our, uh, us. We, you know, finite creatures who, who imperfectly discern God's word, always imperfectly, discern God's word. And so we receive them and we named them as good, but that which we receive is good. We name as ambiguously good.

The, the good is found right there. You know, the gold is right there. Immersed in, in, in, uh, the, the, you know, the igneous rock. And so sometimes we get confused about which is which, but it's ambiguous. And so we have to be very careful to discern together, which is which. And so the premise is that all the things that we encounter, all the material things in our lives, all the institutional things that we receive as part of our lives and that we create as part of our lives, uh.

Intended by God to point beyond ourselves, to point beyond this finite world, to something that is, that is eternal, that transcends time, that transcend transcends our spaces. [00:31:00] That's, that's an inexhaustible love, uh, that is beyond our capacity to comprehend, but is the very depth. Of our lives. Uh, and and so the premise is that that's the purpose of all finite things.

They are not themselves, the end, they are, excuse me, not them. They themselves are not the means, but rather, uh, the, the, uh, um, I'll get it right. They are not the end, but the means that, that, that. Point to the things that, uh, to which we should claim, uh, which is what Augustine said. So all finite things point beyond themselves to the, to the o, to the one God who is infinite.

And that's our premise. And therefore, we are, uh, a little skeptical, always skeptical of the maps that we receive. We see them as good, but yet we have a, a prophetic eye. That, that is always inspecting the good we received, uh, and the way that we carry on the good that we have received and distort the good that we've received against the, our own tendencies towards idolatry, against our own [00:32:00] tendencies to have religious pride.

Our church is the way they are not. Our church is, are the ones who were holy. We are the righteous ones. They are not, whether that's within the church or within the community. I remember a story I've just read, uh, uh, uh, a Black Baptist church in Georgia in the 1960s. Uh, a man rose who, uh, to speak in his church and spoke very eloquently and moved many within the church.

Um. To, uh, stand up and begin mar uh, marching and, and supporting the students against students, uh, student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, uh, community, community, I can get it right. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Committee, uh, to, to get them to help people get registered to vote. He spoke very eloquently and moved many people to his side.

And immediately the senior pastor stood up in the pulpit, preached a sermon against this, uh, saying it was in orthodox, would only lead to God's [00:33:00] judgment and then immediately excommunicated him. And all of those who had been persuaded from him, from the, from that, uh, church. Uh, we have religious pride, we have ecclesial pride, and then we also, um, uh, have a, you know, we, we have a, a word to speak against all of our.

Tendencies towards a, a, a, a secular self-sufficiency, whether that be, be via the acquisition of wealth, our military might, uh, or other means of power. So there's a, we receive all of these dosa, all these customs, but we look at them with a critical eye in our generation, each generation, and with the assumption that God is creating all things new, and that's what we mean by Easter eyesight.

That we receive the good from previous generations. We expect God to be bursting the old wine skins and creating new wine skins and filling in them with the fresh wine That is the wine of our time. And so therefore, we refuse to [00:34:00] fall into this heresy by which we circumscribed God's love and we build fences around the Eucharistic.

Table, assuming that God is always challenging us to expand, to push beyond the present in to, to, uh, to expand the fellowship of God's love and, and our own fellowship to all brothers and sisters, we encounter and love, uh, brothers and sisters, uh, that's what we call Easter eyes. I pray that each of us today will be especially blessed with that vision as we remember these stories in the name of the Father and son, the Holy Spirit.

Amen.
