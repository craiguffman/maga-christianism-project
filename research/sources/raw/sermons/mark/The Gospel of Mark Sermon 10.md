# The Gospel of Mark Sermon 10

[00:00:00] [00:01:00] [00:02:00] [00:03:00] [00:04:00] [00:05:00] [00:06:00] [00:07:00] [00:08:00] [00:09:00] [00:10:00] [00:11:00] [00:12:00] [00:13:00] [00:14:00] [00:15:00] [00:16:00] [00:17:00] [00:18:00] [00:19:00] [00:20:00] [00:21:00] [00:22:00] [00:23:00] [00:24:00] [00:25:00] [00:26:00] [00:27:00] [00:28:00] [00:29:00] [00:30:00] Today we continue with a host of stories, uh, from the gospel of Mark, uh, and uh, from the prophet Isaiah. [00:31:00] All of which, uh, uh, uh, lead us to a, a new place in our understanding of this new kingdom that Jesus is inaugurating. As you know, we've been working through the gospel of Mark, uh, learning to read it in a literary way as a work of art.

The work of art. It is. So in many cases, we're taking a step, uh, back, uh, so that we don't get lost in the details so much. Uh, but see the big picture. If you can imagine Mark taking. Paint and throwing it on a cannabis and, and asking why did he include this here and this one here? What was he trying to convey to us so that we might understand this portrait he's creating, uh, in order to help us answer the question, who is this Jesus?

And so today we have a very interesting set of, of. Doublets, uh, that, that we're going to talk about. Uh, uh, they're, they're, we've read them both. Uh, one concurs in chapter five, another one in chapter seven. In between, we have a, a [00:32:00] bunch of feedings. And, and once again, as I've spoken to you about before in this period when with Jesus's focusing on his disciples, mark has, uh, matched pairs.

And today we see a matched pair of stories. One which in which, uh, which occurs, uh, with, with Jesus's ministry to the Jews announcing the kingdom there. And the other two, which, uh, are very much parallel stories with very, uh, strong similarities, uh, that occur in his, uh, surprising ministry to the Gentiles.

And so today we're gonna talk about that. But as I was thinking about that, my thought, thoughts, this.

Uh, to, um, the, uh, thing that, uh, Dave Morris has reminded us, uh, an awful lot about lately and Bonnie, and that is to my dog, uh, wanted you guys to know, uh, that, uh, not only your dogs worship with us, but, uh, my dog Sadie is always around. Uh, [00:33:00] and, and, uh, but well, but well trained, so you don't actually get to hear over Zoom.

Uh, but I was thinking about her as I thought about these stories because one of the things about Sadie. Sadie's, the, the, uh, endearment for the term Sarah Sadie is the, is the blondish looking goldendoodle. There you can see Sadie, uh, being held by, by my daughter Emily. Emily's my, my, my youngest daughter, uh, and Sadie's five years old.

Uh, and I love her. She's run lots and lots of miles with me. Uh, and she is a, a, a tremendous joy to me. One of the things that that made me think about her was about her relationship with, uh, what, uh, the, the, the one whom SUNY says is her cousin. Uh, the, the other golden doodle. Yes. That black and white pup there by her playing is another goldendoodle.

Um, and, and that's, uh, my daughter, my older daughter, Callie's, uh, puppy. Uh, she, she's now, that's Maggie. Maggie is now older than a year. But the, [00:34:00] the thing that interested me with regard to these stories that made me think about them was, was an observation. As I said, Sadie is about four years older than Maggie.

And when they first met, they, they met here in our home. And it was very interesting to see how very immediately there was a, a hierarchy established. Uh, you know, Sadie would eat first and Maggie then would beat what, uh, whatever Sadie left. And, uh, in terms of where they slept and all that, well, there was always this deference of the pup to the elder.

And of course, Sadie taught her how to play and those types of things. But what was interesting to me was what happened like a year later, uh, when suddenly, Maggie. Was much larger than Sadie. Sadie only weighs like 38 pounds, and Maggie is, uh, at least one and a half times her size and very strong and clearly able to push her around if she wants.

But when they, we went to Callie's house and they played together, we saw that same dynamic, that same pack [00:35:00] mentality in which Sadie would eat Maggie's food and Sadie would sleep in the preferred position. And Maggie seemed to be just fine with that, that, uh, knowing her place in the pack. Um, and, and I, I was thinking about that because that's something that we humans find very comforting, knowing our place, our, our, you know, the coordinates of, of our locations in life.

I don't know if, uh, you guys have been to Salt Lake City enough to have to have driven around in it before, but one of the things that I was thinking about as I thought about this, this, this comfort we get in, in having the coordinates of of our lives that tell us where we are anytime was, was, uh, thinking about the town of Salt Lake City and how there, uh, their whole city is laid out with such coordinates.

If you remember the XY. Uh, graphing that we used to do, you know, x equals three y equals four, and you plot it on the, on the, on the chart right up here. Uh, you know, most of us, you know, like, have, have street addresses like 1, 2, 3 Main, but, [00:36:00] but in Salt Lake City, you, they, you always know where you are. You always know your location.

Uh, and, and there's a comfort for us in that. So it's really easy to give someone directions, but the addresses are different than ours. And so everything is based, you can see in the right hand, uh, uh, photo there, you can see the, the basal image at the foot of the temple. In Salt Lake, the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake.

And that is the base from which all, uh, addresses are derived and everything is based on how many blocks they are from that simple. I mean that, that the basal, uh, device there. Uh, so, so all addresses are. So many blocks to the north or south and so many blocks to the east or west. And so all, all addresses, you see streets like you see there.

You know the, the block that is 500 west, the block that is 300 south. And so you'd get a, you, you'd get really odd addresses like 500 West, 300 South, uh, would be your [00:37:00] address, giving you this comfort of knowing where you are and where you belong and how to get to wherever you're going. That's something that's a, a, a form of, of salvation really.

It's a way, it's a form of grace, certainly giving us this type of ordering in our life and taken to, uh, taken to the extreme in Salt Lake by its reference where the, the primary reference point is, is the temple, their temple. But one of the things that happens with us is that we tend to take these things that are gifts that are order, and we tend to distort them, make them, uh, things that are.

That are merely intended to give us comfort and make it easy for us to, to manage the distribution of, of food and all the other blessings of life. And we tend to make them sacrosanct and create these human hierarchies of value that we've been talking about. And in today's stories, those are the context of our Bible stories very much.

And if we, if we're not thinking in these terms, we can miss the whole point that of what Mark is painting on his canvas. Um, [00:38:00] understanding that Jesus is going into a culture where this type of. Honor system, this type of honor and shame system is, is, is a given. And to see what Jesus is doing with those honor, shame, uh, coordinates.

Now, when you talk about an honor system, we've talked about this before, what it means is that there are certain boundaries that we learned to respect. And those boundaries tell us what we can do. And, and those boundaries, uh, tend to consist of the power that you can, uh, you can project, you can execute.

Uh, they, they determine your status, uh, in terms of gender and they determine when you interact with someone else where you rank on the social ladder, sort of like Maggie and Sadie who deferred, uh, to Sadie always to let Sadie. Get the first choice of the food. Um, now, so one of the things that's important about this is how these things work is, is that honor is, is a concept that is, is, um, uh, performed by both sides of any interaction there.

Uh, if I'm [00:39:00] interacting with you, I make a certain claim when I interact with you to a certain place, a certain station. Now, uh, when our society is nice and orderly, uh, you would ideally acknowledge. Socially, my, the worth that I am claiming. And, and, and so that's the assumption is that, uh, I make a claim about my worth.

You acknowledge it, and then we go ahead and conduct our transaction. That's how it's supposed to work. Uh, the, these systems tend to work throughout the world, in every type of society now. So the purpose of honor is. That, that, that we sort of have a ranking in our society, a social rating, and that rating where we sit, where you know, what our coordinates are in our society, entitle us.

Uh, they entitle us to, to, uh, certain ways that we can expect to be treated whenever we interact with somebody. Uh, and so, so if I'm interacting with a peer, then we'll, we'll speak to each other in a particular way. If I'm, if I'm interacting with someone senior to [00:40:00] me, then, then we'll then I'll use a different language.

I'm talk. If I'm, if I'm interacting with somebody junior to me, I'll interact in a certain way and there'll be certain things that I will presume I can do that I wouldn't dream of doing to someone, uh, with someone I thought was my superior. Now, if you're been in the military like Gem and me and a few others, uh, you know, you're, you're very familiar with this type of hierarchy, but it ital it's important that we recognize even in here, in North America, this type of system is operative.

It's an important part of our lives. And, and when it's gracefully done, we don't even notice it. Um, um, and when it's ungraceful done, we very much notice it and we can take offense. Uh, but as I said, the important points are here in this, in, in Jesus' time, is that this system of honor determined who you could speak to.

Was it even appropriate for you? To speak. So in Jesus's time, it was completely inappropriate for a man to address a, uh, a woman to address a man until the man initiated the con the, the [00:41:00] conversation. You don't address someone who is senior to you in the social rating until they address you. And there's certain types of things, certain types of transactions that that must never happen between, uh, two people that are in different social stations.

And so, uh, if, if this seems like this is very much ancient stuff, I, I, I wanna remind you, if you go back and a little read a little bit of, of a recent American history, you'll see, uh, you know, women being arrested for, uh, uh, who are, who are, who are African American descent, uh, being arrested for the offense of speaking to, uh, a, a white, uh, deputy sheriff.

Or you'll see I. Um, African American men being arrested for looking, uh, inappropriately to a white man. And so these are not just ancient traditions. They're very much a part of our society. We're trying to recover from them. Um, now we have some other [00:42:00] contemporary systems like that. So, so for some of you, I grew up like I did.

You were taught, uh, one of you have an automatic deference, sort of like Maggie and Sadie? Uh, you know, for me, I, I wouldn't dream of, of speaking to someone older than me when I was a kid, and even as a, as a, as an adult in my twenties and thirties without calling, uh, an older male sir. And without calling an older woman, man, I still do that, uh, naturally, particularly when I go back home.

Uh, and, and then, uh, and, and then there was also usually a, a, an honor I would normally, uh, you know, refer to them as, you know, aunt Betty, you know, uncle Jim. I would have some sort of preference that indicated my acknowledgement of their station and some kind of acknowledgement of my. Relative humility.

Um, one of the things that I've learned to love in being married to Sina is, is the millennium language. Uh, it has this type of graceful ordering in it that is, [00:43:00] that far exceeds anything I've ever seen in, in the United States. Uh, we are a, a a a blended family. And, and, uh, so we, so, so we have, uh, uh, bonus children and bonused siblings.

And so, uh, you, I showed you a picture of Emily, well son, uh, will refer to Emily as Emily Chachi. The Cheche is a suffix, uh, that names Emily as older sister. And so there we will call her Emily Chachi and they'll call Andrew. Andrew Chacha, which indicates older brother when s when, uh, Sina is talking to, uh, her eldest niece, who's a law school, school student, uh, she, she will inevitably call her Mave, which, which, which indicates, look at the precision of this, of this language, which, which means, um, brothers.

Younger sister. So there's a name. And so throughout their language there, there are are words that name the [00:44:00] particular coordinates of, of where you are located within the, within the family so that you know you have a place. And it's a very beautiful thing, uh, in, in terms of assuring children very early that they have a place and that we all have a place.

These are all terms of endearment. Um, now these things can get distorted, as I said. And part of of my upbringing was in the South, and I wanted to tell you about my friend Gary. I told you about his mother already, Gary. Is the son who was my age of Marie. I told you Marie was was like, uh, today we'd call her a nanny.

When I was growing up, we called her a maid, but she basically reared my brothers in me. 'cause my mother was at LSU all the time getting her her college degree. And uh, and so some, one of the things that, uh, Marie would do sometimes was bring her son along, uh, in the summer and, and he would play with me all day.

And so. Year after year, he and I sort of grew up together. We'd go, he'd come from his, his house all the way [00:45:00] across the tracks and he'd play with me. We'd go to, we'd go down to a, a buddy's house who had, they, they had a basketball goal in their house, and we'd play basketball and Gary and I'd play basketball together and things like that.

We just had a ball, you know, great time and, and, and when in our innocence, we, we, uh. We, we just were friends. And, uh, yet I was aware that there was a difference. 'cause Gary would, would leave with Marie, he'd go away. And I knew that, uh, when I got a little bit older, he went to a school that was unlike my school.

Uh, 'cause I saw it, it was all falling apart. The, the, the county didn't, uh, we call 'em parishes, didn't invest anything in, in McKinley High School. Uh, he didn't get the same kind of education I got. He didn't get the same type of job opportunities I got. And if you, if you're to look at Raj Chetty's data, I shared that with you a few months ago, that show his, his, uh, cluster, his neighborhood and, and what the social mobility was like for his neighborhood.

You would see that very few, a very low [00:46:00] percentage of, of the young men and women who grew up in his, his, uh, few blocks in Baton Rouge. Ever rose above the level of poverty, were able, ever able to break free of those boundaries. And yet, if you were to look at my cluster of neighborhoods, you would see the opposite extraordinary mobility.

Uh, most people getting extended graduate degrees and living in, in, uh, and being among the wealthy, you know, 1%, uh, of, of, uh, or at least having a great probability of being able to raise the 1% economically in our country. One day I had risen to that level. I was a, you know, heading up a company, a software company, making great money, and I had some garden work I needed to do.

Well, I hired my friend Gary, who had been in jail. Multiple times he needed some work. And I was astonished when I saw him because he had that look on his eye that you could see his body had been ravaged by substance abuse and such. And he, in our situation, had [00:47:00] changed. He now was working for me. And what I was surprised to see was Gary, whom I just looked at, his friend wouldn't come into my house.

He, he worked outside and he wouldn't cross the barrier. I would try to offer him some food and drink and, and is just assuming that we were old buddies. But, but he himself felt he could not do that. He, he understood that the coordinates of, of our social position were such that he was not allowed to cross that boundary no matter how, uh, willing I was to have him do it.

And the sad thing was, is that, uh, Gary didn't, uh, didn't make it into his fifties. He died uh, long ago. Um, uh, you know, in a certain extent, to a certain extent, I would say that the boundaries killed him. All of that is to say we have these contemporary, uh, systems that we need to be aware of. I wanna share with you a word from Bishop Prince, topography wise.

There were two parts to every [00:48:00] village. Now, you know, it took me a while to, to figure that out. But initially when I, when I noticed it, I was a little curious about why, because there was always a village where the higher caste people lived. And then there was the colony where the quote unquote dalis lived.

And dalis are D-A-L-I-T-S. Dalis are, um, people who were previously referred to as untouchables because of the caste hierarchy where they were so polluted that not only were they considered to be polluted in their bodies and so on, but spatially their living space was in a different topographical place.

You know? So geographically, they were in a different location, which was considered to be in that sense, not polluted because they live there. That's from our podcast, that's [00:49:00] debuting this Wednesday. Prince is, uh, over the next two episodes, he's gonna recounting his, his experience both in India and here in the United States on the, our podcast Race On the Rocks.

And as you said, as he, as he said, he talked about the cast system there and how the mere fact of, of a, of a people, particular people, at the lowest level of the social coordinates having lived there, the land itself was considered polluted. I. This is not something that's merely ancient folks. This is something that our bishop grew up with.

It's something that I have grown up with and I would imagine it's something that somehow we've all been touched by this kind of hierarchy of human value. And that's all to say, to say that's this. That's the context. And so as we, as we hear this gospel story, and we remember the prophet Isaiah, the reading that Mary Jo read of, of what it will mean when God's kingdom is established.

We see Jesus entering into our world and [00:50:00] disrupting it, and inaugurating initiating his new way of being, this new way of living called the Way of Love. He, he is now. Demonstrating and actually, uh, acting out, uh, and teaching us how we are to be participants in this kingdom. And so we have these two doublets, as I mentioned, two sets of two stories.

Uh, one, the first one happens in in Jewish terrain, the second in Gentile terrain. So we have this first, the story about Jarris. Now it says he's one of the synagogue leaders. When you think about that, if you know something about Jewish culture at the time, and now you know that the way one achieves station within Judaism is not by wealth, it's, it's, it's not a, a status in Judaism is not something that is earned through wealth.

It's earned through knowledge of Torah. So when Mark tells us that Jairus was one of the synagogue leaders, and this would be in Capernaum, he's telling us that he was at the very top of the social ladder. He was [00:51:00] among the highest status individuals in the whole community in which Jesus was working. And he saw Jesus.

And, and what's interesting, this Jewish man. Had some kind of faith. He goes to this guy he's been seeing, doing these healings. He's, he's heartbroken about the status of his daughter. He says, she's about to die, man. I, I need your help. And he, he gets in the position of discipleship. He, he kneels before him and he says, please, just please your hand on her so she can be healed.

The, the words of faith from this noble man. And so Jesus went with him. And so we, we have this wonderful story where Jesus is gonna go heal this, this daughter, but, but he gets interrupted because along the way, there are all these crowds that are jostling Jesus as, as they're just making their way to this Noble's house.

Now, I'm reminded of how this would happen to Martin Luther King as he would make his way through the crowds of Boston, the city of Boston. And then, and, and Andrew [00:52:00] Young and others are following behind them, and, and, and people are just reaching out to touch him, uh, and, and, and to, to be, to reach, to get a word of inspiration from him.

And so you can imagine this. People just crowding up on him. And, and a woman is there who's had uterine bleeding for about 12 years, uh, a dozen years of, uh, of, of something that would be unclean. There's a, a book I've read about blood. I, I, I, uh, if you, if you, if you wanna understand, uh, how blood acts is a way for us to stratify our societies, I would commend it to you.

I think it's actually called blood, but this is one of the ways that we segregate people. So to have uterine bleeding, you know, a woman was unclean every time she menstruated, you know, during that time. And a man wasn't to even touch her at all. But that's something that was just a monthly cycle. Imagine having, having a uterine bleeding for 12.

Years. And not only that, but she was among the crowd. And remember we talked about the [00:53:00] crowd. That word, that Greek word crowd doesn't literally mean a bunch of people collected in, in Mark's language. It means the people of the land. So Mark is telling us in his language that this woman had a double whammy going.

She was, she was not only. Uh, suffering from uterine ble bleeding that rendered her unclaimed. She was one of the people of the land. She was the poorest of the poor. And there she was. He was walking past, and she just, she just thinks, if only I could touch his clothes, I would be healed. And of course, that's what happens.

And of course, what's interesting is that Jesus felt this exchange of, of a godly energy, and he, he, he, he didn't know who it was who touched him. So who, who touched my clothes. And she answers. She was full of fear and trembling. She came forward and she said it was me. And he, and he uses an interesting phrase, or he calls her in the Greek word daughter.

Jesus doesn't call anyone else daughter the word in, in the, in the Bible. And, and yet he, he, to [00:54:00] this woman, this, this lowest of the low, who was, who was, uh, about the most outcast kind of woman there could be. Uh, she, he names daughter and he says, your faith has healed. You go in peace healed from your disease.

And so Jesus pauses in going to this noble man's house and he stops and he gives attention to. A woman who's at the bottom of any social hierarchy, just by being a woman, had uterine bleeding who was also poor, and at the bottom of any sort of Greco-Roman hierarchy because of her impoverishment. So while this was all happening, of course Jar's daughter died.

At least that's what the message says. Messengers come and say that Jesus, Hey dude, you headed to this guy's house. Not so, not such a big deal now, 'cause she's died in a sarcastic way. Why bother the teacher any longer? So. Jesus though, responds his, wait a minute, don't be [00:55:00] afraid. Just keep having faith. The word STOs means faith.

Keep trusting. And, and Jesus entered into this room, and we know this is going to be a big deal because he enters into this room where there will be witnesses. And it's Peter, James, and John. Uh, and, uh, this is, uh, these guys in Mark's gospel appear at, uh, at all the big moments, the where there are epiphanies, you know, at, at the transfiguration, the transfiguration mountain and elsewhere.

And so they go into this room and they enter into this house. And, and, uh, and Jesus pronounces, uh, this child isn't dead. She's only sleeping. And of course, the folks scorn Jesus's word, they, they speak derisively is what the, the Greek says. And, and Jesus simply went to her, took her hand, says some Aramaic words, says young woman arise.

And suddenly she got up and walked. He raised her from the dead, something that [00:56:00] only God was capable of doing. Something that you recall. The prophet Isaiah in our pro in our reading today from Isaiah said, what happens when the Messiah comes? So this is our first doublet. Let's talk a little bit about what we see.

The, one of the first things I see in this, of course, is language ought to be in good news to all of us. That, that we are healed by grace through faith. And then we see this manifest in the, in the, in the, uh, behavior of this woman who thought that if. Only he, if only I could touch his cloth. Uh, the cloth, it could, could just touch his tassels is actually, uh, the, the, the, the Greek, uh, i, I would be healed and actually, which appear in, in Matthew, in, in Luke's accounts, the tassels.

Uh, then I would be healed. And then of course, she is healed by faith. And of course that's true of all of us. And this is the theme that's going to be developed, uh, is the word to us today. That, that when we are able to trust in the way of love, God acts through our trusting to bring us to those still [00:57:00] waters, to into that promised land.

But there's something being said that's I think, more important here, and that has to do with Jesus's actions in, in, in inaugurating this new kingdom of God. And it's a word of warning to the Jews, the Jewish leaders. You see here, something happening that is extraordinary, the leader of the synagogue.

Embraces the faith of this new kingdom. And, and, and what's being said here, I think, is that if Judaism itself this way of promise by the by, you know, by the people who are God's chosen people, if they themselves are to be delivered from these hierarchy of human values are hierarchies of human value and the suffering that those things cause, the isolation that those things cause then, then Judaism itself must embrace this new ordering of God's kingdom that is based on love and God's love alone.

And interestingly enough, uh, what we see here is that this is [00:58:00] that simple faith, this, this faith that heals is the same faith. Whether it occurs in the lowly outcast. Notice the noble person, uh, isn't cast out, isn't deemed, uh, lower. There is a preference for the poor. Here. Jesus pauses to take care of the poor first before taking care of the noble one, but the noble one is not left out.

The noble one with faith has the same faith as the, as the lowly outcast with faith and the, and the same faith delivers us all. So those are some thoughts that I have about, uh, about. The, uh, first doublet that we see. And one other thing I just wanna mention is that we're seeing some prefiguring in these two sets of stories that are gonna take place in the second half of Mark's gospel We're going to see.

And, and that is, we see here the, this, this, uh, prefigured theme of the last shall First we're going to see in future stories, the, the disciples themselves asking, what's you on of us is gonna be the first in the kingdom of heaven. And we already see this acting out in Mark's [00:59:00] portrait of Jesus's very clear teaching that the last, the most humble shall be first.

So then we, we have this very interesting situation where now Mark is, is, is put, putting, putting a different, on a different spot of his canvas. He takes stories that are very similar and he paints them as well. But this time, the, the, the geolocation is different. They're no longer within, uh, gile or Jerusalem.

They're now out in. Two very disparate locations that, uh, uh, you know, that are beyond the, the promised land. In the first case, uh, you know, si Fi woman, this, this, this, the story of the si ian woman happens up there close to Syria. So. As much as 90 miles away from Galilee. We don't know why Jesus was there.

We just know he was there. And the second story happens in the place that says Named Tire, which is, is way down south on the other side, uh, near the De COPIs, where, where we had the last week's story of the [01:00:00] Garris Sea and, uh, Damac. Now Jesus is in that area, so very much gentile land in both cases. And, and so Jesus is entering into these things and it's important that mark, for Mark that we notice that.

And again, now we have this story once again, a woman, uh, with a daughter in this case, uh, it's not, uh, uterine bleeding, but it's an unclean spirit in her. And, uh, and, and, and, and this woman comes and falls again at Jesus's feet in the posture of discipleship, in the posture of one who is trusting in what he might be able to do.

Um. And she begged Jesus to do what she had heard that he had done elsewhere, to exercise his, her daughter of this, of this demon who has possessed her life. And he says something that's really difficult for us to hear. He, he, uh, used the ate that was, uh, uh, commonly used, uh, by the Jews to describe, uh, their enemies to the north, uh, these cyro, [01:01:00] Venetians.

And, and, uh, and, and she, and he says, Hey. Children have to be fed first, meaning the Jews, the the Jews to whom he was sent. That's where my priorities, they need to be fed first. It's not right to take the children's bread, this word that I deliver, the bread, you know, the word and the bread are the same.

It's not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs. In other words, these kenan night cousins. Uh, and what's really interesting here is that, uh, she respond. Now think about the crossing of boundaries here. You know, all of these have crossed boundaries. The noble one crossed a boundary and bowing before someone of lesser station, Jesus, the, the, uh, the, the woman with uterine bleeding, um, you know, you know, makes an astonishing breach of etiquette in speaking to Jesus and actually touching him, making him unclean, crossing those boundaries.

Here I. This gentile woman [01:02:00] knowing that it's completely inappropriate for him to touch her or even have any sort of communion with her to speak to her, argues back and she said, Hey, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs, which was a, a common proverb, we think, uh, of that time. And, uh, and, and Jesus takes it.

Jesus says, good answer. He doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't say, why are you speaking to me? He, he accepts her correction and says, go on home. The demon is already left her. And that's what she found when she went home, that her child was laying on the bed and the demon that possessed her was no more. So that was the, the, the third of our stories.

And, and then, and then Jesus goes down to tire. And then we have this interesting story where, uh, folks, uh, from this, these gentiles brought Jesus a man who, uh, who was both deaf and whose speech was [01:03:00] unintelligible. So this was a man who would've been deaf and, and most of, uh, he, he had born, been born able to hear, had lost his hearing, but had learned how to speak.

But his speech was garbled and unintelligible. And so they begged Jesus to heal him. One of the things that's interesting is Jesus did, again, something that is unclean, uh, by. All the etiquette, all the, the boundaries. Uh, one of the things you never do is take saliva to take your own saliva and, and putting it, been put it on another person, uh, is of the same, uh, rank in terms of cleanliness as taking excrement in putting it on another person.

But Jesus takes this saliva and he touched the other man's tongue. He says these words, these aren't magical words. He's just looking up to heaven and, and, uh, and says, open up. And instantly the man, uh, once again was healed. So we have the second doublet here. What are we to make of it? I just want to, uh, offer a few thoughts on this.

The [01:04:00] first thing that I think we must not miss is that Jesus humbles himself. We've heard that before, haven't we? In Mark's gospel again and again, we see this one who descends. Uh, eventually he is going to un undo his robe and kneel before each of us to wash our feet. So in front of this Syrophoenician woman, he allows himself to be, to accept the rank of the lesser one, in the sense of being corrected by one who according to the boundaries of the world, must not ever correct, uh, you know, a Jewish man.

And so he accepted her and by accepting her, engaging her in commun, and he accepted her and, and acknowledged her as one of this new kingdom community. And, and secondly, I think we see here again another prefiguring. This is a story not just about a sro Venetian woman. Ne you know, it, it is also a, a story to the Jews themselves, who just as Jesus, who is Israel, uh, personified here, as [01:05:00] Paul would later say, just as he allowed him himself to be shamed so that the Gentile woman would be brought into this new kingdom.

So to the Jews will need to allow themselves, who need to accept God's calling of themselves to be least. In order to embrace all of the Gentile world and all in order to, to have their house be a house of worship for all the nations is, which was their original calling, always, but they need, we will need to humble themselves.

And so the Jews will in fact need to do that in order to bring about the community. And then we see this interesting prefiguring as well where we hear this phrase here that, you know, the people exclaim when they see this. And they say, this man, he makes even the deaf here, he makes even the non-speaking speak, which is a real interesting thing to think and say when you're, you know, we're talking about these gentiles, these gentiles whom Jesus [01:06:00] didn't know.

He's able to make them hear his word and respond and to experience his salvation. But yet what we see, and we'll begin to continue to see as as as we go out throughout Mark's gospel, mark is gonna show us, it's US disciples who have the problem hearing. Jesus again, again, is gonna say, are you deaf? Did you not see what I, I, I I just did, did you not hear what I just said?

So, Jesus is able to deliver, deliver, and, and enable the gentiles to hear, but his own disciples, disciples struggle. So that's the good news folks. I believe in this third Sunday after Pentecost, and it's this story, this wonderful story that in this new kingdom, along this way of love, when God rules in our heart, well that disrupts our dynamics.

It disrupt d disrupts all of our needs for status and, and our own, our needs for honor, we are, when we, when the Kingdom of God rules in us, the word we hear is that our Holy Father loves us. We are secure. [01:07:00] That's our place, our location is well known. We don't need a map to it. We are God's beloved. And so whatever the world says about us.

Is is really not relevant in, in terms of our knowing what our status is. Our true status is our true address is beloved. And so when that is true, that completely disrupts all of our h hierarchies of human value. And it should, it should enable us to be like Jesus in making way for the outcast American, the outcast alien, those who want to come into our borders and those who are within our borders, who our society tells us are somehow less than we.

And it also, I think it reminds us that order is a gift. Yes. But order isn't something we, it's a gift that we need to treat very, very carefully. All our ways of, of, of providing gentle ordering. That's what God intends. But as soon as we allow those things to harden into things where they become [01:08:00] hard boundaries, and we take offense when those boundaries are crossed, well the moment we take offense at those boundaries being crossed, we know.

We're no longer acting and responding the way Jesus Himself did. And so we learn how to act and be the image of God. We're called to be by seeing Jesus' examples in these stories, and that's the good news. The name of the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Amen.
