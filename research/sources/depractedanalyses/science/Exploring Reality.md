### Highlights

- The opening chapter is a very brief explanation of how natural the task of exploring reality is for someone whose intellectual formation has been in the sciences, notwithstanding the raised eyebrows of some postmodernist colleagues about any notion of access to the way things actually are. I nail my colours to the mast and assert my belief in critical realism. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0015MVMB8&location=38))

- Chapter 2 surveys current understanding of the causal structure of the world. It centres on two main themes. One is that scientifically our knowledge is still pretty patchy, excellent within certain well-defined domains but often unable to make satisfactory connections between different domains.

- The second theme is that matters of causality, though certainly influenced by scientific discoveries, are not finally settled by science alone. Ultimate conclusions have to rest on the foundation of a metaphysical decision. Quantum theory, and chaos theory, and the issue of the relationship between them, all provide illustrative examples of this fact. This is the chapter that will make the greatest demands on the reader without much of a scientific background, but I have tried not to use ideas without offering a non-technical explanation of them. I believe that it is worth putting in some effort to be able to appreciate how the scientific account of causal structure, though deeply insightful, is still far from being complete.

- Much of the tone of contemporary sceptical discourse was already set by those nineteenth-century Masters of Suspicion, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. The former once referred to truths as illusions that we have forgotten are illusions, and the latter, through his work in human psychology, suggested that the actual motivations for our beliefs often lie hidden in unconscious depths, so that they are frequently quite different from those which our conscious egos propose to us. Of course, each of these thinkers implicitly exempted their own ideas from subversion along the lines of their particularcritiques, as also did Karl Marx in relation to the influence of economic factors and social class.

- Science has not been exempt from this assault on the possibility of rationally conclusive discourse. Its findings are held simply to be the products of the communities that propose them; its theorisings are supposed to be more about the exercise of power than about the attainment of veracity. For the extreme postmodernist, there are not really quarks and gluons as the constituents of matter, but the idea of them is a construct of the invisible college of physicists, who have simply colluded in seeing the world in a quarklike way.
