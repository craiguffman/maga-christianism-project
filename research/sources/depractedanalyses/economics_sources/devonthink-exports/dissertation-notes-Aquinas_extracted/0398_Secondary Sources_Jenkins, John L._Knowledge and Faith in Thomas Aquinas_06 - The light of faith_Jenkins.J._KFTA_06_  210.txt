What then is Aquinas's account of the justification for the assent of faith? Several prominent contemporary philosophers of religion have endorsed a certain line of interpretation of Aquinas on this issue, which I will call the naturalist interpretation (and abbreviate .NI). 1 4 The NI holds that Aquinas thought that, at least in the case of some persons, the individual assents to the articles of the Christian Creed because he accepts a cluster of arguments from natural theology. Such a person first is convinced, by metaphysical arguments of natural or philosophical theology, that God exists. Subsequently he believes on the basis of testimony and other evidence that there were miracles and signs in Biblical times and in the history of the Church. From these beliefs he is led to the conclusion that God has made revelations in history, and that the essence of these revelations is contained in the Christian Creed as this is defined by the Church. Thus the individual assents to the articles of the Creed because he accepts, first, proofs of philosophical theology which purport to show that God exists, and second, arguments from testimony of miracles and signs from Scripture and the history of the Church that what the Church claims to have been God's revelation is in fact such, and hence is to be believed.Read more at location 2242
