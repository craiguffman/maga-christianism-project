3. metadata.json - Complete metadata for all notes
4. index.md - A navigable master index of all notes
5. Figure-specific indexes in each figure's directory

## Using These Files

### For Your Book Research with AI Assistants:
- Go to the directory of the key figure you're researching
- Upload the summary file(s) to AI assistants for comprehensive analysis
- For more focused discussions, upload specific individual notes

### Working with AI Assistants:
- Summary files are sized to fit within AI context windows
- If a figure has multiple summary parts, upload them sequentially
- The included paths and hierarchical information help maintain context

### Future Tana Integration:
- The metadata.json file contains all hierarchical information needed for a Tana import
- Each note includes its original path, creation date, and modification date
- Figure assignments can be used to organize notes in Tana workspaces
