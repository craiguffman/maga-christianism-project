The third and final comment I want to make about the PA concerns its clearly foundationalist picture of the justification for scientia and its relationship to skepticism. Foundationalism is a certain view about the ways one's beliefs are justified or have some positive epistemic status, such as being known, or (in the case of the PA) being scientia. According to a foundationalist account, some beliefs - the foundations - are justified of themselves and not because of their relationship to other beliefs; whereas other, non-foundational beliefs are justified by their relationship with other beliefs and ultimately owe their justification to foundational beliefs. The PA account of scientia is clearly foundational, for demonstrations productive of scientia proceed from principles which are not themselves known through demonstration, and we have scientia of other truths by way of demonstrations which employ these indemonstrable principles as premises.
