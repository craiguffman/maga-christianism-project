It has already been suggested that this thematic of touching provides some sort of natural ontological ground for the event of ontological reversal which follows for Aquinas from the Incarnation, whereby our senses must now educate our understanding. If 'touch' seems to hold the balance between mind and body, then sacramental touching anno domini seems to shift the balance towards body. But how can there be revision even of finite ontological order? For it reflects an order that eternally pertains between finite and infinite; and part of this order (at least we assume) is the priority of mind over body. However, if intellect knows through touching, and the ratio of mind to body consists in the medium of touch, then we have seen that touch, more than other sensing, is an interactive event (and not a passive registering). Hence the priority of touch discloses the relation of mind and body to have the character of event, and events are revisable. Here ontology itself expects self-revision.Read more at location 2198
