All the above considerations concerning touch, and finite ontological revision on the basis of touch, remain, however, incomprehensible, unless we can understand how this revision affects the relation of finitude to the infinite. The latter cannot alter, and any relation of the finite to it, must appropriately reflect this binding character. Therefore, one must assume that the ontological revision of the finite which establishes the hypostatic union, since it establishes thereby a higher finite reality, discloses something new about God, hitherto unknown to us. Likewise, since the hypostatic union entails the further ontological revision which is the exalting of the sensory and further exhibition of the priority of touch (in such a way that one can, for Aquinas, even say of the finite human nature in Christ, by virtue of the one esse, that 'it creates'), we must assume that this exalting and exhibition also discloses something new about God. Since the way to divine truth is now somewhat different, some new character of truth in God must thereby be shown.Read more at location 2232
