One could object here that the exalting of the sensory is merely a pedagogic means to restore the ideal order which is the rule of mind over body lost by the fall. However, this instrumentalist view of the sacraments suffers the same objection as an instrumentalist view of the Incarnation. In the latter case, for Aquinas, Christ became incarnate to redeem us, but this incarnation is a reality which eternally persists beyond our redemption, and in ontological dignity exceeds it. Likewise, if the body of the Incarnate God resides in bread and wine in order to feed us spiritually, this residing is eternally true—since bread and wine are not accidents of God, as nothing can be, and therefore they also are events which can never depart from him. Again, this residing exceeds in ontological dignity its occasion, and reserving of the Eucharistic elements, or the Corpus Christi processions which Aquinas helped to promote, appropriately express this. (One should note here also that we can be redeemed only by what is more than necessary for our redemption: that is, God and his presence.) So just as 'Our Lady is now Heaven's Queen', so also the humanly sensory is forever exalted in its inexhaustible depth above the human intelligence (although for the human intelligence). In consequence, since all that comes to pass participates in God whose truth it displays, and never expresses any arbitrary whim, this exaltation, like the hypostatic union, must disclose some hitherto unexpected dimension of the divine truth.Read more at location 2240
