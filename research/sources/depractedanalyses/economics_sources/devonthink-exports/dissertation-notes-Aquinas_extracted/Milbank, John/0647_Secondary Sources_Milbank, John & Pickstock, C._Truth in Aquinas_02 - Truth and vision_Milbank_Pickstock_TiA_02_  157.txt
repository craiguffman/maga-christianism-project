Thus analogy presupposes not just a metaphysics of participation, but also a phenomenology of participation, although this is not to say that the latter founds the former.115 This is not the case, because there is, for Aquinas, no indefeasible original intuition of participated esse outside a (discursively mediated) judgement that this is the case, expressed within an entire conceptual and linguistic apparatus handed down to us from tradition. Thus for him, as for Augustine, the 'vision' of Peter approaching from the distance, will be initially also a received report of his approaching, the witness of others which conceptually frames our expectations of what we will come to see. For us, intuition is never prior to judgement supplemented by argument, which is preformed by language and tradition; there is no 'raw experience'.116 Indeed, to ignore the non-visual dimension of oral report, historicity and judgement which fractures and yet essentially informs vision, is to reduce vision to a post-Ramist and Cartesian art of precise survey, which overlooks the truth that we only cognitively see in the light of an unseeable intellectual sun—all those obscure yet essential 'assumptions' which alone clarify everything else. For this problematic lacuna of darkness within the visible itself—which, nonetheless, for all creatures constitutes the visible—discursivity must seek to substitute, by rendering itself the means of showing the unshowable which illuminates.Read more at location 1346   • Delete this highlight Note: This is precisely the point I am making about Hooker's anti-Ramism
