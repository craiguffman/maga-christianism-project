What is required at this second stage is what Burnyeat has called "intellectual habituation." 110 We must undergo a process of familiarization with the principles so that they become the foundation of our thinking and reasoning within a certain area. Not only must we construct a propter quid syllogism within a particular field, but such syllogisms must come to express the way we think about facts described. And this requires that what is better known by nature comes to be better known to us. It requires that, in some sense, our doxastic structure comes to mirror the causal structure of the world. This is what Aristotle (or at least Aristotle as Aquinas understands him) is speaking of in the Metaphysics when he describes the end or goal of inquiry: All men begin, as we said, by wondering whether [things] are as the [apparent] automatism of marvelous occurrences [is] to those who do not yet see the cause; or changes in the course of the sun [which turns toward the south in the summer solstice, and toward the north in the winter solstice], or the incommensurability of the diagonal [of a square with its side]. For it seems marvelous to all if something were not measured by numbers. But we must advance to the contrary and more worthy position, as the proverb says, and as also happens in these matters when people have learned: for nothing would surprise a geometer more than if the diagonal turned out to be commensurable. 111 Read more at location 670
