# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  641

In the remaining articles of q.62 Aquinas uses the notion of instrumental causality that he has fashioned for understanding how sacraments act in God’s giving of grace, to clarify some traditional language and to ground his theology firmly on the Bible and the patristic tradition.  Medieval theology, inspired by its reading of Augustine, held that sacrametns “contain grace” and there is a virtus in them to give grace.  There were risky claims because they could make grace seem like a product to be stored and doled out.  Aquinas goes to some metaphysical lengths in a.3 and a.4 to show that his concept of instrumental causality allows one to maintain a true understanding of grace as a divine gift, while using this kind of metaphorical language about the sacraments.  In a.5 and a.6 he clinches his theory of instrumental causality both Christologically and biblically. He argues that the instrumentality of sacraments is a prolongation of the instrumentality of Christ’s humanity.  The grace of the HS is given by God through Christ, the Word made flesh.  His humanity, joined to his divinity in hypostatic union, is an attached instrument of the divine; his sacraments are detached instruments by which the divine causality of grace, active in his humanity, reaches humans in place and time. p. 347
