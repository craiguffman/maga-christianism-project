# Wippel.J._CCA_04:  302

Aquinas distinguishes different causal orders that may ground analogical predication. Such predication may be based, first, on the fact that different secondary analogates are ordered to one and the same end, as in the example of health. Or, second, it may be based on the fact that the secondary analogates are ordered or related to one and the same agent (efficient cause). For instance, the term "medical" may be applied to a physician who possesses and works by means of the art of medicine, to another person who works without possessing this art but who has an aptitude for it, and finally, even to an instrument used in the practice of medicine, but in each case by reason of a relevant relationship to one agent, the art of medicine. Or, third, it may be that the analogical predication rests on the fact that different secondary analogates are ordered or related to one and the same subject. In this third way "being" is said of substance, quality, quantity, and other accidents. The accidents are named by "being" because they are relevantly related to - that is, inherent in - a subject: substance.21 Read more at location 1213
