### Highlights

- a strong conviction forged in the course of my research: the advance toward equality is a battle that began long ago and needs only to be continued in the twenty-first century, provided that we all participate in it and that we break with the divisions based on racial or cultural identity and on disciplines that too often prevent us from moving forward. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=65))
- Economic questions are too important to be left to a small class of specialists and managers. Citizens’ reappropriation of this knowledge is an essential stage in the transformation of power relationships. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=67))
- at least since the end of the eighteenth century there has been a historical movement toward equality. The world of the early 2020s, no matter how unjust it may seem, is more egalitarian than that of 1950 or that of 1900, which were themselves in many respects more egalitarian than those of 1850 or 1780. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=87))
- Between 1780 and 2020, we see developments tending toward greater equality of status, property, income, genders, and races within most regions and societies on the planet, and to a certain extent when we compare these societies on the global scale. If we adopt a global, multidimensional perspective on inequalities, we can see that, in several respects, this advance toward equality has also continued during the period from 1980 to 2020, which is more complex and mixed than is often thought. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=91))
- By examining how movement toward equality has actually been produced, we can learn precious lessons for our future and better understand the struggles and mobilizations that have made this movement possible, as well as the institutional structures and legal, social, fiscal, educational, and electoral systems that have allowed equality to become a lasting reality. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=99))
- I am thinking, for example, about Ken Pomeranz’s study, published in 2000, on the “great divergence” between Europe and China in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,1 probably the most important and influential book on the history of the world-economy ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=110))
- All societies have produced knowledge and analyses of real, supposed, or desirable differences in wealth between the poor and the rich, at least since The Republic and The Laws (in which Plato recommends that these differences not exceed a ratio of one to four). ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=127))
- in 2021 the World Inequality Database (WID.world) brought together the combined efforts of almost a hundred researchers concerning eighty countries on every continent, with data on the distribution of income and wealth going back, in some cases, to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and going forward as far as the first decades of the twenty-first century. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=176))
- inequality is first of all a social, historical, and political construction. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=202))
- All creations of wealth in history have issued from a collective process: they depend on the international division of labor, the use of worldwide natural resources, and the accumulation of knowledge since the beginnings of humanity. Human societies constantly invent rules and institutions in order to structure themselves and to divide up wealth and power, but always on the basis of reversible political choices. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=206))
- The second lesson is that since the end of the eighteenth century there has been a long-term movement toward equality. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=209))
- Generally speaking, the most fundamental transformations seen in the history of inegalitarian regimes involve social conflicts and large-scale political crises. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=213))
- More recently, the financial crisis of 2008 and the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic in 2020–2021 have already begun to overturn various certainties that shortly before had been considered irrefutable, certainties concerning, for example, the acceptable level of public debt or the role of central banks. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=226))
- The movement toward equality still has a long way to go, especially in a world in which the poorest, and particularly the poorest in the poorest countries, are preparing to be subjected, with increasing violence, to climatic and environmental damage caused by the richest people’s way of life. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=233))
- Although it is easy to denounce the inegalitarian or oppressive nature of established institutions and governments, it is much harder to agree on the alternative institutions that will make it possible to make real progress toward social, economic, and political equality, while at the same time respecting individual rights, including the right to be different. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=239))
- Concretely, we will see that since the end of the eighteenth century, the march toward equality has been based on the development of a number of specific institutional arrangements that have to be studied as such: equality before the law; universal suffrage and parliamentary democracy; free and obligatory education; universal health insurance; progressive taxes on income, inheritance, and property; joint management and labor law; freedom of the press; international law; and so on. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=245))
- As it currently exists almost everywhere, formal equality before the law does not exclude profound discriminations based on origins or gender; representative democracy is only one of the imperfect forms of participation in politics; inequalities of access to education and health care remain extremely intractable; progressive taxes and redistribution of wealth must be completely reconceived on the domestic and international scale; power-sharing in business enterprises is still in its infancy; control of almost all the media by a few oligarchs can hardly be considered the most complete form of a free press; the international legal system, founded on the uncontrolled circulation of capital without any social or climatic objective, is usually related to a kind of neocolonialism that benefits the wealthiest people, and so on. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=251))
- Resistance by elites is an ineluctable reality today, in a world in which transnational billionaires are richer than states, much as in the French Revolution. Such resistance can be overcome only by powerful collective mobilizations during moments of crisis and tension. Nonetheless, the idea that there is a spontaneous consensus regarding equitable and emancipatory institutions, and that breaking elites’ resistance would be sufficient to put these institutions in place, is a dangerous illusion. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=267))
- Social class, no matter how important, does not suffice to forge a theory of a just society, a theory of property, a theory of borders, of taxation, of education, of wages and salaries, or of democracy. For any particular social experience, there will always be a form of ideological indetermination, on the one hand because class is itself plural and multidimensional (status, property, income, diplomas, gender, origin, and so on), and on the other because the complexity of the questions asked does not allow us to suppose that purely material antagonisms could lead to a single conclusion regarding equitable institutions. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=273))

- Without the pressure of the Soviet Union and the international communist movement, it is not at all certain that the Western property-owning classes would have accepted Social Security and progressive income taxes, decolonization and civil rights. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=282))
- the sanctification of power relationships and the Bolsheviks’ certainty that they knew the ultimate truth concerning equitable institutions led to the totalitarian disaster we witnessed. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=284))
- The institutional arrangements put in place (a single political party, bureaucratic centralization, hegemonic state property, and a rejection of cooperative property, elections, labor unions, and so on) claimed to be more emancipatory than bourgeois or social-democratic institutions. They led to levels of oppression and imprisonment that completely discredited this regime and ultimately caused its fall, while at the same time contributing to the emergence of a new form of hypercapitalism. That is how, after being in the twentieth century the country that had entirely abolished private property, Russia became at the beginning of the twenty-first century the world capital of the oligarchs, financial opacity, and tax havens. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=285))
- we have to study the institutions set up by Chinese communism, which might prove more durable, though no less oppressive. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=291))
- It is not always easy to find a balanced position between these two points: if we overemphasize power relationships and struggles, we can be accused of yielding to Manichaeism and neglecting the question of ideas and content; conversely, by focusing attention on the ideological and programmatic weaknesses of the egalitarian coalition, we can be suspected of further weakening it, and underestimating the dominant classes’ ability to resist and their short-sighted egoism (which is, however, often patent). ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=294))
- we must also remember that human population and average income have both multiplied more than tenfold since the eighteenth century. The former has risen from about 600 million in 1700 to more than 7.5 billion in 2020 while the latter, so far as we can measure it on the basis of the imperfect historical data available to us regarding salaries and wages, production, and prices, has risen from an average purchasing power (expressed in 2020 euros) of less that 100 euros per month per inhabitant of the planet in the eighteenth century to about 1,000 euros per month per inhabitant at the beginning of the twenty-first century (see Figure ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=414))
- such an exponential growth of the population is unsustainable for the planet. If the demographic expansion of the past three centuries were to continue in the future, there would be more than 70 billion of us by 2300, and 7,000 billion by the year 3000, which seems neither plausible nor desirable. It will also be noted that this multiplication by ten of the world population between 1700 and 2020 corresponds to an average population growth of scarcely 0.8 percent per annum, though accumulated over more than three hundred years. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=435))
- if we believe the central scenario of projections from the United Nations (UN), which is at this point very uncertain, the world population may stabilize at around 11 billion humans between now and the end of the century. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=443))
- according to the available data, the global average income did reach approximately 1,000 euros per month per inhabitant at the beginning of the 2020s, but it is scarcely 100 to 200 euros a month in the poorest countries, whereas it rises above 3,000 to 4,000 euros a month in the richest countries. Within countries, whether rich or poor, inequalities remain considerable. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=453))
- no unidimensional indicator can be sufficient. It is better to resort to a multidimensional approach in order to gauge the evolution of access to concrete goods such as education, health care, food, clothing, housing, transportation, culture, and so on. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=467))
- it is crucial to account for the fact that the general increase in population, production, and incomes since the eighteenth century took place at the price of overexploiting the planet’s natural resources, and to examine the sustainability of such a process and the institutional mechanisms that would make its radical reorientation possible. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=474))
- it is greatly preferable to use the notion of national income rather than that of gross domestic product (GDP). There are two essential differences: national income is equal to the GDP (the sum of goods and services produced in a country in the course of one year) minus the depreciation of capital (that is, wear and tear on tools, machines, and furniture used in production, including, in principle, natural capital), plus or minus the net income from capital and labor collected from or paid out to the rest of the world (this set can be either positive or negative, depending on each country’s situation, but by definition these cancel each other out at the global level). ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=478))
- Although it is preferable to focus on the national income (after taking into account the consumption of natural capital and the corresponding social cost) and on the inequality of its distribution, rather than confining ourselves to the GDP and to averages, that is nonetheless not sufficient. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=491))
- The reason for this is simple: human beings need to live in harmony with nature, but they also need housing, food, clothing, and access to culture. Above all, they need justice. Unless we are capable of measuring incomes, the inequality of their distribution, and their development over time, it is hard to see how we could develop norms of justice that would allow us to concentrate our efforts on the wealthiest people and rethink the organization of the global economic system in a way acceptable to the humblest. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=521))
- Without resolute action seeking to drastically compress socioeconomic inequalities, there is no solution to the environmental and climatic crisis. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=525))
- Let us restate the point clearly: socioeconomic indicators, like the historical series presented in this work and all statistics in general, are nothing more than imperfect, temporary, and fragile constructions. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=548))
- Generally speaking, property should be conceived not as an absolute, atemporal right, but rather as a set of rights peculiar to each sociohistorical context, a kind of “bundle of rights” making it possible to characterize the scope of the powers and capacities at the disposal of the various actors and stakeholders involved in this relation, whether they own property or not, collect a salary or not, or are members of local collectives or family groups.4 ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=651))
- Examples illustrating the transformations of property law are many. Until 1848, when slavery was abolished in the French islands where it still existed, property recorded in inheritance archives included plantations and the monetary value of the enslaved people who labored there. Until the early 1960s, the wealth studied included assets held in the colonies, assets that had been accumulated in the framework of profoundly asymmetrical juridical relationships and relations of extreme political and military domination. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=669))
- the march toward equality over the past two centuries has taken the form of a profound re-equilibration of the law in favor of those who are not property owners. This transformation of property law, chiefly in the course of the second half of the nineteenth century and all through the twentieth century, has been a central stake in social and political struggles. It has contributed not only to greater socioeconomic equality, but also to greater prosperity, thanks to everyone’s increased participation in social and economic life. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=673))
- At this stage, let us simply note that property owners’ rights were on the whole far more absolute at the beginning of the nineteenth century than they are today. From that point of view, we can say that the deconcentration of property and of the power conferred by property has been even greater than what the strictly monetary view expressed in Figure 4 seems to indicate. To put it in another way, the poorest 50 percent are perhaps still as poor, in the sense that their share of total property has scarcely risen since the nineteenth century, but they are a little less at the mercy of property owners (employers or landlords, husbands or colonists) than they used to be. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=678))
- To analyze the power relations at stake in property relations, and also to better understand the evolution of the monetary distribution of property, it is indispensable to distinguish the different categories of goods that can be owned. If we set aside the ownership of other human beings through slavery, to which we shall return, we can distinguish four main categories of possession: the ownership of the means of production, housing, the state, and the rest of the world. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=685))
- The means of production include agricultural land and equipment, factories and machinery, offices and computers, shops and restaurants, salary advances and working capital, and more generally all the goods necessary to produce other goods and services. These means of production can be held directly by the farmer or business owner, or through stocks, bonds, shares in corporations or other financial securities. Or they can be held indirectly through deposits and bank accounts ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=688))
- all property relations imply specific power relations that must be analyzed as such, no matter what the forms of ownership in question may be. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=696))
- the ownership of housing involves strategies of extraction and relations of power between landlords and renters that are occasionally extremely violent and intrusive, even if they have been tamed and restricted (in part) over time. The question of access to housing and of the right to have a home involves what is most private in each of us. This is the sphere of family life and “social reproduction,” in the sense used by authors of feminist critiques. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=698))
- These authors rightly stress the fact that this sphere, which is essential for the overall functioning of the economic system (including, of course, the reproduction of the labor force and the accumulation of capital) and the deep inequalities and relations of domination that are at play in it, has often been neglected by classical Marxist analyses, to the benefit of the so-called “productive” sphere alone. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=702))
- In reality, it is indispensable to look into both the ownership of the means of production and the ownership of housing if we want to have an overarching view of the socioeconomic system and the power relations implied by property relations. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=705))
- On the whole, in terms of monetary value, housing generally represents a considerable share of private property, often about half, whereas the means of production (as measured by the monetary value of enterprises) represents approximately the other half. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=709))
- For the poorest 20 or 30 percent, the very notion of property is relatively abstract: some have only debts, whereas others have at best a few thousand euros—one or two months of salary—in liquid assets in a bank or savings account. Then the amounts gradually rise but remain very modest: the average fortune held by the poorest 50 percent is scarcely 20,000 euros (about one-tenth of the average wealth of the whole of the population, amounting to 5 percent of total wealth). ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=721))
- The median fortune, that is, wealth above which half the population is situated, is about 100,000 euros, or around half the average. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=724))
- If we examine the next 40 percent, that is, the people falling between the poorest 50 percent and the richest 10 percent, whose fortunes range approximately from 100,000 to 400,000 euros, we see that their wealth is held mainly in housing. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=725))
- Among the richest 10 percent, beyond 400,000 euros, property becomes increasingly diversified: business and especially financial assets (notably stocks) play a growing role in the hierarchy of fortunes. These assets become preponderant among the richest 1 percent (more than 1.8 million euros). ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=727))
- It will be noted that the latter own, on average, about 5 million euros, or around twenty-five times the average fortune, which explains why their share is nearly 25 percent of total wealth. That also shows us what a society would look like, quantitatively, if the richest 1 percent owned 50 or 70 percent of total property, as was the case in the past. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=729))
- We can define the disadvantaged classes as the poorest 50 percent, the middle classes as the next 40 percent, and the upper classes as the richest 10 percent. Within the latter, which are very heterogeneous, we can distinguish the wealthy classes (the least rich 9 percent) and the dominant classes (the richest 1 percent). In sum, the disadvantaged classes have very little in savings; the assets of the middle class are centered on housing; the wealthy classes distribute their assets between housing, business assets, and financial assets; the dominant classes concentrate on ownership of the means of production (business assets and especially stocks and financial securities). Terms based on classes are meaningful if they are not reified or rigidified. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=732))

- In practice, class identities are always flexible and multidimensional. They can never be reduced to the crossing of some sort of monetary threshold. Social class depends not only on the ownership of the means of production and housing, and on the extent of that ownership, but also on level of income, education, occupation, the sector of activity, age and gender, regional or foreign origin, and sometimes on ethno-religious identity, in accord with modalities that are flexible and changeable, depending on sociohistorical contexts. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=738))
- Property is always a relationship of power, and not only when it is a question of owning the means of production. In the eighteenth century, the question of the public debt—the power it confers and the different modalities of its accumulation, its repayment, or its cancellation—played a major role in triggering the French Revolution, as well as in the movement toward equality and the desacralization of property in the twentieth century. It will surely continue to play a central role in the twenty-first century. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=753))
- transnational ownership nonetheless puts into play institutional mechanisms and specific relations of domination on the juridical-political and sometimes military levels that are worth examining in themselves. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=760))
- If we now examine the development of the distribution as a whole, we see that the reduction of inequalities took place mainly to the benefit of what may be called the patrimonial middle class, that is, the 40 percent between the poorest 50 percent and the richest 10 percent ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=773))
- it was the dominant classes (the richest 1 percent) who saw their relative position collapse, whereas the share of the wealthy classes (the next 9 percent) remained almost stable throughout the twentieth century (around 30 percent of total wealth). Conversely, the share of the 40 percent between the poorest 50 percent and the richest 10 percent underwent spectacular growth: at the beginning of the twentieth century, this share was barely 13 percent of total wealth, which then tripled between 1914 and 1980, reaching almost 40 percent in the early 1980s and subsequently stabilizing at that level (though with a slight decline). ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=779))
- In sum, the middle classes today are collectively twice as rich as the dominant classes, whereas a century ago they were three times poorer. The concentration of property never ceased to be extreme, but within this general framework we nonetheless see a clear inflection. These two assertions may seem contradictory, but they are both true. This complexity of the world is part of our historical heritage. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=809))
- The idea that we have to be satisfied with current levels of inequality, or that it would be healthy for the poorest 50 percent to own hardly 5 percent of the total wealth, is not founded on any solid empirical basis. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=822))
- Generally speaking, the inequality of income is always smaller than the inequality of property. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=827))
- these orders of magnitude characterizing the inequality of income are considerably smaller than those observed for inequality of property. Above all, the general movement toward equality is more impressive in the first case than in the second ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=855))
- Specifically, I am interested in the challenges posed by the rise of “Chinese socialism,” a statist, authoritarian model that is opposed on every point to the democratic, decentralized socialism defended in this book, and that, in my opinion, is far less emancipatory. ([Location 4305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=4305))
- However, the Western powers would be wise to take it seriously. If they persist in defending an obsolete, hypercapitalist model, it is not at all certain they will succeed. The true alternative is democratic socialism, participatory and federalist, ecological and multicultural. It is the logical end of a long-term movement toward equality that has been underway since the end of the eighteenth century. To ensure that everyone can contribute to it in a decentralized way, we must develop new forms of sovereignism with a universalist vocation. ([Location 4307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=4307))
- If Western countries, or some of them, were to abandon their habitual capitalist and nationalist postures and adopt a discourse founded on democratic socialism and an exit from neocolonialism, with major steps toward fiscal justice and sharing the tax receipts of the multinationals and billionaires all over the world, that would make it possible not only to regain credibility with regard to the global South, but also to drive Chinese authoritarian socialism into a corner in matters of transparency and democracy. ([Location 4468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=4468))
- On central questions such as ecology, patriarchy, and xenophobia, the truth is that at this point none of the present regimes has any particularly convincing lesson to teach others. ([Location 4472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LMS2TTB&location=4472))
