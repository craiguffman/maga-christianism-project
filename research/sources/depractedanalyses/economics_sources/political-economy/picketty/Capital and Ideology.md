- Every human society must justify its inequalities: unless reasons for them are found, the whole political and social edifice stands in danger of collapse. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=119))

- From these discourses emerge certain economic, social, and political rules, which people then use to make sense of the ambient social structure. Out of the clash of contradictory discourses—a clash that is at once economic, social, and political—comes a dominant narrative or narratives, which bolster the existing inequality regime. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=121))
- modern inequality is said to be just because it is the result of a freely chosen process in which everyone enjoys equal access to the market and to property and automatically benefits from the wealth accumulated by the wealthiest individuals, who are also the most enterprising, deserving, and useful. Hence modern inequality is said to be diametrically opposed to the kind of inequality found in premodern societies, which was based on rigid, arbitrary, and often despotic differences of status. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=124))
- socioeconomic inequality has increased in all regions of the world since the 1980s. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=134))

- The discourse of meritocracy and entrepreneurship often seems to serve primarily as a way for the winners in today’s economy to justify any level of inequality whatsoever while peremptorily blaming the losers for lacking talent, virtue, and diligence. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=137))
- it is all too likely that the challenges of rising inequality, immigration, and climate change will precipitate a retreat into identitarian* nationalist politics based on fears of a “great replacement” of one population by another. We saw this in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, and it seems to be happening again in various parts of the world in the first decades of the twenty-first century. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=145))
- Belle Époque (1880–1914), which was belle only when compared with the explosion of violence that followed. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=148))
- inequality regime will be defined ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=154))

- a set of discourses and institutional arrangements intended to justify and structure the economic, social, and political inequalities of a given society. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=154))
- From this historical analysis one important conclusion emerges: what made economic development and human progress possible was the struggle for equality and education and not the sanctification of property, stability, or inequality.

- in part a product of history, most notably the failure of communism. But it was also the fruit of ignorance and of disciplinary division in the academy. The excesses of identity politics and fatalist resignation that plague us today are in large part consequences of that narrative’s success.

- a new universalistic egalitarian narrative, a new ideology of equality, social ownership, education, and knowledge and power sharing. This new narrative presents a more optimistic picture of human nature than did its predecessors—and not only more optimistic but also more precise and convincing because it is more firmly rooted in the lessons of global history. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=165))
- “ideology” ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=171))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- positive and constructive sense to refer to a set of a priori plausible ideas and discourses describing how society should be structured. An ideology has social, economic, and political dimensions. It is an attempt to respond to a broad set of questions concerning the desirable or ideal organization of society.

- What are these fundamental issues? ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=178))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- One is the question of what the nature of the political regime should ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=178))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- By “political regime” I mean the set of rules describing the boundaries of the community and its territory, the mechanisms of collective decision making, and the political rights of members. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=179))
- Another fundamental issue ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=182))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- the property regime, by which I mean the set of rules describing the different possible forms of ownership as well as the legal and practical procedures for regulating property relations between different social groups. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=182))
- educational regime ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=189))

- the rules governing institutions and organizations responsible for transmitting spiritual values, knowledge, and ideas, including families, churches, parents, and schools and universities) ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=189))
- tax regime ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=191))

- arrangements for providing states or regions; towns or empires; and social, religious, or other collective organizations with adequate resources). ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=191))
- To simplify, we can say that every inequality regime, every inegalitarian ideology, rests on both a theory of borders and a theory of property. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=196))

- The border question ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=197))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Every society must explain who belongs to the human political community it comprises and who does not, what territory it governs under what institutions, and how it will organize its relations with other communities within the universal human community (which, depending on the ideology involved, may or may not be explicitly acknowledged). The border question and the political regime question are of course closely linked. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=198))
- The property question ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=202))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- What is a person allowed to own? Can one person own others? Can he or she own land, buildings, firms, natural resources, knowledge, financial assets, and public debt? What practical guidelines and laws should govern relations between owners of property and nonowners? How should ownership be transmitted across generations? ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=202))
- ternary or “trifunctional” societies ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=209))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- societies divided into three functional classes—a clerical and religious class, a noble and warrior class, and a common and laboring class). ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=210))
- “inequality regime”* ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=222))

- which encompasses both the political regime and the property regime (as well as the educational and fiscal regimes) and clarifies the relation between them. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=222))
- More generally, inequality today is strongly influenced by the system of borders and national sovereignty, which determines the allocation of social and political rights. This has given rise to intractable multidimensional ideological conflicts over inequality, immigration, and national identity, conflicts that have made it very difficult to achieve majority coalitions capable of countering the rise of inequality. Specifically, ethno-religious and national cleavages often prevent people of different ethnic and national origins from coming together politically, thus strengthening the hand of the rich and contributing to the growth of inequality. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=227))
- The reason for this failure is the lack of an ideology capable of persuading disadvantaged social groups that what unites them is more important than what divides them. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=231))

- Inequality is neither economic nor technological; it is ideological and political. This is no doubt the most striking conclusion to emerge from the historical approach I take in this book. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=236))

- This approach runs counter to the common conservative argument that inequality has a basis in “nature.” It is hardly surprising that the elites of many societies, in all periods and climes, have sought to “naturalize” inequality.

- In contrast, I insist that the realm of ideas, the political-ideological sphere, is truly autonomous. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=255))

- When we look closely at what followed, we find that alternatives always existed—and always will. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=261))

- The study of these different historical pathways, as well as of the many paths not taken, is the best antidote to both the conservatism of the elite and the alibis of would-be revolutionaries who argue that nothing can be done until the conditions for revolution are ripe. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=267))
- Today, the postcommunist societies of Russia, China, and to a certain extent Eastern Europe (despite their different historical trajectories) have become hypercapitalism’s staunchest allies. This is a direct consequence of the disasters of Stalinism and Maoism and the consequent rejection of all egalitarian internationalist ambitions. So great was the communist disaster that it overshadowed even the damage done by the ideologies of slavery, colonialism, and racialism and obscured the strong ties between those ideologies and the ideologies of ownership and hypercapitalism—no mean feat. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=272))
- start with the hypothesis that every ideology, no matter how extreme it may seem in its defense of inequality, expresses a certain idea of social justice. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082DKPPP1&location=278))
- from facts are frequently characterized as ideological. Yet often it is those who claim to be purely pragmatic who are in fact most “ideological” (in the pejorative sense): their claim to be post-ideological barely conceals their disdain for evidence, historical ignorance, distorting biases, and class interests.
