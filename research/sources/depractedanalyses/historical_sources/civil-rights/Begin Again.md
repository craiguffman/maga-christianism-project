### Highlights

- It is exhausting to find oneself, over and over again, navigating a world rife with deadly assumptions about you and those who look like you, to see and read about insult and harm, death and anguish, for no other reason than because you’re black or black and poor or black and trans or…For me, the daily grind consumes. I cannot escape the news. I am drowning in it, and in all the nastiness of a country that seems, or feels, like it is going underwater.

- He saw, and felt deeply, the effects of America’s betrayal of the black freedom struggle of the mid-twentieth century: The country had refused, once again, to turn its back on racism and to reach for its better angels, and our children were paying the cost. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=172))
- As I looked out onto the ruins and thought of the election of Donald Trump and the ugliness that consumed my country, I asked myself: What do you do when you have lost faith in the place you call home? That wasn’t quite the right way to put it: I never really had faith in the United States in the strongest sense of the word. I hoped that one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change—that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?

- A moral reckoning is upon us, and we have to decide, once and for all, whether or not we will truly be a multiracial democracy. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=198))

- Some may want to take issue with my reduction of our current malaise to the problem of race. What we face goes much deeper, they might argue. But I would beg to differ. At the core of this ugly period in our history is the idea that who “we” are as a country is changing for the worse—that “we” are becoming unrecognizable to ourselves. The slogans “Make America Great Again” and “Keep America Great” amount to nostalgic longings for a time under siege by present events, and the cascading crises we face grow out of, in part, the desperate attempts to step back into a past that can never be retrieved. The willingness of so many of our fellows to toss aside any semblance of commitment to democracy—to embrace cruel and hateful policies—exposes the idea of America as an outright lie.

- Baldwin wanted Kennedy to see what was at the root of all of our troubles: that, for the most part, human beings refused to live honestly with themselves and were all too willing to hide behind the idols of race and ready to kill in order to defend them. His insight remains relevant today because the moral reckoning we face bears the markings of the original sin of the nation.

- In the full view of the wreckage of the movement, Baldwin realized he could not save white Americans. No matter how hard he tried, no matter how often he prophesied doom, the country refused to change. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=255))

- White Americans, he concluded, had to save themselves. This shift in the later work of Baldwin—what the writer Michael Thelwell described to me as “the shift in Baldwin’s we”—disturbed and unsettled those who had previously celebrated his genius. For the white liberals who embraced him, Baldwin had succumbed to pessimism and turned his back on his artistic vision. He had, in effect, given up on them and embraced the prattle of Black Power. What many of his critics, then and today, fail to realize is that Baldwin never gave up on the possibility that all of us could be better. I found that insight in the rubble. Baldwin never relinquished the idea of the New or Heavenly Jerusalem found in the book of Ezekiel and the book of Revelation, where, for him, the idols of race and the shackles of obsolete categories that bound us to the ground were no more. We still needed to fight for that. But we would do so without the burden of having to save white people first. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=257))

- The promise of the election of the first black president had been met with white fear and rage and with the election of Donald Trump. The courage of young people in the Black Lives Matter movement as they protested police violence confronted the cynicism of large swaths of the nation. Dashed hopes and broken lives characterize our moment too. Ours, like the moments after the Civil War and Reconstruction and after the civil rights movement, requires a different kind of thinking, a different kind of resiliency, or else we succumb to madness or resignation.

- Jimmy’s essays demanded a kind of honesty with yourself, without sentimentality, before you could pass judgment on the world as it is. Lies, he maintained, gave birth to more lies. He insisted that we see the connection between the disaster of our interior lives and the mess of a country that believed, for some odd reason, that if you were white you mattered more than others. What we made of ourselves in our most private moments, we made of the country. The two were inextricably related, because the country itself reflected those intimate terrors that moved us about.

- Despite their relative youth, they had already confronted the brutality of the South in an effort to desegregate lunch counters and to register black people to vote. Many had been beaten and chased down dusty roads in Mississippi and Alabama by the Klan and by white sheriffs. These students were the shock troops of the civil rights movement, and many suffered from the trauma induced by a region and a country reluctant to change.

- “It is, alas, the truth that to be an American writer today means mounting an unending attack on all that Americans believe themselves to hold sacred,” Baldwin wrote in 1962. “It means fighting an astute and agile guerrilla warfare with that American complacency which so inadequately masks the American panic.” In this sense, Baldwin’s view of the writer was a decidedly moral one. The writer puts aside America’s myths and legends and forces a kind of confrontation with the society as it is, becoming a disturber of the peace in doing so.

- The idea of facing the lie was always at the heart of Jimmy’s witness, because he thought that it, as opposed to our claim to the shining city on a hill, was what made America truly exceptional. The lie is more properly several sets of lies with a single purpose. If what I have called the “value gap” is the idea that in America white lives have always mattered more than the lives of others, then the lie is a broad and powerful architecture of false assumptions by which the value gap is maintained. These are the narrative assumptions that support the everyday order of American life, which means we breathe them like air. We count them as truths. We absorb them into our character.

- According to these lies, black people are essentially inferior, less human than white people, and therefore deserving of their particular station in American life. We see these lies every day in the stereotypes that black people are lazy, dishonest, sexually promiscuous, prone to criminal behavior, and only seeking a handout from big government.

- Another constituent part of the lie involves lies about American history and about the trauma that America has visited throughout that history on people of color both at home and abroad. According to these lies, America is fundamentally good and innocent, its bad deeds dismissed as mistakes corrected on the way to “a more perfect union.” The United States has always been shadowed by practices that contradict our most cherished principles.

- But the lie’s most pernicious effect when it comes to our history is to malform events to fit the story whenever America’s innocence is threatened by reality.

- Taken as a whole, then, the lie is the mechanism that allows, and has always allowed, America to avoid facing the truth about its unjust treatment of black people and how it deforms the soul of the country.

- The people who settled the country had a fatal flaw. They could recognize a man when they saw one. They knew he wasn’t…anything else but a man; but since they were Christian, and since they had already decided that they came here to establish a free country, the only way to justify the role this chattel was playing in one’s life was to say that he was not a man. For if he wasn’t, then no crime had been committed. That lie is the basis of our present trouble. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=428))

- The phrase refers, at once, to the disruption and the splintering of old ways of living and the making of a new community after the fall.

We saw this in the tremendous response to the murder of Trayvon Martin, in the formation of Black Lives Matter, in the return of the phrase “white supremacy” to the lips of people of all colors to describe the arrangements of American life. Decades of pent-up energy were released into the streets, massed into protests. Civil disobedience found renewed appeal, as protesters tried to make plain to the nation the truth of the value gap.

- What might an honest reckoning with the country look like now? How do we muster the courage to keep fighting in the face of abject moral failure? To not abdicate our responsibility to fight for our children and for democracy itself? Baldwin’s later writings are saturated with these questions. He sought to answer them while grappling with his own trauma, grief, and profound disillusionment with the moral state of the country and in the people who repeatedly choose the safety of being white over a more just society.

- In each instance the country chose to remain exactly what it was: a racist nation that claimed to be democratic.

- We should resist the language of backlash, not merely because it is inaccurate, but because it wrongly concedes the frame of the question. The term describes a political response to a problem that cuts much deeper than politics, suggesting that white people believe they have gone far enough in addressing black people’s demands; it mistakes the substance of those demands for the underlying fears that have produced the politics and laws to begin with. As I wrote in my book Democracy in Black, even good laws are distorted by the persistence of the value gap, meaning that changes in laws, no matter how necessary, will never be sufficient to produce a healthier society. Only addressing the deeper fears can accomplish that. “Backlash” mistakenly views demands for fundamental dignity as demands for privileges, and, worse, suggests that creeping incrementalism is a legitimate pace of change when it comes to remedying the devastation of black lives.

- “Backlash” fails to capture the response to the collapse of old hierarchies as people who were once relegated to the bottom rungs of society seek to move out of their designated spots. In critical moments of transition, when it seems as if old ways of living and established norms are fading, deep-seated fears emerge over loss of standing and privilege. Baldwin put it this way in the essay on Carmichael: “When a black man, whose destiny and identity have always been controlled by others, decides and states that he will control his own destiny and rejects the identity given to him by others, he is talking revolution.” That threat to the social order releases fears that further contaminate our politics.

- this same fear obtains on one level or another, to varying degrees, throughout the entire country. We would never, never allow Negroes to starve, to grow bitter, and to die in ghettos all over the country if we were not driven by some nameless fear that has nothing to do with Negroes….It is only too clear that even with the most malevolent will in the world, Negroes can never manage to achieve one-tenth of the harm which we fear. No, it has everything to do with ourselves and this is one of the reasons that for all these generations we have disguised this problem in the most incredible jargon.

- In these moments, the country reaches the edge of fundamental transformation and pulls back out of a fear that genuine democracy will mean white people will have to lose something—that they will have to give up their particular material and symbolic standing in the country. That fear, Baldwin understood, is at the heart of the moral psychology of the nation and of the white people who have it by the throat. That fear, not the demand for freedom, arrests significant change and organizes American life. We see it in the eyes of Trump supporters.

- To be sure, we have a vibrant democratic tradition and numerous examples of courageous voices who risked everything to defend its basic ideals. But these after times reveal the deep cellar of American life (that two-storied sense of the country), where the fears that move us about reside.

We have to do this for all those young people who risked everything to change the country—for those who have gone mad, who gave us their last breath, and for those who now face the temptation of accepting the world as it is as opposed to what it can be.

- Baldwin’s vision of America was bound up with the lie that resided at the country’s core. Its images could be nightmarish. Lynched bodies, with their private parts gone, swayed from poplar trees. Men and women nodded in piss-stained alleys. Children played in trash heaps. Boys were cuffed and beaten by police, for no reason other than because they were black. But more horrific than these crimes was the country’s steadfast refusal to confront the truth that made them inevitable. “I am not talking about the crime: I am talking about denying what one does. This is a much more sinister matter,” he wrote in “The White Problem.” America was more than its “ample geography” that dazzled the imagination. It was a place that denied the contradiction between its commitments to freedom and democracy and its practice of slavery and white supremacy.

- Narrating trauma fragments how we remember. We recall what we can and what we desperately need to keep ourselves together. Wounds, historical and painfully present, threaten to rend the soul, and if that happens, nothing else matters. Telling the story of trauma in fits and starts isn’t history in any formal sense. It is the way traumatic memory works: recollections caught in “the pitched battle between remembering and forgetting.” Facts bungled on behalf of much-needed truths. We try to keep our heads above water and tell ourselves a story that keeps our legs and arms moving below the surface.

At nearly every turn, the country minimizes the trauma, either by shifting blame for it onto fringe actors of the present (“These acts don’t represent who we are”), relative values of the times (“Everyone back then believed in slavery”), or, worst, back onto the traumatized (“They are responsible for themselves”). There has never been a mechanism, through something like a truth and reconciliation commission, for telling ourselves the truth about what we have done in a way that would broadly legitimate government policies to repair systemic discrimination across generations. Instead, we pine for national rituals of expiation that wash away our guilt without the need for an admission of guilt, celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day or pointing to the election of Barack Obama, and in the process doing further damage to the traumatized through a kind of historical gaslighting.

- “What is most terrible is that American white men are not prepared to believe my version of the story, to believe that it happened,” Baldwin declared. “In order to avoid believing that, they have set up in themselves a fantastic system of evasions, denials, and justifications, [a system that] is about to destroy their grasp of reality, which is another way of saying their moral sense.” The marks of Oedipus’s thongs remain, and some, like a Greek chorus, can see exactly where all of this is leading us.

Once lauded as one of the most respected men in the world, he now found himself persona non grata as the nation turned its back on his moral vision. His position on the Vietnam War led some to call him a traitor and some so-called black leaders to denounce him.

- One of the unique features of American nationalism is how closely interwoven the idea of America is with the individual identity of white people in this country. American history corroborates a particular sense of the self rooted in liberty, self-reliance, and hard work. That history validates who white Americans take themselves to be, and the lives they lead, in turn, validate the specialness of America itself and its mission to the world. Emerson put the point baldly in his journals: “My estimate of America,” like my “estimate of my mental means and resources, is all or nothing.” To say then that the idea of white America is irredeemable is the equivalent of removing the stone that keeps our sense of ourselves in place. Without the idea, the whole house comes tumbling down. But if we don’t rid ourselves of the idea of white America, we seal our fate.

- Moreover, the refusal itself, at least from the vantage point of those disaffected with Dr. King’s philosophy of nonviolence, revealed that moral appeals did little to transform the circumstances of black people’s lives, since white Americans did not seem to view the issue of race in moral terms. In fact, white people seemed to give less than a damn about the sinfulness of racism. Power was at the heart of the matter, the Panthers maintained, and power should be pursued, morality be damned. Who controlled government, who controlled the economy, who controlled and dictated the prospects of our futures—that was all that mattered.

- “Color,” as he wrote in 1963, “is not a human or personal reality; it is a political reality.” Color does not say, once and for all, who we are and who we will forever be, nor does it accord anyone a different moral standing because they happen to be one color as opposed to another. But, again, Baldwin is not naïve. He understands history’s hold and the politics that make it so. As he wrote in The Fire Next Time, “as long as we in the West place on color the value that we do, we make it impossible for the great unwashed to consolidate themselves according to any other principle.” It makes all the sense in the world, then, that black people would look to the fact of their blackness as a key source of solidarity and liberation.

And no amount of liberal jargon, and no amount of talk about how well and how far we have progressed, does anything to soften or to point out any solution to this dilemma.

- In Baldwin’s early formulation of the problem, the solution rested partially on the shoulders of black America. If black people were ever to break loose from the image projected onto us, we had to help white Americans put aside the false image of themselves. They had to see how they were, in fact, the niggers. In politics this would involve the redemptive power of suffering and love evidenced in Dr. King’s philosophy and the civil rights movement. In our daily lives it would entail the difficult task of love: for black people to break free from the assumptions about who they were and, in doing so, lovingly open up space for white people to see themselves otherwise.

Instead of seeing that politics as one way to make claims about unjust practices—“I am treated unjustly because I am seen this way”—and imagining solidarity and identity as growing out of the fight against those practices, we reach for something deeper, something that exists apart from history and prior to experience, that connects us to one another. What Baldwin called “mystical black bullshit!” I sometimes saw and heard, in various forms, in the Black Lives Matter movement. Appeals to identities often shut down conversation or resulted in arguments that led to deep divides that could not be bridged, or they took time to heal in a moment that didn’t seem to offer much time.

- More often than not these sorts of criticisms come from the mouths of those who fail to see how they are engaged in identity politics. They take their whiteness, their straightness, their maleness for granted. What matters—and Baldwin suffered the label of bootlicker, in part, for making this point—is that categories can shut us off from the complexity of the world and the complexity within ourselves. For Jimmy, “complexity is our only safety.” He understood that “identities are invented: an identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience. It is a long drawn-out and somewhat bewildering process.” There is nothing simple or obvious about it. Embracing one’s identity does not settle the matter at hand; it is the result of a life lived fully, not one with our heads stuck in the sand searching for that essential grain.

- The value of a human being is never indicated by the color of his skin; the value of a human being is all that I hold sacred; and I know that I do not become better by making another worse. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RFVCB11&location=1867))

- Baldwin continued to do what his vision of the artist required: He sought to bear witness to what happened, to offer a language to describe the betrayal, and, in doing so, offer us a chance to outlive it. In this sense and because of the difficulty of the times, No Name is one of his best books and, perhaps, his most important work of social criticism.
