- that there is something off about the idea that who I am reduces to what I am racially. Racial identity as a basis of common life increasingly struck me as at once too easy and too hard, too easily settled and too conceptually unwieldy. I also worried that our vaunted hopes for cross-racial solidarity rested on a mistake—a belief in distinct racial kinds—that would in the end defeat itself.

- This dominant narrative held as antiracism’s sine qua non the establishing, securing, and asserting of racial identity, its self-interpreting and self-realizing singularity. It took its cues from urbane notions of diversity and representation and specialized in wokeness and whiteness, sophisticated discourses pressed into service by ordinary processes like research agendas and institutional diversity awards.

- Identarian antiracism portrays racism as the personal and systemic denigration of racial kinds by other racial kinds, focused specifically—for better or worse—on the harm black people suffer at the hands of white people.

- As this book shows, the constructive vision along with the deconstructive tasks have the combined effect of further solidifying (even with the metaphysical agnosticism) the reality of race.

- Identarian antiracism is an approach to racism that begins and ends with racial identity, prioritizing (white) racial identity as racism’s starting point and championing (non-white) racial identity as antiracism’s end game. In the academy and beyond, identarian antiracism is the dominant approach to race and racism. Its dominance rises to the level of established doctrine. Hence, one can call it the orthodox view.

- Yet, like Richard Rothstein’s much celebrated The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America, Hyra’s book describes racism’s entanglement with housing markets without examining what such arrangements accomplish, without ever questioning what racism is for, leaving the impression that whites participate in racist systems solely for the purpose of harming black people.12 Like The Color of Law, Hyra’s identarian analysis misses what racism is—that is, what it does. Historian Destin Jenkins puts it this way: “If government was the tool by which segregation was created, who—or what—was the hand that wielded it? Curiously, The Color of Law ignores the obvious answer: capitalism. The book’s focus on law and policy shifts attention away from surplus value and patterns of extraction and exploitation, instead of focusing on these dynamics as an integral part of America’s democratic, law-making system. We might well view residential segregation as the domestic expression of the racial capitalism of the 20th century.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=543))

- “While media attention often focuses on those few places that are witnessing a transformation, there are two more potent and less mentioned storylines. The first is the persistence of chronic poverty. Three-quarters of 1970 high-poverty urban neighborhoods in the U.S. are still poor today. The second is the spread of concentrated poverty: Three times as many urban neighborhoods have poverty rates exceeding 30 percent as was true in 1970, and the number of poor people living in these neighborhoods has doubled. The result of these trends is that the poor in the nation’s metropolitan areas are increasingly segregated into neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. In 1970, 28 percent of the urban poor lived in a neighborhood with a poverty rate of 30 percent or more; by 2010, 39 percent of the urban poor lived in such high-poverty neighborhoods.” ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=562))

- At minimum, those committed to keeping racial identity on the table will need to theorize its possibilities through its political economic origins. If I am right about identarianism’s dominance within contemporary antiracism, it will be these questions about the legacy of racial identity that become for many readers a particular bone of contention.28 ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=631))

- First, American race politics constructs race in a manner that marginalizes Asian Americans. Here I refer to the racial binary (between white and black) that governs the lives of those it identifies as Asian American. The racial binary limits their existence to a racial existence: who they are reduces to who they are racially. At the same time the racial binary determines the substance of that existence: who they are reduces to who they are relative to a white/black binary. Because race is presumed to work for those identified as white and black (i.e., those who are conceptually prioritized by the binary), it is presumed to work for others.

- Racial identity misconstrues identity, and therefore persons, making of identity’s translational, provisional, and pragmatic character something essential, permanent, and ideal. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=662))

- Relying, as identarianism increasingly does, on vague concepts like “whiteness” (i.e., that which determines history without answering to it) might be rhetorically useful, but it will not in the end get us very far.

- In my approach, each racialized person counts the same, as racialized and therefore commodified. There is not in this approach some conceptually privileged racialized group (some uncommodified racial group), either on account of access to power or proximity to suffering. To be racialized just is to be commodified. As a result, this non-identarian view of persons creates space for coalitional solidarity since your belonging to a group is not made to depend on your belonging to a certain race (which will segregate you from some just as it will join you to others). Belonging instead involves shared patterns of common life by which you and others mutually discover who you are.

- Coalitional solidarity premised on racial identity turns the degree of one’s racial suffering into the basis for one’s belonging, with predictable results—only certain races count. When race (e.g., “whiteness”) serves as the common enemy around which a coalition is built, then racial identity (i.e., one’s suffering owing to one’s race) becomes the criterion for participation.

- When identity precedes liberative politics, it too often precludes it. Racial identity becomes a conversation stopper.

- According to orthodox Christian theology, creaturely existence ensues as reciprocal gift giving where each one is given to the other and all come from and return to God. The Christian gospel offers a profoundly human drama where much, though not everything, turns on the question of whether persons live into the gift-structure of creation or pursue distorted desires to the detriment of creation.

- “Conscientiously moral human beings,” social anthropologist Audrey Smedley said about the colonial context of racial slavery, “do not conventionalize such habits of thought and behavior without a rationalizing ideology.

- the Christian version of the story, persons, as part of a good creation, begin in goodness and henceforth incline toward goodness. When involved in evil, they find ways to account for their actions as less (or more) than evil. By lending exploitative behavior a veneer of respectability, racism justifies commodification.46 Notice the sequence. It is not that an initial metaphysical classification—say, about another’s human status—leads to exploitation (i.e., “Because it’s not human, I can exploit it.”). Rather, the exploitation is already underway and induces, quoting Vivek Chibber, “an endogenously generated pressure to create a justifying discourse.” ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=737))

- The exploiter wants to think well of his actions. Weaponizing folk prejudices around ethnic difference and innate constraints of biological preference, he describes those he exploits in ways that make his actions seem less like exploitation.48 As his actions take place in structures and systems that naturalize his behavior (structures and systems that, using Smedley’s term, “conventionalize” exploitation) the conditions for domination are met, joining the justifications seamlessly with the behavior, allowing the exploitation to go on without thought, and without end.

- losing track of the humanity of racists, and hence their capacity to dehumanize themselves (i.e., to close their eyes to the world).

- For Christianity, a genuinely political economy—where individual desire and communal flourishing serve one another—shares patterns of common life built into the divine economy.

- If, as I argue, racism as racial capitalism utilizes racialization to justify dominative exploitation (employing parallel dynamics of exploitation-racialization-domination and use-identity-justification described in Chapter 2), then antiracism entails two fundamental tasks: first, diminishing racialization’s ability to facilitate domination, which involves deflating identarian (racist and antiracist) modes of analysis, and, second, displacing exploitation as the basis of political economy, which involves highlighting alternative idioms by which political economy is imagined.

- The fact that identarians can only see the Delta Chinese through a “becoming white” trope demonstrates the conceptual costs of subordinating political economy to racial identity. I argue that antiracists who complain about the “white/black binary” while simultaneously entertaining becoming-white tropes involve themselves in performative contradictions since the trope is the narrative form of the binary—just as the binary is, and historically has been, the logical form of race thinking.

- Promoting or rejecting “color-blindness” often begs the same old questions, as to what one is or is not blind to, one’s color as a natural or social endowment. Unfortunately, recourse to ethnicity runs into the same sort of problem, where culture, nationality, language, and so on get racialized in ways that suggest something of a natural kind. It is possible for race to serve as one among other identifiers, each serving to contextualize the next. This just has not generally been the case in America.

- Now race must be renegotiated, and some of those negotiations take place around the question of profitable Chinese labor relative to “freedman” labor and both in relationship to white supremacy.

- If the case against racism rides on accusations of microaggressions and abstractions about whiteness, we will lose track of what is most important, and devastating, about it.68 The problem with focusing on microaggressions is not that the language claims too much (i.e., making more of microaggressions than they are) but rather that doing so claims too little, like severing the material connections between personal trauma and what Cathy Park Hong calls “the trauma of a racist capitalist system that keeps individuals in place.” ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=1630))

- Now, everything stops at microaggressions and whiteness, though without enough conviction to clarify what is being discussed. This explains why accusations of microaggressions and whiteness are often met with bewilderment, which can be as much about ignorance as evasion. Cases where bewilderment is not a function of gaslighting victims (cases where bewilderment betokens genuine ignorance) result in endless cycles of suspicion and avoidance. Indeed, the lacuna opened up by insisting that the claimed injury or white supremacy stands on its own makes the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate grievance elusive and practically irrelevant.

- Cedric J. Robinson initially used “racial capitalism” to describe a “development” and “structure of historical agency” whereby the “material force” and “social ideology” of capitalism “pursued essentially racial directions”: “The tendency of European civilization through capitalism was thus not to homogenize but to differentiate—to exaggerate regional, subcultural, and dialectical differences into ‘racial’ ones. As the Slavs became the natural slaves, the racially inferior stock for domination and exploitation during the early Middle Ages, as the Tartars came to occupy a similar position in the Italian cities of the late Middle Ages, so at the systemic interlocking of capitalism in the sixteenth century, the peoples of the Third World began to fill this expanding category of a civilization reproduced by capitalism.” ([Location 2061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=2061))
- there has been no capitalism except racialized capitalism.20 Just as capitalism has not issued without dominative exploitation, neither has it issued without racism.

- As the executors of an expansionist world system, capitalists required racism in order to police and rationalize the exploitation of workers.”21 Capitalist exploitation does not start with ready-made abstractions that first divide the world neatly—by whatever philosophical or theological schematization—between humans and nonhumans. Rather, the process of exploitation produces those distinctions. The observation that Europeans were stratified into “racial ones” for the sake of exploitation of migrant labor helped Robinson get behind the curtain of racial politics, that race was before anything else a labor distinction, so much political economic theater and its real-world consequences.

- Notice how indexing, by reducing bodily meaning to use, justifies use in terms of indexed meaning. Use, identification, and justification are put in dynamic relationship, mutually informing and mutually reinforcing: how I use a thing tells me what kind of thing it is and the kind of thing it is justifies my use of it. And on it goes in a continuous feedback loop (see Figure 2.1).39 In commodifying processes, identity is indexically determined in this way.

- No one person is capable of the commitment, just like no one person can manage and execute its processes. The commitment will be spread out and subsist at the level of culture, just like the processes will be run through a whole network of institutions. Finally, notice how these processes and commitments form a society—conforming in some cases, transforming in other cases, and deforming in yet others. Up and running, the culture can go on and on, constantly evolving processes to serve matured commitments and vice versa.43 Powered by the dynamic interplay of use, identity, and justification (which runs parallel to the aforementioned dynamic of domination, exploitation, and justification), the processes and commitments show themselves to be powerfully inveterate. To claim a racial identity or to have one claimed of you is to be submitted to seasoned processes of racial commodification, indexed racially for use and used with racist justification. This process does not begin with ontological distinctions; it produces them along a path made by innumerable prudential judgments as bodies are passed down the line of cultural signification.44 More than anything race is about convenience.

- Provoked, one will appeal to reasons that make sense of given behavior.52 More often reasons are built right into the behavior. With racial domination, because dominative behavior itself creates racial otherness, it already possesses all the reasons it will ever need. This helps explain white supremacy’s uncanny durability. It is a fanciful picture that has, as orthodox antiracism often does, humans acting out of cognitive beliefs that precede their actions. In fact, action, judgment, and perception work together toward conceptual unity.53 The explanations arrive in tandem with the actions, not separate from them.54 For antiracists things will not be so easy as programmatically searching out and correcting bad source material. The relationship between action and judgment can best be described as pragmatic, meaning that racist attitudes often arrive as deliverances of practical reason.55 ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=2200))

- Even as the political economies move on, the political arrangements leave in place inequality rife with opportunity for further exploitation. Aftermarket success works off the principle that exploitation begets exploitation (see Figure 2.2). Aftermarkets do not so much ignore systemic inequalities as take advantage of them. While still present, de jure racism—with its personal attitudes, cultural beliefs, legal sanction, and targeted discriminations—takes a backseat to the de facto racism that now drives the process. In fact, it is the absence of in-your-face de jure racism that tempts aftermarket customers to believe, given historic exclusion, that the aftermarket’s mere availability signals a new racial day.60 Yet it is precisely inclusion, along with what is included (those goods previously excluded) that springs the trap of aftermarket predation. The dynamic of use, identity, and justification again comes into play to smooth over (through implicit excuses more than explicit endorsements) an otherwise morally problematic state of affairs. Racial identification plays the role of, on the front end, signaling an opportunity and, on the back end, rationalizing its exploitation.

Soon, Southern Baptist Chinese Christianity became another part of the successful business model: “We go to the Baptist Church because that is what most of us are.

The soul/body divide mapped comfortably onto a church/state divide early-American Baptists established long ago, in part to settle the issue of slavery and in part to stake out their own lines of authority, along the way relegating political economic notions like liberty to freedom of conscience on matters of slavery.123 Situated within a climate where white supremacist attitudes had free reign and especially at a moment when (increasingly internal) questions about desegregation—often viewed as a threat to reigning political economic arrangements—loomed, the Baptist Christianity adopted by the Delta Chinese lent itself to passive endorsement, if not aggressive defense, of the racial capitalist order.

- The subtlety paid off for those adopted into it. Delta Chinese seemed hard-pressed to identify correlations between Christianity, racism, and their business model.

God blessed those who lived clean, worked hard, and took care of their families. White Baptist Christianity presented itself as a road map to financial success—never mind the thorny questions about how money got made or used.

- once antiracists accept that racism issues as a function of racial capitalism, those committed to overcoming racism will need to figure out how to contend with its political economy. The Delta Chinese and Redeemer Community Church contrastively offer an alternative political economy as one way of contending with racial capitalism. Which is to say that this book’s way of contending with racial capitalism is to remind us that we have other options. Offering alternatives serves as an intervention on racial capitalism when so much of its dominance comes from the collective belief that we have no other options.132 Seeing alternatives allows us to think otherwise: one option before us, racial capitalism, creates and utilizes race and racism to facilitate dominative exploitation. Other options imagine things differently. Together the two case studies in this book present one such option, or at least the possibility of one.

- Leaving home for university education also made returning home, as other options presented themselves, less attractive.133 Even if they wanted to return to the Delta, the grocery stores were beginning to lose ground. As supermarkets moved in, the Delta Chinese no longer claimed the monopolies they once did when it was just them servicing the food deserts.134 Most importantly, African Americans, who made up the bulk of their customers, were leaving the Delta. The growth of mechanized farming meant that white planters no longer needed their labor. Just as white elites exploited African American laborers when they needed them, so they discarded them when they did not. The remaining black communities fell further into poverty, and drugs and crime took over already fragile communities.135 The broader population plummeted as people migrated north and west seeking opportunities where they could find them, allowing some to move into the middle classes even as the hopes of others were dashed by an all too familiar reality. The same institutional dominance exercised by white elites held true everywhere. Migrants came to realize that racial capitalism’s aftermarket installations were inescapable, from the segregated food deserts of the South to the “integrated” deserts of the North to (as we will see in Part II) areas west like the Bayview/Hunters Point section of San Francisco. The Vietnam War took its toll on the remaining Delta population as young African American men were conscripted to yet a further site of the racial capitalist imperium.

- The problem with the white/black binary is that it is blind to important aspects of Delta Chinese life.

Whiteness equals white supremacy; therefore, European immigrants become white by adopting white supremacy. Whiteness entails material benefits; therefore, the material benefits white people receive are a reward for whiteness.”9 When everything becomes about racial identity, the uniqueness of the Delta Chinese disappears, reduced to paler versions of prevailing racial abstractions.

- race language began in earnest as the attempt to resolve certain labor problems. An early American economy set on extracting value from recently appropriated land would require cheap labor.15 In the American case, the appropriation of lands from indigenous peoples availed vast natural resources ripe for extraction. But the vastness of the lands would require an equally vast labor supply. The capitalist able to solve this problem had before him endless opportunities for profit. But to do so, he would need to deal with issues the production process itself created. The regimentation of land ownership already meant that the materials were his as the proprietor of land value. But what about workers, without whom the appropriated land would lay fallow? How could he own labor such as to make persons-qua-laborers property? Wage and indentured labor when cheap were profitable but not nearly as profitable as outright ownership.16 Slavery would make labor not the worker’s to sell or lease as she wished, but rather the owner’s, making the worker merely a steward of the owner’s property. Ownership would permanently separate workers and labor. This permanence could be achieved two ways: outright permanence though chattel slavery and practical permanence though manipulating the terms of indenture.17 The two together could supply owners with a perpetual supply of cheap labor. Under this arrangement, the owner’s ability to extract surplus value would be limited only by what his workers could do and the number of workers he had. He would find ways to push them to do more which in turn would allow him to procure more. ([Location 3326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVNDPJ&location=3326))

Race meant whatever labor managers (and in the case of the white working class, those they managed) said it meant. “White” and “black” were conventions of pure politics. By indexing persons accordingly, race language provided a lasting solution to early American labor problems, specifically by assigning some to the category of permanent chattel and others to temporary indenture. The genius came in relating the two designations to one another, a divide-and-conquer maneuver that proved so successful that it endures long after the political economy’s early forms gave way.

- the categories “white” and “black” designated labor types for the sake of dominative exploitation. Purveyors of this language did not start with a formal category called “race” and then fill it with respective content—for example, “white,” “black,” and “yellow.” Rather, “white”—like its opposite, “black”—named a differentiation that legitimated a practical arrangement. The ontological packaging came later in order to lend greater weight to the designations. We do not first have “race” and then “white” and “black”—with “yellow” and “brown” later thrown in. Rather, “race” is placed on top of a scheme that already assigns some white and some black, a categorical distinction jerry-rigged to a preexisting state of affairs. Race comes prepackaged with content that is binary in form. The binary is part of the basic grammar of race language. Evacuated of the white/black binary, “race” loses meaning.

- What makes this story religious is not just that it includes aspects of religion like church attendance. What makes the story religious is the political economy at the center of its analysis. My theological casting of political economy is what allows me to see the Delta Chinese as religiously salient. In the story I tell, racial capitalism elicits from its adherents nothing short of religious devotion, inculcating them through dynamic rituals of use, identity, and justification, and involving them in liturgies of domination, exploitation, and justification.34 Thematized in terms of desire, racial capitalism approximates religious structures of valuation. Racial identity serves this political economy by facilitating its rituals and liturgies. As such, it can hardly be the goal. From the perspective of my account, Loewen’s identarianism gets things backward, mistakenly judging that which serves the political economy (i.e., racial identity) more important than the political economy itself (i.e., that which grants racial identity meaning). An identarian preoccupation with racial identity drives the structuralist story Loewen tells, which, as we will see, ends up riding roughshod over the material evidence, in turn further marginalizing already marginalized people.

- Ignatiev identifies a number of factors that placed the Irish on the outside of whiteness, and cites specifically English rule, Roman Catholic religion, perceived anatomical traits, and public perception. Upon arriving in America as poor immigrants, they were, given both their history and their present circumstances, seen as less than white. Ignatiev reports that in “the early years Irish were frequently referred to as ‘[African Americans] turned inside out.’ ”38 Burdened with these associations, the Irish had to work their way into white identity through the binary logic, which they did by involving themselves institutionally and politically in antiblack violence, ostensibly in order to distance themselves from African Americans. As an example, Ignatiev references Irish “Blackbirders” who kidnapped freed African Americans and transported them to Southern plantations, distancing the Irish as far as possible from blackness.

- The cumulative effect of these difficulties leads to, in Kolchin’s estimation, the opposite of what the activist historians intend: “In viewing whiteness as an independent category, many whiteness studies authors come close to reifying it and thereby losing sight of its constructed nature; in assigning whiteness such all-encompassing power, they tend to ignore other forms of oppression, exploitation, and inequality; and in focusing so heavily on representations of whiteness, they too often ignore the lived experiences—as well as the perceptions—of those perceived as nonwhite or ‘not quite’ white” (170).

- The journal International Labor and Working-Class History dedicated a special issue to “Whiteness and the Historians’ Imagination,” which included essays from a number of historians.46 Barbara J. Fields discusses how the trope is entirely consistent with race language. She describes “whiteness” as a thimblerig which “performs a series of deft displacements, first substituting race for racism, then postulating identity as the social substance of race, and finally attributing identity to persons of European descent” (48).47 She writes, “The concept of whiteness cannot, therefore, solve what I take to be its central problem (at least as far as labor history is concerned): the source of working-class bigotry, often murderous, against persons of African descent. Indeed, as an organizing concept, whiteness leads to no conclusions that it does not begin with as assumptions. Whiteness is a racial identity; therefore, white people have a racial identity. Whiteness equals white supremacy; therefore, European immigrants become white by adopting white supremacy. Whiteness entails material benefits; therefore, the material benefits white people receive are a reward for whiteness” (52–53). Identifying the trope’s profound debts to race thinking, she notes, “Whereas exploring how European immigrants became white is all the rage, no one deems it pertinent to such exploration to ask how African and Afro-Caribbean immigrants became black. Whiteness, according to its bards, may be identity; but blackness, as their silence confirms, is identification, authoritative and external. . . . The question of Afro-immigrants’ becoming black is the only context in which that of Euro-immigrants’ becoming white makes any sense at all; though the real issue is not how immigrants became white or black, but how persons not born and bred to it, whatever their ancestry, became oriented in the American world of black and white” (51 and 52).

At the most intense reaches of community, the economy of the sharable and unsharable and the public and the private makes itself known.

As one member put it, ministry to the community is “as much a kind of time for members of the church to serve together and enjoy working with one another as it is a way to serve the community; it is a way of practicing embodied mutuality.”28 Their service to the wider BVHP community comes as an extension of that ecology of relationships.

- I take from Marxism the idea that ideology covers over baseline exploitation, and from Black Marxism capitalist ideology’s inextricably racial nature, the way racism smooths over baseline exploitation by gaslighting the oppressed, whose race is made to blame for their oppressions.

Altogether, Marxism amounts to the idea (argued ad nauseum in this book) that racism justifies dominative exploitation.

- First, the most pernicious effects of racism have little to do with personal attitudes, bigoted ideas, prejudicial discrimination, implicit bias, interpersonal microaggressions, and so on.
