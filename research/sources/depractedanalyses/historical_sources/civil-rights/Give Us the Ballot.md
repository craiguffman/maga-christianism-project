### Highlights

- The question of whether the VRA should simply provide access to the ballot, as Thernstrom believed, or police a much broader scope of the election system, which included encouraging greater representation for African-Americans and other minority groups, as Warren held, was to define the debate over voting rights in the decades after the Allen decision. Thernstrom likened the VRA to a “curfew imposed in the wake of the riot.” The riot was now over, she argued, and it was time for the federal government to stop telling states how to run their elections.

- The five conservative justices on the Roberts Court embraced Thernstrom’s critique, viewing Section 5 as an antiquated infringement on state sovereignty, treating some states differently from others on the basis of a history of voting discrimination no longer relevant in a country where a black man could be elected president.

- Four months after Congress honored Parks, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, invalidating Section 4 of the VRA, the formula that determined which states had to approve their voting changes under Section 5. As a result, no states were now subject to Section 5. The Old Confederacy had been freed from federal oversight.

- The new restrictions were subtler than those of the 1890s or 1960s, camouflaging efforts to deter voting with laws that rarely invoked race, introduced with equal fervor in North and South alike. They included requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, shutting down voter registration drives, curtailing early voting, disenfranchising ex-felons, purging the voter rolls, and mandating government-issued photo IDs to cast a ballot. These moves disproportionately targeted the “coalition of the ascendant”—young people, blacks, Hispanics, women—that propelled Obama to victory in 2008.

- The most important feature of the law eliminated literacy tests and other disenfranchising devices in states where less than 50 percent of eligible voters had registered or cast ballots in the 1964 presidential election, which covered Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Virginia, and thirty-four counties in North Carolina, along with Alaska; Apache County, Arizona; Elmore County, Idaho; and Aroostook County, Maine. This formula, though imperfect, captured the key southern states where the bulk of black voters were disenfranchised.

- Goldwater had been one of only six Republicans in the Senate to vote against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His nomination, for the first time, “publicly defined the Republican Party as anti–civil rights,” wrote Thomas and Mary Edsall in Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes on American Politics ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00S54VUDY&location=1277))

- Following the election, Goldwater conservatives took control of GOP state parties across the South, including in South Carolina, where Dent became the GOP chair. “The party of Lincoln has become the party of the white man in much of Dixie,” wrote the Los Angeles Times. The South Carolina GOP convention in March 1966 took place beneath a huge Confederate flag, with no blacks in attendance.

- Turner and other white members of the Mississippi legislature introduced legislation to abolish party primaries and require a majority vote to win, so that black candidates wouldn’t get elected if the white vote split.

- Also in 1971, in a case originating out of Canton, Mississippi, brought by the voting rights lawyer Armand Derfner, the Supreme Court ruled, 8–1, in Perkins v. Matthews that moving the location of polling places, annexing new territory to change the electoral population, or modifying how candidates were elected all fell under the purview of Section 5, further broadening the statute.

- “The Voting Rights Act … ushered in a dual revolution; not only were the names of two million blacks added to the registration rolls, but the definition of enfranchisement changed.

- As a Yale law professor in the early 1960s Bork opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “The principle of such legislation is that if I find your behavior ugly by my standards, moral or aesthetic, and if you prove stubborn about adopting my view of the situation, I am justified in having the state coerce you into more righteous paths,” he explained. “That is itself a principle of unsurpassed ugliness.

- Seventeen black members of Congress, thirteen of them from the South, were elected in 1992; all were from newly created majority-black districts. The number of Hispanic members of Congress also jumped from twelve to eighteen. It was the most diverse Congress in U.S. history. “It was transformative,” Watt said. “It was a dramatic demonstration of the power of the Voting Rights Act.

- Lawyers for North Carolina portrayed the voting law as a mere policy dispute, not a case of voting discrimination. “The fact that they prefer them, the fact that they think same-day registration, out-of-precinct provisional balloting, these things are good policy, does not mean that they are legally entitled to them,” argued Alexander Peters from the state attorney general’s office.
