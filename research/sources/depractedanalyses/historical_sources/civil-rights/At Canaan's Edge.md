### Highlights

- NONVIOLENCE is an orphan among democratic ideas. It has nearly vanished from public discourse even though the most basic element of free government—the vote—has no other meaning. Every ballot is a piece of nonviolence, signifying hard-won consent to raise politics above firepower and bloody conquest. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=89))
- During the short career of Martin Luther King, Jr., between 1954 and 1968, the nonviolent civil rights movement lifted the patriotic spirit of the United States toward our defining national purpose. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=96))
- This public trust surfaces in close elections, when it becomes more than a theoretical article of faith that the power of a great nation can turn on the last trickle of marginal voters to the polls. Without “virtue in the people,” wrote Madison, “no theoretical checks, no form of government, can render us secure.” ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=101))
- Is democracy more vulnerable to a loss of collective will or to deficiencies in popular judgment? Rulers from China and elsewhere scoff that both ideals are impossibly unstable for a long run measured in dynasties, and doubters within democracy itself push for authoritarian shelter. However, nonviolent pioneers from the civil rights era stand tall in the commitment to govern oneself and develop political bonds with strangers, rather than vice versa. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=104))
- To combat distortions in historical perception, King balanced an imperative for equal votes with the original prophetic vision of equal souls before God. He grounded one foot in patriotism, the other in ministry, and both in nonviolence. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=114))

- preacher if he set foot again in his local church. This to Haynes was basic education in a county of unspoiled beauty and feudal cruelty, where a nerve of violence ran beneath tranquil scenes of egret flocks resting among pastured Angus cattle. Across its vast seven hundred square miles, Lowndes County retained a filmy past of lynchings nearly unmatched, and Haynes tried to harmonize his scientific college methods with the survival lore of students three or four generations removed from Africa—that ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=144))

- Even the segregationist Alabama Journal called the ensuing mayhem “a nightmare of State Police stupidity and brutality,” as officers first shot out streetlights, disabled news cameras for cover, and beat reporters into the hospital or distant retreat, which compelled a New York Times correspondent to report the ensuing rampage by ear: “Negroes could be heard screaming and loud whacks rang through the square.” An officer put two bullets into the stomach of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a twenty-six-year-old pulpwood worker whose application to register for the vote had been rejected five times.

- Worse, his military experts advised that a commitment of blood and treasure could stave off immediate disaster in South Vietnam—but little more. Classified military projections stubbornly refuted the ingrained presumption that a flick of American power would prevail in backward Vietnam, and strategic plans failed to predict lasting success by warfare of any design, scale, or duration. Johnson, trapped between looming humiliation and futile war, erupted in moments of primal fury against resignation to Communist victory.

- for them to wait in the corridors and stairwells. “In the name of common sense,” Clark replied, “they will have to stay out there until their numbers are called.” The numbers, mandated by federal court, were the recent fruit of legal pounding by lawyers from the civil rights movement and the Justice Department, designed to prevent manipulation in the order of service and to discourage all-day filibusters by the registrars. Sheriff Clark improvised this day by calling out numbers for the registrar’s office in a slurred whisper, then announcing that those who missed the call forfeited their number and must go to the back of a separate line for a new one. He dueled the movement staff in logistical maneuver until King led most of the sodden crowd in retreat back to Brown Chapel. No one knew whether any new applicants would be accepted as registered voters, if so, how many, or how long it would take to find out. These were separate, uphill battles.

- Although no Negro had voted in Wilcox County since an accommodating barber* in 1901, the white minority still raised apoplectic cries from time to time.

- Racial solidarity remained a prime civic duty among local whites, resting on memories and practices that sometimes were peculiar or invisible to outsiders. No merchant in Lowndes County would sell Marlboro cigarettes or Falstaff beer, for instance, because of a report from the 1950s—unnoticed or long forgotten everywhere else—that the companies once made donations to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

- Baldwin asserted that “the American soil is full of the corpses of my ancestors” for systemic reasons deeper than hateful excess on the fringes of society. “Sheriff Clark in Selma, Alabama cannot be dismissed as a total monster,” Baldwin told the Cambridge Union Society in February. “I am sure he loves his wife and children and likes to get drunk. One has to assume that he is a man like me. But he does not know what drives him to use the club, to menace with the gun, and to use the cattle prod.” ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=869))

- Doctors and nurses worked feverishly through more than a hundred patients, bandaging heads, daubing eyes, shipping more serious cases to the only local hospital that would treat them—Good Samaritan, a Catholic mission facility run by the Edmundite Order in a Negro neighborhood. By relay of ambulance and hearse, they ferried patients there until fifty-eight of them occupied every surface, including the floor of the employee dining room, and then eight more went down a dirt road to the humble Burwell Infirmary.

- No one, including President Johnson, foresaw America’s first loss of a war, any more than the day’s tear gas victims pictured Selma as the last great thrust of a movement built on patriotic idealism. It was a turning point. The tide of confidence in equal citizenship had swelled over decades to confront segregation as well as the Nazis, and would roll forward still, but an opposing tide of resentment and disbelief rose to challenge the overall direction of American politics, contesting the language of freedom.

- James Bevel coached the crowd to sort through every proposed action for constructive purpose. “We are testifying,” he said. “Remember that. Some people have a hard time understanding nonviolence.” Bevel claimed an immense untapped power for the doctrine to break down barriers when people willing to suffer worked hard to frame questions of justice unambiguously. “If nonviolence can work in Alabama,” he declared, “it can work in South Africa.” ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=1518))

- At St. Paul’s Episcopal, Rev. Frank Mathews missed his own service because of an ulcerous stomach that was aggravated by the expected arrival of twenty aspiring worshipers from the “Berlin Wall,” led by collared clergy. When Rev. John Morris and others had provided a courtesy notice of their intention, Mathews responded by asking whether they thought it would be Christian to bring guests with measles. In his absence, the awkward debate about an appropriate analogy for multiracial worship resumed in confrontation on the church steps. Seminarian Jonathan Daniels acknowledged the frayed nerves all around as signs of genuine spiritual conflict, but theological issues were so urgent to him that he frankly expressed worry about how the leaders of St. Paul’s could hope to secure any standing within Episcopal canon law or any personal comfort from the deeper imperatives of faith.

- use the cresting tide of national support to secure four new cornerstones in American law: federal aid to education, Medicare, voting rights, and immigration reform. The fourth and least heralded bill would replace the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 among others back to the nation’s first immigration law in 1790, all heavily restricting immigrants by race or nationality to the favored “stock” of northern Europe. Johnson’s reform sought to limit newcomers by number but not by origin, which promised slowly to absorb all the world’s faces and cultures under the Constitution. Each of the bills established a landmark national commitment—to the young, the elderly, minorities, and even aspiring foreigners. Together they extended America’s distinctive horizontal bonds of popular strength, in keeping with the founding principle of equal citizenship.

- IN SELMA, nearly two hundred clergy formed at midday on Saturday for what Bishop Myers of Michigan called “somewhat of a family quarrel” among the nation’s Episcopalians. They walked one block toward St. Paul’s Church before a police blockade stopped them and Wilson Baker announced that Bishop C. C. J. Carpenter of Alabama refused permission for visiting bishops to hold Communion service at any altar within his diocese. He waved off their explanations of canon law. “Don’t talk to me,” he said. “I’m not the bishop. I’m not even an Episcopalian.” Besides, Baker added, he could not “for your own sake” let a march venture near the hostile possemen downtown.

A contagion was spreading already from the advance buzz about the first “T-Day” or “Teach Day,” which had been proposed less than two weeks earlier on the conscious model of SNCC’s Freedom Schools from the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project. The “teach-in” phenomenon instantly acquired a name from another antecedent in the movement, and would crisscross major universities even more rapidly than the sit-ins of 1960 leapt between Negro colleges. Columbia University in New York hosted a Vietnam teach-in the very next day, Wisconsin the next week. Within two months, there would be simultaneous teach-ins on more than a hundred campuses.

- What had changed toward the end of the nineteenth century, he argued, was that the fledgling Populist Party, with its potential voting alliance of “poor white masses” and Negroes, had provoked the “emerging bourbon interests” to take drastic action. “Through their control of the mass media,” said King, with a hint of conspiracy, they campaigned shrewdly and sensationally for “laws that made it a crime for Negroes and whites to come together as equals at any level.

- He improvised first to answer persistent appeals by critics and bystanders for an end to troubling agitation. He rejected their rhetorical image of prior tranquillity, saying normalcy had shrugged off brutal terror and merely frowned over bombed churches. “It is normalcy all over Alabama that prevents the Negro from becoming a registered voter,” he said. His distinctive, anguished voice heated the word “normalcy” into an improbable engine of speech momentum, fired fifteen times over ten consecutive sentences. “The only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy that allows judgment to run down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,” King shouted, transposing the prophet Amos. He rushed on from memory to make three final appeals for nonviolence in the struggle to build “a society at peace with itself,” then spoke to yearnings within. “I know you are asking today, how long will it take?” he confessed. “Somebody’s asking, how long will prejudice blind the visions….

- The Rt. Rev. Richard Emrich, Episcopal Bishop of Michigan, emphatically disapproved. He privately reproached both Myers and Sayers for attacking another bishop without his consent, and identified with the travail of Carpenter as a peer at the helm of an embattled institution. Sunday’s breakthrough at St. Paul’s had withered under siege. With Carpenter’s assistant consoling Rev. Mathews about “what a bitter pill it was to you to have to do business with John Morris,” the visiting Episcopal clergy, including Morris, returned eagerly to the church house for follow-up consultation (after resolving among themselves, in Judith Upham’s favor, a dispute about whether it was proper for a female to join negotiations over church policy). They were dismayed to learn from Mathews that many at St. Paul’s understood the mixed service as the one-time price of a bargain for their departure. On the other side, even moderates in the congregation were distressed that the visitors hoped to build continuing fellowship on the divided vote to admit Negroes. Prominent segregationists already resigned from the governing vestry. Church lawyers picked at Carpenter’s interpretation of the canon.

- Mathews reserved for his superiors the strength of internal rebellion. “Losing this family would be a terrific financial blow to the parish,” he confided to Carpenter’s assistant. “They pledge $3,000 a year, and in the past three years have put an additional $7,500 in my discretionary fund…but I’ll be damned if I’ll be bought.” He complained that the wife of another resigned vestryman, whose extended family “make up the greatest part of the congregation,” was “absolutely ‘sick’” with certainty that integrated worship was a Communist conspiracy to enslave white people. “If she is cured,” wrote Mathews, “it will be a greater healing miracle than any recorded in the Gospels.” ([Location 3455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=3455))

- PALM Sunday in Selma, the chief usher at St. Paul’s Episcopal stopped a mixed group before 7:30 morning worship. “The bishop says we’ve got to let you into our church,” he advised, “but we don’t have to let you receive Communion.” Police arrived, and a standoff ensued until Rev. Frank Mathews emerged in robes to guide the ushers down the sidewalk for an intense private discussion. White seminarians Jonathan Daniels and Judith Upham waited with half a dozen charges in question—teenage girls from their host families in the Carver Homes apartments, who had been up since dawn to plait their hair, pull on dress gloves, and practice Communion etiquette. “I may lose my job because of this,” Mathews whispered upon his return, “but you can come to the service.” With a look that signaled an uneasy compromise with his ushers, he stipulated that they must sit in the back row and receive Communion last. Inside, some members held back from Communion with transparent disgust, as though the intruders had spoiled salvation. Others made a point of welcoming the visitors afterward, while one man made conversation on the steps until he could no longer contain himself. “You goddam scum,” he said, and spelled out the word with an intensity that left Upham shaking.

- He tried to combat the popular impression that demonstrators claimed license to break laws in pursuit of “benefits exclusively for the Negro.” The civil rights movement came from a larger heritage stretching back through the suffragettes and the Boston Tea Party, he said, and had contributed new civic interactions of broad application, such as the teach-in. Distinguishing between nonviolence and classical civil disobedience, King argued that the former aimed not to defy but to fulfill the Constitution. He pictured democracy itself as a political form of nonviolence, merged and refined in history’s slow rise from primitive conquest toward the established vote.

- He communed with his Ebenezer congregation about wounds beyond reach, sketching the bleakness of people gone cold. “They are too detached to be selfish, and too lifeless to be unselfish,” he warned. “Their hands are even unresponsive to the touch of a charming baby.” He touched bottom, then cornered despair first by repeating his text from Jeremiah with special emphasis: “This is my grief, and I must bear it.” Never avoid shame or failure, he counseled, but “put it in the center of your mind and dare—stare daringly at it.” From there they could “turn this liability into an asset” by harnessing the energy of pain and reproach. “Never forget, my friends,” King told them, “almost anything that happens to us may be woven into the purposes of God.” His voice gathered rhythm and strength. As in another trademark sermon, on intractable evil, he listed treasured figures of history who bounced from suffering and penance to glory. “I’ve been to the mountaintop now,” he cried, in words he would repeat for posterity in Memphis. “God allowed me to live these years. It doesn’t matter now. Whatever happens now doesn’t matter, because I’ve seen the promised land.” ([Location 4065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=4065))

Sanders, looking instead to integrate some faculty meetings in a few years, said schools would self-destruct before letting the first Negro teacher preside over a classroom of white students. Johnson commiserated effusively. “I know what you’ve got to do, and God, I just, my heart bleeds for you,” he told Sanders, opining that every human being yearned to do right. “But wantin’ to do what’s right and doing what’s right’s two different things,” said the President, “and sometimes it’s a long hill to climb in between.” ([Location 4116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=4116))

That same night, violence struck Bogalusa, Louisiana, where the Justice Department was seeking Title I relief against six holdout restaurants that refused to serve Negroes, and where John Doar, head of the Civil Rights Division, had negotiated for police tolerance of peaceful demonstrations to integrate the city park, public library, and several businesses.

- Barriers to freedom were “tumbling down,” Johnson told the audience of five thousand at Howard University. “But freedom is not enough.” He foresaw a new and “more profound stage” of battle ahead—to seek “not just freedom but opportunity…not just equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and as a result.” To frame a visionary future, Johnson confronted the past with sweeping metaphors from warfare and sports. “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains, and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race,” declared the President, “and then say, ‘you are free to compete with all the ([Location 4166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=4166))

- Instead, Johnson already had abandoned the safer political conceits—that the burden was fading naturally, or peculiar to the South, or manageable by a piece of law—to address what he called “the much grimmer story” of human result. He said most Negroes—the near and distant kin of the achieving graduates before him—remained among the “uprooted and the dispossessed,” shut in slums, “losing ground every day,” unskilled and poorly educated. “They still are another nation,” the President declared. Although he retreated at times to impersonal statistics on unemployment and income, his images closed relentlessly on damaged, unveiled faces. “They are anguishing to observe,” he said. “For the Negro they are a constant reminder of oppression. For the white they are a constant reminder of guilt.” He charged that “long years of degradation” had broken apart Negro families “on a massive scale,” ([Location 4178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=4178))

- Like Lincoln, who quoted Psalm 19 to postulate that four years of untold carnage still might not atone for unrequited crimes,* Johnson spoke of penance and resolve. Only an accidental misreading of his text broke the spell, when he pledged to seek specific remedies at a fall conference of experts featuring “Negro leaders of both races.” Howard students chuckled over a gaffe that evoked classical DuBois on split identity as well as contemporary jokes about bourgeois Negroes trying to be white. Johnson recovered quickly to extol “the glorious opportunity of this generation to end the one huge wrong of the American nation.” Like Lincoln, he embraced freedom in biblical cadence as a builder’s quest “to dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart, which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong—great wrong—to the children of God.” ([Location 4188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000Q9J01A&location=4188))

- Far away in Bogalusa, bushwhackers struck again on the night of the Howard speech. Sheriff Dorman Crowe identified them as “half-witted white kids” incensed by news reports that a Negro would be eligible for state employee survivor’s insurance. The attorney general of Louisiana already had disqualified the widow of Deputy O’Neal Moore, ruling that he had not been murdered “while engaged in the direct apprehension of a person,” as technically required, and prosecution of Moore’s accused killer was securely stalled (the investigation to be reopened more than twenty years later, in 1989), as often occurred in such cases. Even so, said Sheriff Crowe, young attackers, egged on by their parents, shot up his white deputy’s home to deter “race traitors” in law enforcement. “These people actually believe in their hearts that the Communists would take over before twelve o’clock if it wasn’t for them,” he told reporters.
