### Highlights

- Because the United States was the presumptive leader of the free world, racism in the nation was a matter of international concern. How could American democracy be a beacon during the Cold War, and a model for those struggling against Soviet oppression, if the United States itself practiced brutal discrimination against minorities within its own borders?

- Jimmy Wilson’s case is one example of the international impact of American race discrimination during the Cold War. Domestic civil rights crises would quickly become international crises. As presidents and secretaries of state from 1946 to the mid-1960s worried about the impact of race discrimination on U.S. prestige abroad, civil rights reform came to be seen as crucial to U.S. foreign relations.

- While World War I influenced civil rights activists’ critique of American racism, it did not lead to extensive social change. The moment for broader change came after World War II, a war against a racist regime carried on by a nation with segregated military forces. During the war years the idea that a conflict inhered in American ideology and practice first gained wide currency.

- As Wendell L. Willkie put it, “Our very proclamations of what we are fighting for have rendered our own inequities self-evident. When we talk of freedom and opportunity for all nations the mocking paradoxes in our own society become so clear they can no longer be ignored.”12 ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=287))

- American might would not be determined by military strength alone. “America, for its international prestige, power, and future security, needs to demonstrate to the world that American Negroes can be satisfactorily integrated into its democracy.” ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=305))

- thinking that World War II was a war against racial and religious intolerance, and that the United States stood to gain from promoting equality at home was so widespread that Frank Sinatra even sang about it. The lesson of his short film The House I Live In was that racial and religious intolerance were “Nazi” characteristics. To be “American” was to practice equality, at least toward one’s wartime allies. This Oscar-winning film ended with Sinatra singing, “all races and religions, that’s America to me.”18 ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=320))

- The purpose of the war would leave its victors with new obligations. And if the war was, at least in part, a battle against racism, then racial segregation and disenfranchisement seemed to belie the great sacrifices the war had wrought.19 This idea was captured by a military chaplain with U.S. Marine Corps troops at the Battle of Iwo Jima during the final months of the war. When the battle was over, Rabbi Roland B. Gittelsohn stood over newly dug graves on the island and delivered a eulogy. “Here lie men who loved America,” he said. Here lie officers and men, Negroes and whites, rich and poor, together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith, or despises him because of his color. . . . Among these men there is no discrimination, no prejudice, no hatred. Theirs is the highest and purest democracy. The equality these soldiers had found in death was, for Gittelsohn, at the heart of the war’s meaning.

- As the nation closed ranks, critics of American society often found themselves labeled as “subversive.” Civil rights groups had to walk a fine line, making it clear that their reform efforts were meant to fill out the contours of American democracy, and not to challenge or undermine it. Organizations outside a narrowing sphere of civil rights politics found it difficult to survive the Cold War years.23 Under the strictures of Cold War politics, a broad, international critique of racial oppression was out of place. As Penny Von Eschen has written, the narrowed scope of acceptable protest during the early years of the Cold War would not accommodate criticism of colonialism. Western European colonial powers, after all, were America’s Cold War allies. For that reason, outspoken critics of colonialism found themselves increasingly under siege.24 ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=354))

- In spite of the repression of the Cold War era, civil rights reform was in part a product of the Cold War. In the years following World War II, racial discrimination in the United States received increasing attention from other countries. Newspapers throughout the world carried stories about discrimination against nonwhite visiting foreign dignitaries, as well as against American blacks. At a time when the United States hoped to reshape the postwar world in its own image, the international attention given to racial segregation was troublesome and embarrassing. The focus of American foreign policy was to promote democracy and to “contain” communism, but the international focus on U.S. racial problems meant that the image of American democracy was tarnished. The apparent contradictions between American political ideology and American practice led to particular foreign relations problems with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Soviet Union capitalized on this weakness, using the race issue prominently in anti-American propaganda. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=369))

- Yet the Cold War would frame and thereby limit the nation’s civil rights commitment. The primacy of anticommunism in postwar American politics and culture left a very narrow space for criticism of the status quo. By silencing certain voices and by promoting a particular vision of racial justice, the Cold War led to a narrowing of acceptable civil rights discourse. The narrow boundaries of Cold War—era civil rights politics kept discussions of broad-based social change, or a linking of race and class, off the agenda. In addition, to the extent that the nation’s commitment to social justice was motivated by a need to respond to foreign critics, civil rights reforms that made the nation look good might be sufficient. The narrow terms of Cold War civil rights discourse and the nature of the federal government’s commitment help explain the limits of social change during this period.

- In addressing civil rights reform from 1946 through the mid-1960s, the federal government engaged in a sustained effort to tell a particular story about race and American democracy: a story of progress, a story of the triumph of good over evil, a story of U.S. moral superiority. The lesson of this story was always that American democracy was a form of government that made the achievement of social justice possible, and that democratic change, however slow and gradual, was superior to dictatorial imposition. The story of race in America, used to compare democracy and communism, became an important Cold War narrative. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=386))

- The U.S. policymakers in this study, however, saw American race relations through the lens of a black/white paradigm. To them, race in America was quintessentially about “the Negro problem.” Foreign observers as well remarked that the status of “the Negro” was the paradigm for exploring race in America.

- Massive resistance to school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas, threatened to undermine the narrative of race and democracy carefully told in U.S. propaganda.

- the years following World War II, a wave of violence swept the South as African American veterans returned home. Lynchings and beatings of African Americans, sometimes involving local law enforcement officials, were covered in the media in this country and abroad. The violence spawned protests and demands that the federal government take steps to alleviate that brutality and other forms of racial injustice.

- “When a Mayor and a City Marshall can take a negro Sergeant off a bus in South Carolina, beat him up and put out one of his eyes, and nothing is done about it by the State Authorities, something is radically wrong with the system,” he wrote. “I can’t approve of such goings on and I shall never approve of it, as long as I am here . . . I am going to try to remedy it and if that ends up in my failure to be reelected, that failure will be in a good cause.”15 ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=542))

He issued executive orders desegregating the military and establishing a Fair Employment Board in the Civil Service Commission to review complaints of race discrimination in employment in the executive branch.19 ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=575))

- Apart from electoral politics and pressure from civil rights activists, the Truman administration had another reason to address domestic racism: other countries were paying attention to the problem. Newspapers in many corners of the world covered stories of racial discrimination against African Americans. When nonwhite foreign dignitaries visited the United States and encountered discrimination, it led to serious diplomatic consequences. And as tension between the United States and the Soviet Union increased in the years after the war, the Soviets made effective use of U.S. failings in this area in anti-American propaganda. Concern about the effect of U.S. race discrimination on Cold War foreign relations led the Truman administration to adopt a pro—civil rights posture as part of its international agenda to promote democracy and contain communism.

- Following World War II, anything that undermined the image of American democracy was seen as threatening world peace and aiding Soviet aspirations to dominate the world. In 1947, in an address before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned the nation of the threatening environment of the Cold War. “At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life,” he said. “The choice is too often not a free one.” Nations were divided between a way of life “distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression,” and a way of life that “relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.” The gravity of the situation made this a “fateful hour,” and it placed upon the United States a new responsibility. “The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world—and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation.”21 Truman’s speech ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=589))

- With the communist threat now perceived in global, apocalyptic terms, scrutiny of how domestic policies affected the struggle against world communism became a priority. The most direct way in which this manifested itself was the concern about communist “infiltration” in American government. On March 21, 1947, only nine days after his Truman Doctrine speech, the president signed an executive order creating a loyalty program for federal employees that required a loyalty investigation for federal employment.

- “Realizing the vulnerability of racial segregation as a social system, southerners most intent on pressing white supremacy consistently promoted the notion that only alien forces bent on social upheaval would challenge the racial status quo. Large segments of the population in the Deep South, including educated whites, accepted this explanation as the primary force behind resistance to white supremacy.” ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=616))

- While efforts to change American society during the Cold War were usually viewed as “un-American,” the NAACP cast its efforts at racial reform as part of the struggle against communism. According to NAACP executive director Roy Wilkins, “the survival of the American democratic system in the present global conflict of ideologies depends upon the strength it can muster from the minds, hearts and spiritual convictions of all its people.” He argued that “the Negro wants change in order that he may be brought in line with the American standard . . . which must be done not only to preserve and strengthen that standard here at home, but to guarantee its potency in the world struggle against dictatorship.”25 ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=620))

- Robert E. Cushman, a Cornell University professor and member of the President’s Committee on Civil Rights, explained the problem in a January 1948 New York Times magazine article. Following World War II, he argued, the nation finds itself the most powerful spokesman for the democratic way of life, as opposed to the principles of a totalitarian state. It is unpleasant to have the Russians publicize our continuing lynchings, our Jim Crow statutes and customs, our anti-Semitic discriminations and our witch-hunts; but is it undeserved? Cushman thought that Americans “cannot deny the truth of the charges; we are becoming aware that we do not practice the civil liberty we preach; and this realization is a wholesome thing.” ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=627))

- During the Truman years, in no country was the focus on American race relations of greater importance than in India. Chester Bowles discovered in 1951, early in his tenure as U.S. ambassador to India, that “the number one question” in Asia about the United States was “about America’s treatment of the Negro.” Bowles took Indian concerns very seriously because he believed India to be of great strategic importance to the United States.

- Prud’homme’s article described the history of American racial practices, including the history of the Ku Klux Klan and the denial of voting rights through poll taxes and discriminatory voter registration tests. It was a shameful story, and a contrast to the U.S. government’s efforts to present American democracy as a shining example for the world. Instead, Prud’homme suggested that U.S. treatment of African Americans “strangely resembles the story of India under British domination.” The “only bright spot in this picture” was provided by individuals like a white Baptist pastor who was committed to racial equality. But the minister told Prud’homme, “If one of us fights for true democracy and progress, he is labeled a Communist. . . . That is an effective way of shutting him up.” ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=713))

- For Senator Benton, U.S. Ambassador to India Chester Bowles, and many U.S. diplomats, race discrimination undermined the nation’s prestige abroad, threatening its Cold War leadership. If other nations, and particularly nonwhite peoples, were to have faith in democracy, the United States would need to reassure them that American democracy was not synonymous with white supremacy.

- The best-developed presentation of the government position on race appeared in The Negro in American Life, a pamphlet produced by the USIS in 1950 or 1951. This pamphlet revealed, rather than concealed, the nation’s past failings, and it did so for the purpose of presenting American history as a story of redemption. In this story, democracy as a system of government was the vehicle for national reconciliation. The telling of a shameful story became an avenue for Cold War argument. Democracy, not totalitarian forms of government, it argued, provided a context that made reconciliation and redemption possible.

- According to The Negro in American Life, the “cardinal cause” of American racial prejudice was the nation’s history of slavery. That history was presented as an unfortunate part of the American past. The reader was told that during the colonial period “enlightened men vigorously opposed the slave trade,” but “farmers and plantation owners accepted slavery as the answer to their ever growing need for cheap labor.” At this time, “use of cheap or slave labor was the way of the world.” Some had “moral qualms” about slavery, but they “could be persuaded to accept the notion that Negroes—strange men from Africa—were something less than human. And so there began in the United States a theory of racial inferiority which became a key tenet in support of slavery and, later, of economic and social discrimination.” From this theory of inequality, “a divided society was built upon the assumption of white superiority. In some places it became a serious crime to educate a Negro. To treat a Negro as an equal was heresy. The Negro who challenged his slave status did so at risk of life.” In the late eighteenth century, when the nation was formed, some American leaders were cognizant of the contradiction between slavery and American democratic ideals, but nevertheless accommodated slavery’s continued existence in order to foster national unity.7 ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=988))

- The reader was asked not to view American race relations in isolation. Rather, “it is against this background that the progress which the Negro has made and the steps still needed for the full solution of his problems must be measured.” With the shameful past as a benchmark, race relations in the early 1950s could certainly be seen as an improvement.

- While the United States hoped that, with the help of an improved information program, other countries would rally behind the flag of democracy and would perceive communism as the most important threat to world peace, many Asian and African countries did not view the conflict between the superpowers as their primary concern. According to a 1952 report on the status of U.S. propaganda efforts, “In South and Southeast Asia, anti-colonialism and associated racial resentments have been far more important elements in the psychological situation than anti-communism.” The United States attempted to shape its propaganda accordingly, finding that approaches that focused on matters of local concern were more effective in “underdeveloped” nations “where the memory or actuality of domination by the white man is a far greater psychological reality than the Soviet menace.”16 ([Location 1068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1068))

- The truth about America, as Indians saw it, was that the nation was imperialistic, and its foreign aid was a tool of imperialism. Redding’s contacts also believed that “American policy is opposed to the ‘liberation and rise’ of the colored peoples of the world, and that the treatment of Negroes in America is a home demonstration of this. The color question is linked with imperialism.” He continued, “America, the belief is, is prejudiced against non-whites and that prejudice, long documented in the disabilities under which Negroes suffer in the U.S., is now being expressed in American world policy. My Indian acquaintances contrasted the American billions given or loaned to Europe with the few millions disbursed in the East.” ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1112))

- Paul Robeson and W. E. B. DuBois, among others, found that their ability to travel overseas was curtailed in the early 1950s. Robeson through song and DuBois through political organizing generated international interest in American racial problems. As far as the U.S. government was concerned, however, the nation had enough of a foreign relations problem from international media coverage of events at home. It didn’t help matters when people went out of their way to generate foreign interest in race discrimination in the United States. Consequently, when Robeson and DuBois criticized U.S. racism abroad, the State Department confiscated their passports, effectively denying them access to an international audience.

- The State Department did not look favorably upon the Civil Rights Congress’s efforts. After Patterson submitted the petition in Paris, the U.S. embassy in Paris asked him to surrender his passport. Patterson refused, but his passport was seized when he returned to the United States. The New York Times reported that “the State Department said that further travel by Mr. Patterson would not be in the ‘best interest of the United States.’ ” Patterson had broken the unwritten rule of Cold War civil rights activism. He had aired the nation’s dirty laundry overseas. Patterson had also run afoul of other Cold War norms: he was active in a left-of-center organization, and worse, he openly associated with members of the Communist Party. The CRC itself was on the attorney general’s list of subversive organizations. The organization was under constant pressure from anti-communists in the federal government, so that eventually, according to Gerald Horne, it “seemed . . . to be in business in order to defend itself.” As with the NAACP petition, the United Nations would take no action on the Civil Rights Congress petition.40 ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1247))

- During the crisis over the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the fall of 1957, Armstrong said that “the way they are treating my people in the South, the government can go to hell.” Were he to go to the Soviet Union, and “The people over there ask me what’s wrong with my country, what am I supposed to say?” Armstrong later added, “The Government could go to the devil with its plans for a propaganda tour of Soviet Russia.” Many harshly criticized Armstrong’s angry words. In Armstrong’s FBI file for that year was an anonymous letter stating “Louis ‘Satcho’ [sic] Armstrong is a communist, why does State Dept. give him a passport?” While Armstrong’s passport was not seized, the FBI recorded the episode and continued to collect information on his activities. In the eyes of the federal government, Armstrong had spoken out of turn under the etiquette of Cold War race politics. Domestic problems were to be shielded from outside ears. And the discourse on civil rights was bounded by the terms of Cold War liberalism. Some level of liberal activism would be tolerated, but only if articulated in a way that did not challenge the democratic order. Armstrong’s offense was that he seemed unwilling to defend the nation against communist critics. Patriots were supposed to close ranks.

- The impact of race on foreign relations greatly troubled Chester Bowles as he neared the end of his first tenure as U.S. ambassador to India. Bowles stressed the importance of race to foreign relations in a 1952 speech at Yale University. A year, a month, or even a week in Asia is enough to convince any perceptive American that the colored peoples of Asia and Africa, who total two-thirds of the world’s population, seldom think about the United States without considering the limitations under which our 13 million Negroes are living. Bowles believed that most Asians and Africans were “convinced that, solely because of their color, many Americans are denied a full share in the life of the richest nation on earth, and in their ears this conviction gives our claim to world leadership a distinctly hollow ring.” Bowles asked his audience, “[C]an any of us say they are wrong?” ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1434))

- In 1947, Truman’s President’s Committee on Civil Rights issued a report that highlighted the foreign affairs consequences of race discrimination. The committee’s report, To Secure These Rights, argued that there were three reasons why civil rights abuses in the United States should be redressed: a moral reason—discrimination was morally wrong; an economic reason—discrimination harmed the economy; and an international reason—discrimination damaged U.S. foreign relations. According to the report, Our foreign policy is designed to make the United States an enormous, positive influence for peace and progress throughout the world. We have tried to let nothing, not even extreme political differences between ourselves and foreign nations, stand in the way of this goal. But our domestic civil rights shortcomings are a serious obstacle. ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1458))

- To support this argument, the committee report quoted a letter from Acting Secretary of State Dean Acheson to the chairman of the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC). According to Acheson, [T]he existence of discrimination against minority groups in this country has an adverse effect upon our relations with other countries. We are reminded over and over by some foreign newspapers and spokesmen, that our treatment of various minorities leaves much to be desired. . . . Frequently we find it next to impossible to formulate a satisfactory answer to our critics in other countries. An atmosphere of suspicion and resentment in a country over the way a minority is being treated in the United States is a formidable obstacle to the development of mutual understanding and trust between the two countries. We will have better international relations when these reasons for suspicion and resentment have been removed.

- Maintaining U.S. prestige abroad would help safeguard democracy in other lands. Our achievements in building and maintaining a state dedicated to the fundamentals of freedom have already served as a guide for those seeking the best road from chaos to liberty and prosperity. But it is not indelibly written that democracy will encompass the world. We are convinced that our way of life—the free way of life—holds a promise of hope for all people. We have what is perhaps the greatest responsibility ever placed upon a people to keep this promise alive. Only still greater achievements will do it. The consequences were stark, for the future was uncertain. The committee emphasized that “the United States is not so strong, the final triumph of the democratic ideal is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of us or our record.”5 ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1492))

- Truman’s relations with Congress were sufficiently strained that he did not have great success with any of his domestic legislative proposals. On civil rights, his prospects were particularly bleak because of the hold of Southern Democrats on key Senate committee chairmanships. Truman had greater latitude to act on civil rights when he could act alone. For that reason his greatest civil rights accomplishments were things within executive power: the issuance of executive orders and the involvement of the Justice Department in landmark desegregation litigation.

- One of President Truman’s most important civil rights accomplishments was initiating desegregation of the armed services. Discrimination and segregation in the military were particularly galling to people of color who risked their lives to protect the nation yet were not treated equally even during their military service. When troops traveled to foreign lands, other nations were directly exposed to American racial practices. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1514))

- Waging the Cold War would require military strength. Military preparedness would be one line of defense against Soviet aggression. Although the armed forces were the nation’s physical line of defense against Soviet aggression, they were also a source of the nation’s moral failure, for American forces in the postwar years continued to be segregated.

Michael Sherry has written that “[c]ivil rights leaders, and Truman himself on occasion, did also invoke morality and justice, but national security was the dominant rationale” for civil rights reform. It was also “the most persistent.” While domestic politics and principle surely played a role in Truman’s decision to desegregate the military, safeguarding the nation’s overseas image, an important theme throughout Truman’s presidency, was also a critical factor.17 ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1585))

In a political and cultural climate steeped in anticommunism, arguing that civil rights reform would be a capitulation to communists, who themselves must clearly be pursuing ulterior motives to undermine American society, proved to be a very effective strategy. Anticommunism was more important to Congress than civil rights. For that reason, casting a red taint on a civil rights bill was an effective way to derail it.

- Desegregation of the military is often thought of as Truman’s principal civil rights accomplishment. Of great significance as well, however, was the Truman administration’s participation in the landmark desegregation cases leading up to Brown v. Board of Education. Although Brown itself was decided in 1954, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, it was Truman’s Justice Department that initiated the government’s participation in the legal battle to overcome Jim Crow. The Justice Department’s most important brief in Brown itself was filed in December 1952, during the last weeks of Truman’s presidency. The decision to participate in these cases was made at the highest levels of the Truman administration, at times involving the president himself.24 ([Location 1639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1639))

- In amicus curiae, or “friend of the court,” briefs in civil rights cases, the Truman administration stressed to the Supreme Court the international implications of race discrimination and at times focused on the negative impact on U.S. foreign relations that a prosegregation decision might have.25 In terms of its consequences for American prestige, a Court decision rendering segregation unconstitutional was potentially of the greatest symbolic value. Change emanating from a Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution would show that the principle of racial equality was already there in the governing document of American democracy. This would show that, as Gunnar Myrdal had suggested, it was a principle waiting to be realized as Americans perfected their practice of democracy.

- brief after brief, the Justice Department argued that crucial national interests were also implicated. The segregation challenged in these cases damaged U.S. prestige abroad and threatened U.S. foreign relations. In the context of heightened Cold War tensions, the stakes in these cases were very high.26 ([Location 1656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1656))

- The Truman Justice Department began its participation as amicus curiae in civil rights cases with a restrictive covenant case, Shelley v. Kraemer. In Shelley, whites sold residential property to African Americans in violation of a covenant among landowners prohibiting sales to nonwhites. State supreme courts in Missouri and Michigan had ruled that the covenants were enforceable. The question in Shelley was whether judicial enforcement of the covenants constituted “state action” violating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of the African Americans who purchased the property. The Justice Department argued that state court action was “state action” and therefore that when state courts enforced racially restrictive covenants they violated the Fourteenth Amendment.27 ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1659))
- In previous civil rights cases, the solicitor general participated when the litigation involved a federal agency and when the question in the case concerned the supremacy of federal law. A different sort of federal interest was involved in the restrictive covenant cases. According to Perlman, racially restrictive covenants hampered the federal government “in doing its duty in the fields of public health, housing, home finance, and in the conduct of foreign affairs.” The brief for the United States in Shelley v. Kraemer relied on the State Department’s view that “the United States has been embarrassed in the conduct of foreign relations by acts of discrimination taking place in this country.” To support this argument, the brief quoted at length from the Dean Acheson letter relied on in To Secure These Rights.28 ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1667))
- In Henderson, the Supreme Court ruled that railroad dining car segregation violated the Interstate Commerce Act because it was unequal treatment. Since segregation violated a federal statute, the Court did not need to decide whether segregation in interstate travel was unconstitutional and whether Plessy v. Ferguson should be overturned.34 ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1719))
- In the same year as the Henderson case, the Justice Department participated for the first time in cases challenging school segregation. The department argued that McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and Sweatt v. Painter were of “great importance” to the nation because “they test the vitality and strength of the democratic ideals to which the United States is dedicated.” In McLaurin, the University of Oklahoma had admitted an African American student, G. W. McLaurin, to its graduate program in education after he successfully challenged Oklahoma’s segregation statutes in federal district court, but McLaurin was segregated within the university. He was assigned to a separate table in the library, a separate row in the classroom, and a separate table in the cafeteria. The NAACP argued that this different treatment on the basis of race violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sweatt involved a challenge to racial segregation at the University of Texas Law School. Heman Marion Sweatt was denied admission to the law school because he was African American. When a state trial court found that the university’s action violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the state responded by quickly opening a separate black law school. There were great differences between the schools in libraries, faculties, and other resources. The question before the Supreme Court was whether the legal education provided at the black school was equal to that provided to whites at the University of Texas.35 ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1722))
- In Sweatt and McLaurin, the Supreme Court again sided with the Justice Department and the NAACP. In important rulings that significantly eroded the separate-but-equal doctrine, the Court found that segregation at the University of Texas Law School and the University of Oklahoma School of Education denied the African American plaintiffs equal treatment. The Court found that the plaintiffs’ very isolation from white students meant that the education provided to them was unequal. Isolating them from white classmates denied Heman Sweatt and G. W. McLaurin the equality guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court, however, declined to reconsider directly the constitutionality of segregation itself. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1746))
- To document this claim, the Justice Department devoted nearly two pages of the brief to a lengthy quotation from Dean Acheson, who was now secretary of state. Acheson expanded upon his earlier statement on race discrimination. Now he argued that the problem had worsened. [D]uring the past six years, the damage to our foreign relations attributable to [race discrimination] has become progressively greater. The United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of discrimination against minority groups in this country. As might be expected, Soviet spokesmen regularly exploit this situation in propaganda against the United States, both within the United Nations and through radio broadcasts and the press, which reaches all corners of the world. Some of these attacks against us are based on falsehood or distortion; but the undeniable existence of racial discrimination gives unfriendly governments the most effective kind of ammunition for their propaganda warfare. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1791))
- World attention to U.S. discrimination was of increasing concern to the State Department, because the hostile reaction among normally friendly peoples, many of whom are particularly sensitive in regard to the status of non-European races, is growing in alarming proportions. In such countries the view is expressed more and more vocally that the United States is hypocritical in claiming to be the champion of democracy while permitting practices of racial discrimination here in this country.44 ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1799))
- The secretary of state concluded that “racial discrimination in the United States remains a source of constant embarrassment to this Government in the day-to-day conduct of its foreign relations; and it jeopardizes the effective maintenance of our moral leadership of the free and democratic nations of the world.”45 ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1806))
- The final statement in the brief consisted of a quote from President Truman: If we wish to inspire the people of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil liberties, if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours, we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy. We know the way. We need only the will.46 ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1814))

- When Brown v. Board of Education was decided, the opinion gave the U.S. government the counter to Soviet propaganda it had been looking for, and the State Department and U.S. information programs wasted no time in making use of it. Within an hour after the decision was handed down, the Voice of America broadcast the news to Eastern Europe. An analysis accompanying the “straight news broadcasts” emphasized that “the issue was settled by law under democratic processes rather than by mob rule or dictatorial fiat.” ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=1908))

- Although Brown was heralded as a great advance, significant segregation remained in the nation’s schools. The Supreme Court appeared satisfied, for the time being, with abstract pronouncements about equality. When Brown was decided in 1954, the Court announced the formal legal principle that racial segregation in public education violated the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Court put off the question of how the denial of equal rights might be remedied. In 1955, the Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education II that lower courts should fashion relief in a way that led to desegregation “with all deliberate speed.” The lower courts, in taking up Brown II, interpreted it as an indication that delaying school desegregation was appropriate. As a result, the rights upheld in Brown remained abstract rights. The Supreme Court then stayed out of the business of defining and enforcing the rights in Brown for several years. Although the Court would extend Brown’s desegregation principle to other areas, in the school cases the Court, for the most part, remained silent. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2003))
- Following Brown, the world kept a close eye on U.S. race relations, but the perspective had changed for the better. In Madras, India, for example, the American consul reported that “South India interest in the progress of racial desegregation in the United States has been keen ever since the Supreme Court’s decision.” The Montgomery bus boycott and white resistance to Autherine Lucy’s attempt to enroll at the University of Alabama were prominently covered in newspapers in that region, but the coverage reflected “the hope of most South Indians that the conflict will be resolved quickly and relatively painlessly, in compliance with the ruling of the Supreme Court.” ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2014))
- The continuing reality of racial brutality in the American South kept American race discrimination on the pages of the foreign press, but the framework provided by The Negro in American Life, capped by Brown v. Board of Education, provided a counternarrative to Soviet exploitation of this American dilemma. National policy was said to endorse ever burgeoning equality. The basic charter of the nation embraced equal rights for all. Yet the very document that provided the foundation for the value of equality, the American Constitution, also protected freedom to dissent. Expression of racial animosity was therefore a sign of the strength, not the weakness, of the nation. America was sufficiently sure of herself that she could tolerate the free expression of dissent even as she encouraged her people on the path toward racial enlightenment. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2026))
- Eisenhower’s response to Faubus was to emphasize that “when I became President, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.” ([Location 2080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2080))
- Little Rock crisis was to become a defining moment. It was not the first civil rights event in Eisenhower’s presidency to capture widespread international attention. Following the 1954 Brown decision, Emmet Till’s brutal murder in 1955 had outraged the world, the 1955–56 Montgomery bus boycott had focused international media attention on civil rights protest, and Autherine Lucy’s attempt to cross the color line at the University of Alabama in 1956 had become a civil rights crisis with international impact. Little Rock, however, was a crisis of such magnitude for worldwide perceptions of race and American democracy that it would become the reference point for the future. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2084))
- Foreign commentators would judge American progress by how far the nation had come from Little Rock. If slavery had been the benchmark against which American racial progress had been measured in the past, Little Rock provided a new measure, as the Cold War required more of the leader of the free world. ([Location 2090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2090))
- President Eisenhower later described the situation in his memoirs. He wrote that Faubus’s “outrageous action” in Little Rock called to my mind the first act of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific in which the hero, a Frenchman, mistakenly calls the heroine’s American hometown “Small Rock.” Before September 1957, that line was meaningless to foreign audiences. Thereafter, no one anywhere would miss the point: the name of Little Rock, Arkansas, would become known around the world. ([Location 2098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2098))
- Difficult though the problem might be, he added, “We are going to whip it in the long run by Americans being true to themselves, and not by law”—a comment that seems to be as wide of the real issue as was Polonius’s advice. Who is to say that the southerners—who see in attempts to integrate their schools a threat to the whole social fabric of their communities, and who try to prevent it by every means—are not being true to themselves? ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2124))
- The pressure on Faubus from the president was followed by a federal court order. On September 20, Judge Davies enjoined Governor Faubus from interfering with desegregation. If Faubus wanted to call in the troops, “the proper use of that power in this instance was to maintain the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction . . . and not to nullify ([Location 2233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2233))
- Mayor Mann sent the president a telegram saying that “[t]he immediate need for federal troops is urgent.” He warned that the “[s]ituation is out of control and police cannot disperse the mob.” Mann urged, “I am pleading to you as President of the United States in the interest of humanity law and order and because of democracy world wide to provide the necessary federal troops within several hours.” By this time, for Eisenhower, “the question had become not whether to act, but what force I should use to insure execution of the court’s order.” Eisenhower decided to rely on federal troops, and by that afternoon, five hundred paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division were stationed in the city. Another five hundred arrived later in the day. Armed with bayonets, the troops ringed Central High School on the morning of September 25. From the perspective of Governor Faubus and his supporters, the “occupation” of Little Rock had begun. ([Location 2255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2255))
- Eisenhower’s decision to act was not based on support for desegregation. He was not a supporter of court-ordered desegregation or of the Brown decision itself. Eisenhower communicated his feelings about the desegregation cases to Chief Justice Earl Warren while the cases were pending. He invited Warren to a dinner at the White House. Following the meal, Warren later wrote, Eisenhower took him by the arm, and “as we walked along, speaking of the Southern states in the segregation cases, he said, ‘These are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit alongside some big overgrown Negroes.’ ” Justice Warren felt that President Eisenhower’s lack of support for Brown contributed to the resistance to the decision. He believed that “much of our racial strife could have been avoided” if the president had stood up for the principal of equality. The nation seemed to agree with Justice Warren’s assessment. According to a 1955 Gallup Poll, one of the main criticisms of Eisenhower’s leadership was that he “encourages segregation.” ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2267))
- Ending with the exact language of the last words of the Pledge of Allegiance, Eisenhower appealed to patriotism. Little Rock was not simply an internal dispute: the nation, the national image, and national security were at stake. Patriotism required that the needs of the nation be placed ahead of sectional loyalties. ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2332))
- As a semblance of order, if not tranquillity, descended at last on Little Rock, the military presence declined. The 101st Airborne would leave the city by early November, and the Arkansas National Guard deployment was decreased by four-fifths. The remaining troops would patrol Central High School for the rest of the school year. Then, during the summer of 1958, the future of integration in Little Rock was placed, again, in the hands of the courts. On June 20, 1958, District Judge Harry J. Lemley, who had replaced Judge Davies, ordered that desegregation be postponed for two-and-a-half years. Judge Lemley agreed with the school board, which had sought the postponement, that the students’ education suffered under the difficult conditions Central High had endured that school year. ([Location 2413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2413))
- A reprieve from Little Rock coverage would come, but not quite the way American officials would have hoped. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite, rushing dramatically ahead of the United States in the space race. For Americans, the idea of a Soviet spaceship circling overhead led to a crisis in national confidence and, ultimately, a renewed commitment to improving education as well as accelerating the space race itself. Internationally, Sputnik, following Little Rock, was a second blow to U.S. prestige. ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2539))
- Faubus called for a local referendum in Little Rock, as provided for under the new law, and on September 27 the vote was 19,470 to 7,561 in favor of closing the schools rather than desegregating. High school would not open in Little Rock that fall. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2569))
- Cooper illustrated the working of American constitutionalism, and it preserved the argument that racial equality was an American ideal. While Brown had proclaimed that the tenets of American democracy embodied in the Constitution were fundamentally inconsistent with racial segregation, Cooper rescued that principle from the threat of extinction posed by massive resistance. ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2583))
- Flaherty told his audience that the Little Rock crisis was “related to the U.S. system of government,” and “there was always the possibility of strife between the national government and one or more of the state governments under the federal system.” Flaherty believed that “complete integration would be accomplished gradually. If this could be done peacefully . . . then the federal system of government would have achieved something of major importance.” The Times of India carried a lengthy analysis of federalism and desegregation by American journalist Anthony Lewis, who also argued that conflict over desegregation was a product of American federalism. ([Location 2597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2597))
- The small numbers of African American students at Little Rock high schools did not reflect a reluctance of African American parents to send their children to these schools. Rather, Little Rock had adopted a student-assignment process benignly called a “Pupil Placement Law.” Compared with the resistance measures of 1958, the Arkansas pupil placement law was quite dispassionate. The purpose of the act appeared on its face to have nothing to do with desegregation, but rather with the need for flexibility and selectivity in student assignments. The legislature determined that “any general or arbitrary reallocation of pupils heretofore entered in the public school system according to any rigid rule of proximity of residence or in accordance solely with request on behalf of the pupil would be disruptive to orderly administration.” When a student wished to be reassigned, a parent or guardian was required to file a petition with the school board on behalf of the individual child. A hearing would then be held to determine the appropriateness of the transfer. The statute identified a long list of criteria relevant to pupil placement decisions, including “[a]vailable room and teaching capacity . . . ; the suitability of established curricula for particular pupils; the adequacy of the pupil’s academic preparation . . . ; the scholastic aptitude and relative intelligence or mental energy or ability of the pupil; the psychological qualification of the pupil . . . ; the psychological effect upon the pupil of attendance at a particular school; . . . the home environment of the pupil,” and on and on. The one factor that spoke directly to the context of desegregation in Little Rock was the fact that in deciding whether a transfer was appropriate the school board could take into consideration “the possibility of breaches of the peace or ill will or economic retaliation within the community.” ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2612))
- As NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer Jack Greenberg put it, “violence and physical obstruction having failed, bureaucracy in the form of pupil assignment laws became the principal means of fighting integration.” The Supreme Court nevertheless allowed such plans to stand. There would be no drama attending the Court’s handling of this important issue. The lack of fanfare would not cause this issue to go unnoticed. To white southerners, the path was clear: bureaucratization could accomplish most of what overt resistance had not. ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2628))
- John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, “the Year of Africa.” Between January and November of that year, seventeen African nations achieved independence. A total of twenty-five former colonies on the continent had now been liberated. Eight more would follow while Kennedy was in office.4 Africans were particularly attuned to U.S. racial problems. ([Location 2664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2664))
- The Year of Africa was also the year of the Greensboro, North Carolina, lunch counter sit-ins. The civil rights movement entered a new phase as activists increasingly used the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience to challenge segregation and to direct attention to their struggle. The movement would be very effective in keeping worldwide attention focused on civil rights in the United States. ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2681))
- During the early 1960s, the civil rights movement no longer seemed bounded within the framework imposed during the McCarthy era. Activists still invoked the idea of American democracy in their rhetoric, and the icons of American democracy in their protest. Yet critiquing the nature of American democracy led to fewer federal consequences, at least on the surface. Red-baiting of the movement continued, but often behind the scenes. The consequences of protest at the hands of state authorities in the South, the Klan, and the forces of massive resistance remained, of course, as brutal as ever.9 As the movement broadened and shifted to the left, the federal government found itself needing to listen to new voices, to harsher critics. A posture of reluctant engagement characterized President Kennedy’s response to the movement during the first two years of his presidency, until in 1963, when he embraced civil rights and appeared to make that cause his own. ([Location 2694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2694))
- The administration had a civil rights agenda, but its priorities were not always the priorities of the movement. The Justice Department decided to focus its civil rights efforts on voting rights. As Kennedy aide Arthur Schlesinger put it, voting was perceived as “the keystone in the struggle against segregation.” Also, the vote “did not incite social and sexual anxieties” in the way that integration did. As a result, “[c]oncentrating on the right to vote . . . seemed the best available means of carrying the mind of the white South.” ([Location 2717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2717))
- On February 1, 1960, four African American college students held a sit-in at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworth’s in Greensboro, North Carolina. The North Carolina protest inspired others, and by August 1961 more than seventy thousand people had participated in sit-ins and more than three thousand had been arrested. Student involvement in the sit-ins and other movement activity was a catalyst behind the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in April 1960. Encouraged by Ella Baker of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), students created their own organization, which would be a major force in the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement was developing a broader base and was increasingly turning to the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience.16 ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2743))
- In spite of federal law, however, interstate bus travelers were still segregated in southern states. CORE planned to have an interracial group ride together on a nonsegregated basis to test compliance with the Court’s rulings. It was called the Freedom Ride.

- Thirteen Freedom Riders departed from Washington, D.C. on May 4 on two Trailways busses. Their destination was New Orleans. The Freedom Ride encountered resistance along the way. Tensions heightened when the riders arrived in Alabama. Outside Anniston, one bus was firebombed. In Anniston and Birmingham, riders were brutally attacked by mobs. Rider Walter Bergman suffered permanent brain damage, and many others required medical care for beating injuries and smoke inhalation. The riders were committed to continuing their journey, but no bus drivers would take them. With Justice Department help, the Freedom Riders instead flew to New Orleans.

- On May 20, SNCC members continued the Freedom Ride from Birmingham to Montgomery. President Kennedy thought he had assurance from Alabama Governor John Patterson that the riders would be protected, but a mob of a thousand met the riders and savagely beat them. Justice Department aide John Siegenthaler was attacked and knocked unconscious in the melee. Martin Luther King Jr. then came to the city, addressing a mass meeting that itself became the target of violence. President Kennedy was forced to act, and sent six hundred federal marshals to the scene. ([Location 2759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2759))

- Following negotiations between the administration and Mississippi’s governor, when the Freedom Ride arrived in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 24, police officers were on hand and kept the peace. The officers directed the riders from the bus, through the waiting rooms, and into paddy wagons. The riders were arrested, convicted of breach of the peace, and sentenced to sixty-seven-day jail terms. The federal government did not intervene.26 ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2811))

- September 1962, the University of Mississippi in Oxford handed the Kennedy administration a civil rights crisis that would resonate even more forcefully overseas then the Freedom Rides had done. James Meredith, a resident of Mississippi, applied to the university and was rejected solely because he was African American. Meredith sued the university, and in June 1962 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Meredith’s exclusion was unconstitutional. After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett responded that the state would “not surrender to the evil and illegal forces of tyranny.” Ultimately, with Barnett recalcitrant and mobs on campus protesting Meredith, Kennedy sent in federal marshals. Through the night of September 30, a battle raged between troops and demonstrators. Two people were killed, including a French reporter, and hundreds were wounded. The next morning, with troops in control of the campus, Meredith was registered. ([Location 2825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2825))

- The USIA responded with a detailed report on the international reaction to the crisis at Ole Miss. The lessons to be drawn from it were clear. Definitive federal action in civil rights crises would have a positive effect on the nation’s image abroad. A more passive civil rights stance might serve the president’s interest in not alienating the South before the 1964 election and in keeping his other legislative priorities from getting sidetracked by a congressional battle over civil rights. An active posture, however, would better serve U.S. foreign affairs. ([Location 2880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=2880))

- As Marshall remembered it, “the pictures of the police dogs and fire hoses going throughout the country stirred the feelings of every Negro in the country, most whites in the country, and I suppose particularly colored persons throughout the world. And all of that emotion was directed at President Kennedy. ‘Why didn’t he do something?’ ” The concern about Birmingham’s impact led the administration to play a key role in resolving the crisis. Kennedy dispatched Marshall to the city, and Marshall helped manage negotiations that led to an agreement between the SCLC, the local government, and the business community. Under the pact, steps would be taken to desegregate facilities in large department stores, redress employment discrimination, and release jailed civil rights demonstrators.

- Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door to block the integration of the University of Alabama. On May 21, 1963, a federal district judge had ordered the university to admit two African American students to its summer session. At his inauguration earlier in the year, Wallace had pledged “Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!” in front of television cameras and a crowd of reporters from around the world. Now, he stood behind a line drawn in front of the doorway of the university administration building, decrying the “unwelcome, unwanted and force-induced intrusion . . . by the central government.” With careful planning, and the president’s order to federalize the Alabama National Guard, the students were quietly registered later that day. Still, Wallace and southern defiance had an important moment in the spotlight. A need to respond helped motivate President Kennedy to take a step his advisors and civil rights activists had been urging for some time. On the evening of June 11, 1963, Kennedy delivered an impassioned plea for civil rights reform before a nationwide television audience.

- Kennedy called civil rights “a moral issue . . . as old as the scriptures and . . . as clear as the American Constitution.” He believed that “[t]he heart of the question” was “whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.” While Kennedy presented the issue as a question of morality, its resolution would protect the freedom of all Americans, for “this Nation . . . will not fully be free until all its citizens are free.”63 We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or cast [sic] system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes?64 ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3083))

- The defining public battleground had shifted from the courts to Congress in part because the movement demanded rights beyond what the courts were likely to provide. Discrimination by seemingly private parties—restaurant, hotel, and gas station owners, for example—was discrimination the Supreme Court considered a matter of state, not federal, concern. Federal rights to equal protection of the laws only came into play when the state itself practiced discrimination. Private discrimination, in contrast, was not a matter of federal constitutional concern.72 ([Location 3135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3135))

- The discrimination against African diplomats on Route 40 and against African American students at Greensboro lunch counters was not discrimination at the hands of the state. As a result, based on an understanding of federalism and individual rights dating back to the 1880s, this was discrimination that the courts, acting alone, would not redress. To remedy this problem, the civil rights movement, supporters of civil rights in Congress, and, ultimately, President Kennedy himself, set their sights on a new civil rights bill. In what would later become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress relied on its expansive power to regulate private activities that had an impact on interstate commerce. Because discrimination in private businesses was thought to harm the economy, Congress could outlaw it under the Commerce Clause.

- According to Rusk, decolonization was “[o]ne of the epochal developments of our time.” “The vast majority of these newly independent peoples are nonwhite, and they are determined to eradicate every vestige of the notion that the white race is superior or entitled to special privileges because of race.” The United States was engaged in a world struggle for freedom, against the forces of communism. Rusk warned that “in waging this world struggle we are seriously handicapped by racial or religious discrimination in the United States. . . . In their efforts to enhance their influence among the non-white peoples and to alienate them from us, the Communists clearly regard racial discrimination in the United States as one of their most valuable assets.”78 ([Location 3182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3182))

- At the same time, he had also come to terms with a point Roy Wilkins and Arnold Aaronson had pressed upon him during his first days in office. Civil rights was not a distraction from economic and foreign policy. Rather, it was intertwined with Kennedy’s other objectives: “the third leg of the stool.”110 A president who campaigned for office using foreign affairs—Africa policy—to court a domestic constituency—black voters—ultimately understood that questions of justice at home reflected overseas, affecting his role as a world leader.

- In giving life to Kennedy’s vision, one initiative stood out in importance. According to Johnson, [N]o memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. . . . It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law. . . . There could be no greater source of strength to this Nation both at home and abroad.

- To fulfill this important commitment, Johnson asked for the help of the Congress and the nation. “We meet in grief,” he said, “but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor. Let us meet in action, in tolerance, and in mutual understanding. John Kennedy’s death commands what his life conveyed—that America must move forward.” And this progress, now presented as Kennedy’s legacy, required especially racial justice. “The time has come for Americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another.” It was Johnson’s hope that “the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in a new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow.” This unity would give meaning to the tragedy. Johnson urged, “[L]et us here highly resolve that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not live—or die—in vain.”3 ([Location 3476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3476))

- The Vietnam War soon pushed domestic civil rights off the table as a major factor determining American prestige abroad, just as shifts within the civil rights movement and among the electorate changed the dynamics and undermined the fragile consensus about civil rights politics at home. By 1965, urban unrest made it clear that the problem of inequality could not be fully solved by the president’s civil rights agenda, even if meaningful reform was still within reach under the shadow of Vietnam. At home, the story of race and American democracy became more complex; overseas, American militarism cast a new shadow on the nation’s image.

- In 1963, under Secretary of State Dean Rusk’s leadership, the Kennedy administration had already made the point that enacting strong civil rights legislation would help ameliorate the impact of race discrimination on the nation’s overseas image. It was left to the Johnson administration to carry the bill forward and ensure its passage. Johnson’s legendary skills at forging a legislative majority meant that he was particularly well suited to carry out this task. His personal ambition to make his own mark and to set himself apart from his predecessor led Johnson to push for a stronger civil rights bill than had Kennedy.14 ([Location 3565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3565))

- During Freedom Summer, students flocked to the South to work in the civil rights movement. Hundreds of college students joined veteran civil rights activists to help with voter registration in Mississippi. The infusion of white college students into the southern civil rights movement brought publicity and resources but did not soften the terms of racial politics in Mississippi. Early in the summer, three young men, one African American and two whites, were missing. Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael Schwerner had been arrested on their way to investigate the bombing of a black church. When their broken bodies were finally discovered in an earthen dam, a new wave of outrage swept the nation and the world.

- The rights protected by the Civil Rights Act would, at least formally, create a legal regime of equal treatment, yet as race riots continued to plague American cities, formal legal rights could not alleviate the distress in many communities. Congressional action on civil rights did not speak to the poverty, joblessness, and police brutality in the nation’s cities. And so, ironically, as the United States achieved one of its greatest milestones in the struggle for racial justice, the nation’s grip on race relations seemed to be failing.

- During the 1960s, many civil rights advocates traveled overseas. They hoped to spread the word about the U.S. civil rights movement, gain support from citizens of other nations, and encourage independence movements around the world. Many activists saw the struggle for civil rights in the United States and anticolonial movements abroad as different branches of one worldwide human rights movement. Civil rights activists turned especially to Africa, which became a source of support and inspiration. ([Location 3752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=3752))

- In response to Selma, Congress acted quickly, passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 within six months. The act was intended to outlaw the variety of methods used by state and local governments to disenfranchise African American voters. Discriminatory literacy tests, poll taxes, and other voter registration requirements, as well as violence against African Americans who tried to register and vote, had kept large numbers of African Americans from the polls. Under the new law, registration restrictions used to disenfranchise racial minorities were invalidated. The act also required that future voting practices in discriminatory jurisdictions be approved by the attorney general, and it authorized federal examiners to ensure evenhanded application of the law. With these provisions in place, more than 230,000 new African American voters registered within a year after the act was signed.

- The community of Watts in Los Angeles had long experienced poverty and segregation. What set off the uprising in August 1965 was the arrest of an African American motorist by white police officers. The incident quickly spiraled out of control. Thousands soon battled police and then turned to looting and burning. After three days the National Guard was called in. When the smoke finally cleared after seven days, thirty-four people had been killed, and Watts had sustained over forty million dollars in property damage. Urban racial conflict would come to many American cities. ([Location 4066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=4066))

- In the fall of 1966, Senator James Eastland of Mississippi opened his campaign by announcing proudly that “[t]he sentiment of the entire country now stands with the southern people.” While Eastland surely overstated his case, the tenor of American politics and public culture had changed. Only two years before, the nation had rallied behind passage of the Civil Rights Act. In the chill of backlash politics leading up to the 1968 presidential campaign, those heady days of civil rights victories seemed a world away.88 In 1964, George Wallace and then Barry Goldwater had given voice to the impatience of some white voters with black protest. All along there had been an undercurrent of white opinion, in the North as well as the South, that blacks were seeking too much too soon. Once important new civil rights laws were passed in 1964 and 1965, some whites felt that blacks should be satisfied. Yet the formal equality established in the civil rights acts did not touch pervasive black poverty. Systemic segregation and disenfranchisement over so many years had affected labor patterns, causing race and class in America to be correlated. Formal equality would go a long way toward opening opportunities for the middle class. For the poor, for those living in blighted urban areas now bereft of industry, formal equality would help break down the barrier of race. It would not touch the barrier of class. For urban blacks and other persons of color, as William Julius Wilson has argued, with the easing of overt racial barriers, class became a more central determinant of status.89 ([Location 4124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=4124))

- This environment bred new forms of oppression. When civil rights leaders joined forces with the antiwar movement, criticizing Johnson’s Vietnam policies, the FBI saw in the antiwar posture of civil rights leaders a new element of subversion. J. Edgar Hoover reported to the president that the Communist Party was engaged in a “massive effort to create a united front in opposition to United States military presence in Vietnam” and other activities designed to “exploit racial issues and to create the chaos upon which communism flourishes.” Hoover put a special counterintelligence unit, COINTELPRO, to work on domestic civil rights, antiwar and other progressive groups. It was designed to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist, hate-type organizations and groupings, their leadership, spokesmen, membership and supporters.” Not restricting itself to more militant groups like the Black Panthers, COINTELPRO also targeted leaders advocating nonviolence, including Martin Luther King Jr. ([Location 4188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006QNPIAC&location=4188))
