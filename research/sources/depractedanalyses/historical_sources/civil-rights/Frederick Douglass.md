### Highlights

- The “embrace of truth as best we can know it,” said the president, is “where real patriotism lies.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=76))
- few Americans used Shakespeare and the Bible to comprehend his story and that of his people as much as Douglass; and there may be no better example of an American radical patriot than the slave who became a lyrical prophet of freedom, natural rights, and human equality. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=83))
- It is likely that more Americans heard Douglass speak than any other public figure of his times. Indeed, to see or hear Douglass became a kind of wonder of the American world. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=97))
- he strongly believed in self-reliance and ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=109))
- In his own career he heroically tried to forge a livelihood with his voice and pen, but fundamentally was not a self-made man, an image and symbol he touted in a famous speech, and through which modern conservatives have adopted him as a proponent of individualism. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=114))
- In 1995 Lind rejected both a leftist multiculturalism and a conservative self-help individualism and called for a “new nationalism,” which he termed a “multiracial/mixed race Trans-America,” with Douglass as the model. Telescoping the orator though time, Lind called Douglass “the greatest American of all time.” ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=121))
- “The prophet is human,” wrote the great Jewish theologian Abraham Heschel, “yet he employs notes one octave too high for our ears. He experiences moments that defy our understanding. He is neither ‘a singing saint’ nor ‘a moralizing poet,’ but an assaulter of the mind. Often his words begin to burn where conscience ends.” ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=166))

- No African American speaker had ever faced this kind of captive audience, composed of all the leadership of the federal government in one place; and no such speaker would ever again until Barack Obama was inaugurated president in January 2009.

- “He [Lincoln] was preeminently the white man’s president,” Douglass continued in his forceful baritone, “entirely devoted to the welfare of the white man. He was ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people of the country.”12 ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=302))

- “viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as a statesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined.” ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=335))

- “the corner of the kitchen chimney” in winter to find warmth. At the Anthony house, the slave children, “like so many pigs,” ate cornmeal mush out of a “large wooden tray, or trough,” laid down on the floor of the kitchen or on the ground outdoors. An oyster shell was the only fork or spoon he knew until he moved to Baltimore. He slept in a closet, he tells us, and in extreme cold he would steal a bag used for carrying corn to the mill and, with “head in and feet out,” fitfully sleep on January and February nights. There were no beds or blankets for the slave children. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=750))
- Baltimore had the largest concentration of free persons of color in the United States, a demographic fact that would play a key role in Douglass’s fate. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=876))
- If “knowledge unfits a child to be a slave,” Douglass later wrote, then he had found the motive power of his path out, or at least inward, to freedom. Ever ready to employ biting irony to make his case, Douglass left this telling and honest description of the lesson learned: “That which he most loved I most hated; and the very determination which he expressed to keep me in ignorance, only rendered me the more resolute in seeking intelligence.” ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=942))
- Their opposition became his motive power, their arguments his own tools of counterargument in the courts of moral justice. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=950))
- From experience, Douglass had his own ways of showing how the more perfect the slave, the more enslaved the master. And he showed how slavery, no matter how brutal its forms and conditions, was the meeting of two kinds of consciousness in a test of wills, and that total domination or absolute authority by the master was only rarely possible. He understood just how much the master’s own identity as an independent, powerful person depended on the slave’s recognition ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=955))
- However hard she tried, it was all but impossible for her to see the black eleven- and twelve-year-old as mere chattel. “I was more than that,” he asserted, “and she felt me to be more than that. I could talk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and remember; I could love and hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew and felt me to be so.” ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=971))
- have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Anything, no matter what to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had aroused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1075))
- Douglass gave voice to the reality of social death. “Horses and men—cattle and women—pigs and children—all holding the same rank in the scale of social existence; and all subjected to the same narrow inspection, to ascertain their value in gold and silver. . . . How vividly, at that moment, did the brutalizing power of slavery flash before me! ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1119))
- longer faced the slaveholder’s whip (for now), but they did. “The overseer had written his character on the living parchment of most of their backs, and left them callous.” ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1125))
- mistress Sophia over reading took a heavy emotional toll. The boy craved love and affection, and when he found it, he held on tight; when he lost it, he spun into despair. As he reached puberty and adolescence Frederick wanted some element of certainty, and now he seemed to find only confusion. Sophia’s “abuse” fell upon him like a mother’s sudden betrayal. “Nature had made us friends,” he later wrote, “slavery made us enemies.” Denied his joy in reading, unable to forge new forms of hope, Frederick descended into a “leaden, downcast” disposition. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1138))
- Douglass converted this memory into angry condemnations of the religious hypocrisy of the entire Christian slaveholding universe, especially the little microcosm of Auld’s household, where the young slave now had to listen daily to loud praying and testifying by the white family, and to participate in hospitality extended to local preachers who were sometimes housed at Auld’s home, all the while enduring the good Methodist’s verbal and physical cruelty. For Douglass, the proof of any sincerity in Auld’s “teardrop” manifested in his actions. In his deeds and his glances, wrote Douglass, it was as if the pathetic master had concluded, “I will teach you, young man, that, though I have parted with my sins, I have not parted with my sense. I shall hold my slaves, and go to heaven too.” ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1290))
- Douglass’s great gift, and the reason we know of him today, is that he found ways to convert the scars Covey left on his body into words that might change the world. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CL618JT&location=1327))
