### Highlights

- One lesson the past century has taught us is that authoritarian regimes often find history profoundly threatening. At every opportunity, these regimes find ways of erasing or concealing history in order to consolidate their power.

- Authoritarianism’s great rival, democracy, requires the recognition of a shared reality that consists of multiple perspectives. Through exposure to multiple perspectives, citizens learn to regard one another as equal contributors to a national narrative. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=65))
- this narrative is open to continued collective reflection and re-imagination, constantly taking into account new ideas, new evidence, new perspectives and theoretical framings. History in a democracy is not static, not mythic, but dynamic and critical. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=67))
- Erasing history helps authoritarians because doing so allows them to misrepresent it as a single story, a single perspective. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=69))
- The sides in this war have largely been shaped by two opposing perspectives: those who wish to preserve hierarchies rooted in arbitrary factors like race, ethnicity, and gender—and those who wish to upend them. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=97))
- A liberal democracy is a system that centers the values of freedom and equality, in which all citizens have equal political value—and are thus entitled to equal respect and dignity. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=142))
- Hierarchies of value violate the fundamental ideals of liberal democracy—and, indeed, cannot tolerate the equal moral and political status of all people. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=157))
- Cultures of hierarchy—such as colonialism, nationalism, or fascism—involve practices that place one group above others. And as is the case with all other cultures, or forms of life, these practices are in large part shaped and reinforced by schools. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=161))
- Every education system involves erasure—one simply cannot teach everything. There are, however, certain kinds of erasures that are constitutive of authoritarian systems. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=163))
- By removing the history of uprisings against the current status quo from the curriculum (or never allowing that history to be taught in the first place), authoritarians leave students with the impression that the status quo has never been—and cannot be—challenged. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=167))
- According to the Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt, “[t]he specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and enemy.”3 Which is to say, for fascists, being political means defining oneself against an enemy. As such, fascist regimes selectively disenfranchise certain segments of their population and violently cast them into what the political philosopher Elizabeth F. Cohen calls “semi-citizenship,” in order to emphasize the virtue and worth of the dominant group. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=183))
- A fascist form of life is suffused with fear that others will achieve equal status, a possibility cynically exploited in fascist politics. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CV2229FC&location=198))
- it requires an education system that can validate the dominant group’s elevated status as a justified consequence of history rather than the fabricated result of intentional choices. It does this, as we will see, by selectively doctoring the historical record, erasing perspectives and events that are unflattering to the dominant group, and replacing them with a unitary, simplified account that supports its ideological ends.
