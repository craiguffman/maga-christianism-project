### Highlights

- Christianity was grounded in and depended on its Jewish roots, and to be anti-Jewish was to be antiChristian. The Nazi fight with Judaism was of the movement's essence, necessary to the blood-bound folk paganism of Nazism.

- Tillich 's first political speech in English, in a rally at Madison Square Garden in 1938. attacked Hitler's anti-Semitism. Tillich appealed for unity between Jews and Christians on the foundation of prophetic religion. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072J8STJF&location=142))

- Further, the historic identity of the Jewish people had a significant place in Tillich' s theology, as well as in his philosophy of history. Theologically, the Jews are the inspiration for his notion of the Protestant principle, that element of perpetual critique that stands against the ever-present threats of idolatry and utopianism.

- The reader will probably recognize in these pages the theology of prophetic religion more than a christological theology. It is a theology for very troubled nations upon whom judgment has come or is coming in its historically ambiguous character. The author recognizes the hope for self-liberation, but it has not been historically realized. Judgment and retribution upon evil are more sure than liberation in this theology.

- Before the war ended, Tillich would be blacklisted by the U.S. Army as pro-German. Indeed, he was deeply pro-German -and, as the following pages reveal, deeply pro-Jewish and totally anti-Nazi. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B072J8STJF&location=183))

- See to it that more and more Germans grasp that a power that has destroyed justice is surely no longer power, even when it still has the most enormous tools of oppression in its hand. Tell the Germans that the idol of power has turned against its worshipers today and will destroy everyone who stands with them.
