### Highlights

- The key to the rise of authoritarians, they explained, is their use of language and false history.[3] ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=105))
- Authoritarians rise when economic, social, political, or religious change makes members of a formerly powerful group feel as if they have been left behind. Their frustration makes them vulnerable to leaders who promise to make them dominant again. A strongman downplays the real conditions that have created their problems and tells them that the only reason they have been dispossessed is that enemies have cheated them of power. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=107))
- Such leaders undermine existing power structures, and as they collapse, people previously apathetic about politics turn into activists, not necessarily expecting a better life, but seeing themselves as heroes reclaiming the country. Leaders don’t try to persuade people to support real solutions, but instead reinforce their followers’ fantasy self-image and organize them into a mass movement.

- Once people internalize their leader’s propaganda, it doesn’t matter when pieces of it are proven to be lies, because it has become central to their identity. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=113))
- As a strongman becomes more and more destructive, followers’ loyalty only increases. Having begun to treat their perceived enemies badly, they need to believe their victims deserve it. Turning against the leader who inspired such behavior would mean admitting they had been wrong and that they, not their enemies, are evil. This, they cannot do. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=114))
- the United States, sailing between the siren songs of fascism on the one side and communism on the other, had somehow avoided destruction. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=123))
- America took a different course in the 1930s not because Americans were immune to authoritarianism, but because they rallied around the language of human self-determination embodied in the Declaration of Independence. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=134))
- Americans chose a free future by choosing a principled past. But they could have chosen differently. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=143))
- From the nation’s beginning, the Founders’ embrace of equality depended on keeping women, people of color, and Black Americans unequal.[5] ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=145))
- That paradox had in it the potential for the rhetoric that authoritarians use, and in the past, those determined to undermine democracy have indeed gone down that road. Whenever it looked as if marginalized people might get an equal voice, designing political leaders told white men that their own rights were under attack. Soon, they warned, minorities and women would take over and push them aside.[6] ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=148))
- But the thinking behind the Confederacy—that people are inherently unequal and some should rule the rest—persisted. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=159))
- That thinking has once again brought us to a crisis. In the 1950s, business, religious, and political leaders insisted that the federal government’s defense of civil rights was an attempt to replace white men with minorities and women. To stay in control, politicians ramped up attacks on their perceived enemies and began to skew the machinery of government to favor their interests. Wealth surged upward. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=160))
- In the years after 1980, a political minority took over Congress, the state legislatures, the courts, and the Electoral College, and by 2016 the Economist Intelligence Unit had downgraded the U.S. from a “full democracy” to a “flawed democracy.” By 2021, warnings had become more dire. Freedom House, a nonprofit that charts the health of democracies internationally, “urgently” called for reforms after a decade in which “US democracy has declined significantly.”[8] ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=164))
- The election and then the presidency of Donald Trump hastened that decline. When the nation’s rising oligarchy met a budding authoritarian, the Republican Party embraced the opportunity to abandon democracy with surprising ease. In the four years of Trump’s presidency, his base began to look much like the one post–World War II scholars had identified: previously apathetic citizens turned into a movement based in heroic personal identity. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=168))
- He and his followers embraced the false past of the Confederates and insisted they were simply trying to follow the nation’s traditional principles. Eventually, they tried to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election to stay in power. And even after Trump had tried to undermine the principle of self-government on which the United States was founded, his followers stayed loyal. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=172))
- Critics of liberal democracy say that its focus on individual rights undermines the traditional values that hold societies together, values like religion and ethnic or racial similarities. Religious extremists in the U.S. have tried to tie their destruction of democracy into our history by insisting that the Founders believed that citizens must be virtuous and that religion alone can create virtue. By this line of thought, imposing religious values on our country is exactly what the Founders intended. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=177))
- This is a book about how a small group of people have tried to make us believe that our fundamental principles aren’t true. They have made war on American democracy by using language that served their interests, then led us toward authoritarianism by creating a disaffected population and promising to re-create an imagined past where those people could feel important again. As they took control, they falsely claimed they were following the nation’s true and natural laws. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BT4QFZRC&location=186))
