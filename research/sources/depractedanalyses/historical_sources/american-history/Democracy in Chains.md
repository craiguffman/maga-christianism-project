- transactional approach to dealmaking that made working with him particularly straightforward. If you did for him, he would do for you. And the things he might want from the Koch team were easy enough for them to provide. Having spurned the established Republican Party structure, and having never built up or run a normal organization in all his years in business, Trump needed both staff to run the executive branch and policy recommendations. But the biggest bonus for both parties was the opening up of three positions on the Supreme Court. Koch allies could supply Trump with suggested nominees who pleased both billionaire donors and the white Christian nationalist voters whom both Trump and the Koch network needed to prevail. And the network, through its well-funded operations including Americans for Prosperity, could (and did) also provide Trump with the ground troops and lobbyists to get his judicial nominees approved and score policy successes for him to boast about.

- There was no push from the American people to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Quite the contrary, the majority of Americans, already dealing with extreme weather change from drought to floods and terrifying fires, wanted action to address the unfolding climate catastrophe. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=173))
- The majority of Americans also did not want Roe v. Wade overturned. But the largest block of dependable votes for both Trump and the Koch network’s agenda, the religious right, did. And so a judicious decision that recognized women’s constitutional right to liberty and personal privacy, including the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, while recognizing competing perspectives by allowing abortion until a fetus reached viability outside the womb, was reversed by the Dobbs ruling, which gave Trump’s base what they alone wanted but couldn’t get through persuasion, thereby imposing a minority view on the majority.

- But their decades-long organizing to thwart the will of the majority of voters by stealth and disinformation, and thereby impose upon the rest of us a decidedly minority set of values and goals emerging from a group that is neither elected by the people nor accountable to the people is not, I would argue, all that different from the tiny group of inflamed Americans who thought they had the right to impose their desired election outcome on the rest of ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=192))
- What happens, though, when fair play doesn’t matter anymore to powerful actors? When how you win means little, just that you win? Those are the existential questions at the heart of the book, because libertarian strategists have identified an alternative route to radical change. The route they have chosen aims to outwit us, to go around us. Few Americans have any idea this route exists, let alone how close it is to the final destination.

- In the conclusion of the 2017 edition of Democracy in Chains, I explained that “the ultimate target of the well-heeled right’s stealth plan” was the Constitution. Only through “constitutional revolution,” instructed James McGill Buchanan, the Tennessee-born, Nobel Prize–winning economist whose story is at the heart of the book, could the libertarian vision of a shackled national government be achieved. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=221))
- But the “constitutional revolution” that Buchanan urged was much more than a new amendment. Since his death it has become an effort to open the door to an entire rewrite of the Constitution.[9] And to start the process by entering through the back door, not the front. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=234))
- state legislatures were given the right to call for the holding of a new constitutional convention. All that was required was for two-thirds of the state legislatures to file applications for such a convention. Congress would then be obliged to call it. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=256))
- After their defeat in the 2012 presidential election, a group of breathtakingly wealthy and highly strategic actors on the radical right quietly launched a new campaign. They had already used their wealth and savvy institution building to capture a majority of state legislatures in 2010, so the groundwork was in place.[16] ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=279))
- Its member legislators in each state were given detailed instructions, as well as model text to bring back to their statehouses, for a resolution to authorize an Article V Convention. As I write this new preface, twenty-eight of the thirty-four states needed to reach two-thirds have passed such enabling legislation.[17] ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=283))
- The first up would be one to require that the federal government balance its budgets annually. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=296))
- Libertarians see no legitimate role for government beyond providing for the national defense, ensuring the rule of law (above all, protecting private property), and maintaining social order (to wit: armies, courts, and police). No place for a social safety net, or even public education. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=305))
- Next up would be an amendment to end federal income taxation. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=307))
- Thus, another amendment (or amendments) would “limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government,” in the phrasing of the authorization pushed by the Convention of States. The plan is for a return to states’ rights of the high-handed variety that prevailed before the Progressive Era amendments, the New Deal, and the civil rights era. Federal measures that protect human rights and promote equality, which cover anything from the right to vote to the right to marry, could be rendered moot by states that don’t agree. No wonder, then, that in his endorsement of the Convention of States project, Fox host Sean Hannity invited his followers to “join the constitutional revolution.” ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=312))
- they would come into such a convention with a lock on almost three-fifths of the fifty states’ delegates, despite red states representing only one-third of the nation’s population. And these delegates would starkly overrepresent rural, more conservative whites, at the expense of the nation’s multiracial urban and suburban majority. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=320))
- Should enough state legislatures sign on to invoke Article V, there is actually nothing the rest of us can do to stop the process from going forward short of, frankly, revolution. Or as Mark Meckler gloats: once the advocates get to thirty-four authorizations, “Congress can’t stop us. The President can’t stop us. SCOTUS can’t stop us.” Nor can the American people. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=328))
- Faced with recission of constitution convention calls in seven states since 2017 owing to opponents’ organizing, the leaders of the convention push have realized that getting to thirty-four states is going to be too hard to come by honestly. And as Democrats have tried to correct their pre-2010 folly of failing to organize at the state level, the Republican grip on some purple states is slipping, which might lead to a few more recessions. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=345))
- If liberty, as Buchanan and others in the movement would use that term, had any hard and fast meaning, it lay in the conviction that every person, up to the very wealthiest among us, had the same right to control the earnings of his own labor as he saw fit, even when the majority thought that this money might be put to better use serving the public interest. In the movement’s view, government was the realm of coercion, and the market was the realm of freedom, of freely chosen, mutually valued exchange. ([Location 4592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4592))
- It is a contradiction in terms to remain a self-governing intellectual and be part of a messianic movement. Messiahs don’t entertain doubts. ([Location 4602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4602))
- Watching how Koch commandeered the Cato Institute for his “crude” plan to speed up the libertarian conquest of America by using the very governmental apparatus that libertarians had long criticized made him angry. He saw, too, that Koch had “no scruples concerning the manipulation of scholarship”; he wanted Cato’s output to aid his cause, period. When a few veteran libertarian board members and staff raised questions, he replaced them with his own people, who now included the kind of “social conservatives” and political party figures who were once anathema to libertarians. ([Location 4623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4623))
- The acclaimed jurist Louis Brandeis, who over the course of his lifetime amassed considerable wealth, once warned the American people that as a nation, “we must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” ([Location 4644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4644))
- “If you tell a great lie and repeat it often enough, the people will eventually come to believe it,” Joseph Goebbels, a particularly ruthless, yet shrewd, propagandist, is said to have remarked. ([Location 4654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4654))
- Today the big lie of the Koch-sponsored radical right is that society can be split between makers and takers, justifying on the part of the makers a Manichaean struggle to disarm and defeat those who would take from them. Attend a Tea Party gathering and you will hear endless cries about the “moocher class.”[11] Read the output of the libertarian writers subsidized by wealthy donors and you will encounter endless variations. David Boaz of the Cato Institute, to choose just one, speaks of the “parasite economy” that divides us into “the predators and the prey.”[12] Addressing an audience of $50,000-per-plate donors, Mitt Romney famously remarked that “47 percent” of voters were, in effect, leeches on “productive” Americans.[ ([Location 4655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4655))
- Is there any evidence to suggest that close to half of American society is intent on exploiting the rich through the tax system? That they contribute nothing, while using government to gang up on a defenseless minority that somehow, all on its own, generates wealth? Is it true that the wealthiest among us are being unfairly fleeced by government? ([Location 4663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4663))
- explained that with the “rewriting of the social contract” under way, people will be “expected to fend for themselves much more than they do now.” While some will flourish, he says, “others will fall by the wayside.” And because “worthy individuals” will manage to climb their way out of poverty, “that will make it easier to ignore those who are left behind.” Cowen foresees that “we will cut Medicaid for the poor.” Also, “the fiscal shortfall will come out of real wages as various cost burdens are shifted to workers” from employers and a government that does less. To “compensate,” the chaired professor in the nation’s second-wealthiest county recommends, “people who have had their government benefits cut or pared back” should pack up and move to lower-cost states like Texas. ([Location 4678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4678))
- Those who subscribe to the libertarian philosophy believe that the only legitimate role of government is to ensure the rule of law, guarantee social order, and provide for the national defense. That is why they have long been fervent opponents of Medicare, Medicaid for the poor, and, most recently, Obamacare. ([Location 4697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4697))
- Paul Ryan, has explained that such public provision for popular needs not only violates the liberty of the taxpayers whose earnings are transferred to others, but also violates the recipients’ spiritual need to earn their own sustenance. He told one audience that the nation’s school lunch program left poor children with “a full stomach—and an empty soul.”[18] ([Location 4699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4699))
- these zealots do not believe that the government should be involved in trying to promote public health, period. We are not talking about subsidized hip replacements and birth control. We are talking about things like basic sanitation, something governments have committed to since the Progressive Era as the single most important measure to stop waterborne epidemics such as cholera and typhoid. ([Location 4703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4703))
- Kristof.[19] The insiders’ thinking helps explain why. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina state senator elevated to the U.S. Senate in 2014 with backing from the Koch apparatus, has said that restaurants should be able “to opt out of” laws requiring employees to wash their hands after using the toilet, “as long as they post a sign that says, ‘We don’t require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom.’ The market will take care of that.”[ ([Location 4707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4707))
- Amity Shlaes, a libertarian journalist on the Wall Street Journal editorial board and author of a best-selling book based on Buchanan’s ideology, The Forgotten Man, came to a similar conclusion as the fight over Obamacare began. She “found that public choice theory explained everything,” including that “health officials’ interest in testing small children’s blood for lead made sense when one considered that finding poisoned children validated their jobs.”[22] The largely African American population of Flint, Michigan, knows firsthand what will happen to “people who fall by the wayside” in the new political economy run by people who think this way. ([Location 4715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4715))
- Just as the property rights supremacists would rather let people die than receive health care assistance or antismoking counsel from government, so they would rather invite global ecological and social catastrophe than allow regulatory restrictions on economic liberty. ([Location 4748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01EH1EL7A&location=4748))
- the Cato Institute and the Independent Institute joined a circle of less-known Koch-funded libertarian think tanks driving what two science scholars describe as systematic environmental “misinformation campaigns.” They spread junk pseudoscience to make the public believe that there is still doubt about the peril of climate change, a tactic they learned from the tobacco companies that for years sowed doubt about science to keep the public from connecting smoking and illness.[29] Even more galling are the personal attacks on scientists that suggest, as one Koch-subsidized organization has done, that climate scientists are seeking personal monetary rewards.
