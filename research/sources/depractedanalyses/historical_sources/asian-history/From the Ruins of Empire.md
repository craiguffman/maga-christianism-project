- Japan had set itself an ambitious task of internal modernization from 1868: of replacing a semi-feudal shogunate with a constitutional monarchy and unified nation-state, and of creating a Western-style economy of high production and consumption. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=87))
- The most far-reaching changes occurred in China, culminating in the overthrow of one of the world’s oldest imperial dynasties in 1911. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=122))

- The twentieth century opened with German soldiers mounting punitive raids against anti-Western Chinese Boxers, the United States suppressing a rebellion in the Philippines, and the British fighting, with the help of Indian soldiers, Dutch settlers in southern Africa. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=147))
- But Japan’s victory over Russia accelerated an irreversible process of intellectual, if not yet political, decolonization. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=150))
- For most people in Europe and America, the history of the twentieth century is still largely defined by the two world wars and the long nuclear stand-off with Soviet Communism. But it is now clearer that the central event of the last century for the majority of the world’s population was the intellectual and political awakening of Asia and its emergence from the ruins of both Asian and European empires.

- These early modern Asians stand at the beginning of the process whereby ordinary resentment against the West and Western dominance, along with anxiety about internal weakness and decay, was transformed into mass nationalist and liberation movements and ambitious state-building programmes across Asia. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=201))
- Liang Qichao bequeathed his obsession with building state power to Mao Zedong and his heirs in Communist China; al-Afghani’s fear of the West and obsession with Muslim self-strengthening prepared the way for Atatürk and Nasser as well as Ayatollah Khomeini, and still animates the politics of Islamic societies. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=209))
- the reactionary conviction that if Asian people were truly faithful to their religious traditions, which were presumed to be superior to those of all other civilizations, they would be strong again; the moderate notion that only a few Western techniques were required by Asians whose traditions already provided a sound basis for culture and society; and the vigorous determination, embraced by radical secularists like Mao and Atatürk, that the entire old way of life had to be revolutionized in order to compete in the jungle-like conditions of the modern world. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=213))
- France needed colonies in order to prosper, as its foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand believed, and a presence in Egypt would not only compensate the French for their loss of territory in North America, it could also pose a serious challenge to the British East India Company, which produced highly profitable cash crops in its Indian possessions. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=235))
- Indeed the French, he claimed, were also Muslims, by virtue of their rejection of the Christian Trinity. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=251))
- Indeed, Islam was as much a universalizing ideology as Western modernity is now, and it successfully shaped distinctive political systems, economies and cultural attitudes across a wide geographical region: the fourteenth-century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta had as little trouble getting jobs at imperial courts in India or in West Africa as a Harvard MBA would in Hong Kong and Cape Town today. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=305))
- Though beset by internal problems in the eighteenth century, Muslim empires still regarded Europeans as only slightly less barbarous than their defeated Crusader ancestors. So the success of Napoleon suggested something inconceivable: that the Westerners, though still quite crude, were beginning to forge ahead. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=315))
- an idea of itself through its manifold achievements of technology, constitutional government, secular state and modern administration; and this idea, which emerged from the American and French revolutions and which seemed to place the West in the avant-garde of progress, would be increasingly hard to refute. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=318))
- Two centuries later, al-Jabarti seems to stand at the beginning of a long line of bewildered Asians: men accustomed to a divinely ordained dispensation, the mysterious workings of fate and the cyclical rise and fall of political fortunes, to whom the remarkable strength of small European nation-states would reveal that organized human energy and action, coupled with technology, amount to a power that could radically manipulate social and political environments. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=349))
- In 1824 the British, ensconced in eastern India, began their long subjugation of Burma. In the same year an Anglo-Dutch treaty confirmed British control of Singapore and the Malay states of the Peninsula while demarcating the influence of the Netherlands over Java. Neither Britain nor the Dutch, in turn, stood in the way of French domination of Vietnam. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=367))
- Their luck finally turned in the next few years. In 1757, after a battle with Bengal’s Muslim viceroy, the East India Company found itself in possession of a territory three times larger than England. Less than a decade later, the Company had successfully deployed the same combination of political skulduggery and military force to undermine the ruler of Awadh, the largest of the Mughal Empire’s provinces. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=382))
- Increasingly powerful in India, the British could afford to be more aggressive in China, where European traders, confined to the port of Canton, had long fantasized about the potentially huge inland market for their goods. Since they occupied rich agricultural lands in eastern India, the British were particularly keen to find buyers for their produce, especially opium, and they chafed at the arbitrary and opaque nature of China’s imperial authority. Emboldened by their successes in India, the British travelled a much shorter distance between awe and contempt in confronting the rulers of China. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=400))
- not even Islam could parallel the extraordinary longevity and vitality of Chinese Confucianism, which regulated everything from familial relations to political and ethical problems and had eager imitators in Korea, Japan and Vietnam. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=407))
- Those who refused to sign bonds pledging not to indulge in opium trafficking were summarily expelled: it was then that a group of British traders first settled on the rocky island called Hong Kong. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=464))
- After arriving in June 1840, the ships blockaded Canton and sailed up China’s north coast, finally threatening the city of Tianjin and beyond it the seat of the emperor himself in Beijing. Aware of their weak military, the Qing sued for peace, ceding Hong Kong to the British and agreeing to pay an indemnity of £6 million and to reopen Canton to British traders. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=475))
- After suffering more military reverses the Chinese again capitulated and signed the humiliating Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, which opened five trade ports, including Shanghai, to foreigners and granted Hong Kong to the British in perpetuity. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=481))
- Demanding compensation for the opium destroyed, the British asked for more indemnities, including ransom for those cities, such as Hangzhou, that they had not occupied. Other Western nations followed suit, notably the United States, which had maintained a presence in Canton since its own liberation from British rule. The Americans insisted that the Chinese allow Protestant missionaries to work in the treaty ports. The French asked for even broader rights for Catholics, completing the identification in Chinese eyes between the West and the proselytizing religion of Christianity. The treaties gave Western powers the right to dictate vital aspects of China’s commercial, social and foreign policies for the next century. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=494))
- In 1854, as the Qing faced the growing Taiping rebellion, British, French and American representatives demanded revisions to the Nanjing Treaty facilitating free access to all parts of China, unimpeded navigation of the Yangtze, their diplomatic presence in Beijing, the legalization of opium, and the regulation of Chinese labour emigration (during the lawlessness that prevailed at the end of the Opium War, Chinese men were kidnapped or deceived into travelling to places as far away as California and Cuba to supply local demands for cheap labour). ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=503))
- who, under Napoleon III, were keen to flex their muscles. In 1859, Lord Elgin, the son of the earl who had taken the marble friezes from the Parthenon to England, ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=509))
- The Chinese had to be taught a severe lesson. The French excused themselves from this act of retribution, in which British troops torched the Summer Palace, before Elgin proceeded to sign the treaty that gave the British more indemnities, and another treaty port (in Tianjin) and legations for all Western powers in Beijing. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=526))
- By late 1898, when the failure of the so-called ‘Hundred-Day’ reforms at the Qing court seemed clear, China had finally begun to look, in Liang’s view, as vulnerable to the West as Turkey and India, its predicament part of a global one caused by Western-style capitalism and imperialism. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=539))
- The philosopher Yan Fu described an increasingly widespread Chinese view of the Opium War by the late 1890s: When the Westerners first came, bringing with them immoral things that did harm to people [i.e., opium], and took up arms against us, this was not only a source of pain to those of us who were informed; it was then and remains today a source of shame to the residents of their capital cities. At the time, China, which had enjoyed the protection of a series of sagacious rulers, and with its vast expanse of territories, was enjoying a regime of unprecedented political and cultural prosperity. And when we looked about the world, we thought there none nobler among the human race than we.37 ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=543))
- Since the 1890s, the Opium War and the destruction of the Summer Palace have been carefully remembered in China as the most egregious of the humiliations the country suffered at the hands of the West in the nineteenth century. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=549))
- how a ‘whole nation, China, has been forced by Great Britain to accept the opium poison – simply for commercial greed’. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=551))
- For many Indians this was also true of the Mutiny of 1857, which spelt the end of centuries-long Muslim rule over India. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=557))
- The replacement of Persian by English as the official language also undermined the traditional cultural world of Indian Muslims. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=585))
- the Muslims’ former subjects – Hindus – seemed to be favoured by the new rulers, and were quick to educate themselves in Western-style institutions and assume the lowly administrative positions assigned to them. The British were beginning to replace their economic and political regime of pure plunder, as had existed in Bengal, with monopoly interests in shipping, banking, insurance and trade, and administrative structures. They enlisted native collaborators, such as the middlemen who expedited the lucrative export of opium grown in India to China, but these tended to be Hindu, Sikh or Parsi rather than Muslim. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=590))
- Lord Macaulay dismissed Indian learning as risibly worthless, enjoining the British in India to create ‘a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinion, in morals, and in intellect’. Convinced of their superiority, the British sought to entrench it with profound social and cultural reforms wherever they could in India. Often run by Christian missionaries, British-style schools, colleges and universities in India were soon churning out faux-Englishmen of the kind Macaulay had hoped ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=596))
- Many Muslims spurned this modern education out of fear of deracination. They mostly watched helplessly as the British set up plantations, dug canals and laid roads, and turned India into a supplier of raw materials to, and exclusive market for, British industries. Artisan communities in north Indian towns, which tended to be Muslim, were pauperized as British manufactured goods flooded Indian bazaars.

- Unprotected by tariffs, which the British insisted on reducing, the nascent local industries of Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Iran could not compete with the manufactured products imported from Europe. Not surprisingly, merchants, weavers and artisans in the bazaars of Cairo and Najaf, who perceived a direct threat from European businessmen and free traders, were at the forefront of anti-Western movements in the late nineteenth century. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=611))
- India’s most famous thinker of that century, Swami Vivekananda (1863 – 1902), articulated a widespread moral revulsion among Asians for their European masters: Intoxicated by the heady wine of newly acquired power, fearsome like wild animals who see no difference between good and evil, slaves to women, insane in their lust, drenched in alcohol from head to foot, without any norms of ritual conduct, unclean, materialistic, dependent on material things, grabbing other people’s land and wealth by hook or crook … the body their self, its appetites their only concern – such is the image of the western demon in Indian eyes. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=614))
- religion, which, as Marx shrewdly pointed out, was much more than a belief system: it was a ‘general theory of the world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in a popular form, its spiritualistic point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its universal source of consolation and justification’.

- the Mutiny made even the symbols of the Mughal Empire untenable. The formal end of Muslim power in India finally came when an English soldier executed the sons of the rebellious, and – as it turned out – last Mughal emperor, and left their corpses to rot in the streets of Delhi. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=664))
- Helped by new technologies, superior information-gathering and attractive trade terms, Europeans were by the mid-nineteenth century challenging the Chinese, pushing Persia out of its sphere of influence in the Caucasus, invading North Africa, forcing the Ottomans to open up their markets, promoting Christianity in Indochina and eyeing a long-secluded Japan. Eight decades after Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt, the British would successfully occupy that country. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=679))
- As more than one Asian observer noted, European forms of political and military mobilization (conscript armies, efficient taxation, codified laws), financial innovations (capital-raising joint-stock companies) and information-rich public cultures of enquiry and debate fed upon each other to create a formidable and decisive advantage as Europe penetrated Asia. Individually, Europeans might be no more brave, innovative, sensitive or loyal than Asians, but as members of corporate groups, churches or governments, and as efficient users of scientific knowledge, they mustered more power than the wealthiest empires of Asia. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=691))
- There had been other imperialisms in the past. Indeed, many victims of European conquests themselves belonged to powerful empires – Ottoman Turkey, Qing China. But modern European imperialism would be wholly unprecedented in creating a global hierarchy of economic, physical and cultural power through either outright conquest or ‘informal’ empires of free trade and unequal treaties. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=717))
- By 1900, a small white minority radiating out from Europe would come to control most of the world’s land surface, imposing the imperatives of a commercial economy and international trade on Asia’s mainly agrarian societies. Europeans backed by garrisons and gunboats could intervene in the affairs of any Asian country they wished to. They were free to transport millions of Asian labourers to far-off colonies (Indians to the Malay Peninsula, Chinese to Trinidad); exact the raw materials and commodities they needed for their industries from Asian economies; and flood local markets with their manufactured products. The peasant in his village and the market trader in his town were being forced to abandon a life defined by religion, family and tradition amid rumours of powerful white men with a strange god-on-a-cross who were reshaping the world – men who married moral aggressiveness with compact and coherent nation-states, the profit motive and superior weaponry, and made Asian societies seem lumberingly inept in every way, unable to match the power of Europe or unleash their own potential. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=726))
- The Industrial Revolution and Europe’s demand for raw materials for its manufacturing industries not only thwarted industrialization in Asia; it also forced traditionally self-sufficient peasants across Asia to become rubber-tappers, tin-miners, coffee-growers and tea-pickers. In Islamic societies, the imperative to match Western power and build a European-style centralized state created new classes of bureaucrats, technocrats, bankers, urban workers and intellectuals which threatened to undermine the old Islamic world of the guilds, the bazaars, caravanserai, the ulema and Sufi peers. Even the unalloyed boon of modern medicine in the rising West turned into something darkly ambiguous in Asia when it helped increase populations in the absence of corresponding economic growth, compounding the problem of poverty. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=743))
- Civilization came to be represented by European forms of scientific and historical knowledge and ideas of morality, public order, crime and punishment, even styles of dress. Asians everywhere came up against Europe’s new self-understanding in which it was everything Asia was not: non-despotic, increasingly urban and commercial, innovative and dynamic. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=749))
- And was Europe’s modern civilization truly ‘universal’ and ‘liberal’, as its defenders claimed, or did it discriminate against non-white races? Could one stay loyal to one’s nation while importing ideas from the same Western countries that threatened that nation’s existence and survival? ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=761))
- This is why the European subordination of Asia was not merely economic and political and military. It was also intellectual and moral and spiritual: a completely different kind of conquest than had been witnessed before, which left its victims resentful but also envious of their conquerors and, ultimately, eager to be initiated into the mysteries of their seemingly near-magical power. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=774))

- world. Certainly, there was scarcely a social or political tendency in Muslim lands – modernism, nationalism, pan-Islamism – that al-Afghani’s catholic and vital sensibility did not either ignite or stoke. Nor was there a realm of political action – anti-imperialist conspiracy, education, journalism, constitutional reform – on which he did not leave the imprint of his ideas. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=819))
- But it is clear now that he was born in 1838 in the village of Asadabad near Hamadan in north-west Persia, and educated in Tehran, the seminaries of great Shiite cities, mainly Najaf, and then in India. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=864))
- al-Afghani’s own bold and sometimes nearly heretical view of Islam, and his revolutionary messianism. But he also received an early grounding in the tradition of Persian Islamic philosophy, which, more open to innovation than its Sunni Arabic counterpart, clearly emboldened al-Afghani’s revisionist Islam.

- seemed to be made of grass,’ Ghalib wrote.17 The forebears of Jawaharlal Nehru, who had been administrative officials at the Mughal court, were among those who fled British vindictive fury in Delhi in 1857. But the Nehrus, high-caste Hindus from Kashmir, did not suffer as much as elite Muslims such as their munshi (secretary), who, Nehru relates in his autobiography, saw his family financially ruined and then partly exterminated by English troops. ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=930))
- The British tended to blame Muslims more than Hindus for the Mutiny, and after it they were more eager than ever to reduce the role of Muslims in public life. In a personal meeting with Randolph Churchill, the British Secretary of State for India in 1885, al-Afghani would confront him with reasons why Indian Muslims hated Britain: ‘You destroyed the Empire of Delhi; secondly, because you give no salaries to the imams and muezzins and keepers of the mosques. And you have resigned the Wakf property and do not repair the sacred buildings.’ ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=953))
- Even if Indian rulers were oppressive and corrupt, their reach was very limited, and they spent their ill-gotten wealth in India. The British terrorized and exploited all Indians, and exported the spoils to Britain. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=982))
- By late 1869, when al-Afghani arrived there, Istanbul was the largest city in the Muslim world and the political centre of both Arabs and Persians. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=1002))
- Under the long-standing Ottoman millet system, religious communities were allowed a high degree of self-rule; they had their own legal courts, for instance, and collected their own taxes. But the Capitulations, a system of legal privileges granted to foreigners in the Ottoman Empire, made leading European powers – the French, Russians and British, in particular – the formal protectors of ethnic minorities in the Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, the Capitulations made Europeans immune to litigation or trial in Muslim courts, no matter how severe their crime. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=1020))
- But it is true that post-Enlightenment Europe had already embarked on its extraordinary ascent; and proximity to the continent made the Ottomans as eager and anxious as the Russians to do the right thing and join the European-led march of progress. Even Egypt, nominally an Ottoman province, had started a programme of rapid internal modernization after its encounter with Napoleon in 1798. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=1045))
- the reformist Ottomans who imposed a uniform wool hat, or fez, on all Ottoman government employees, regardless of their faith, provoked severe disaffection among tradition-minded elites, especially the ulema, as the fez, chosen for its resemblance to Western hats, was not the ideal headgear for the prostrations required during prayers.

- Indeed, one of the two most enduring consequences of modernization everywhere in the Asian world would be the rise to power of new secular and Westernizing groups, whether military officers or government bureaucrats and new professionals. The other would be the backlash from those ordinary citizens who were asked to pay taxes, the religious-social elites who saw their influence threatened by the Westernizers, and the minorities who, in the face of a centralizing authority, became aware of their separate ethnic or religious identity.

- Egypt had become one of the main exporters of cotton to Britain and France by 1840, and the proceeds of this lucrative export economy enabled Muhammad Ali to build a professional conscript army and meritocratic bureaucracy.

- This nascent nationalism in Egypt was to steadily become part of a larger assertion of Arab identity vis-à-vis both the Ottomans, who increasingly privileged Turks and the Turkish language, and Europe. Islam had originated in Arab lands and also achieved its classical glory there. But for centuries its real flowering had happened elsewhere, most recently in Persia, India and Turkey. Arabs were acutely conscious of their lowly position in Muslim countries as well as the larger modern world in general. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=1365))
- Al-Afghani went on to argue that the British improved transport and communication in order to drain India’s wealth to England and facilitate trade for British merchants. Western-style schools, he argued, were meant merely to turn Indians into English-speaking cogs of the British administration. This was a sophisticated idea for its time, when Indian nationalists had barely begun to formulate it. ([Location 1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=1416))

- Al-Afghani requested that the Ottoman sultan use his power and prestige as caliph to launch a pan-Islamic front against the West, offering to be his representative in India, Afghanistan and Central Asia. His expulsion from Egypt and the defeat of liberal hopes there seem to have convinced al-Afghani of the need for a new tack. He would still experiment with different modes of resistance, often seeking to exploit European rivalries, but he would now advocate nationalisms, religious-based rather than ethnic or secular, in different Muslim countries, and would also deploy such potent invocations as pan-Islamism and holy war.

- The capitulation to foreign barbarians and the repeated violation of Japan’s long-preserved sovereignty incited great hostility, and eventually a full-scale rebellion, against the shogun. Meanwhile, the Americans pressed for more privileges, such as extraterritorial jurisdiction, and received them from an increasingly hapless old regime. Eventually, the shogunate collapsed under the strain of simultaneously appeasing foreigners and placating domestic xenophobia, and the Meiji Restoration began.

- To this end, the emperor was brought out of seclusion and exalted as a symbol of the new religion of patriotism with its own shrines and priests. Buddhism was denounced, and Shinto, an assortment of beliefs and rituals, turned into a state religion, yet another glue to use for nation-building. Students were sent abroad; Japanese delegations, many of which included Japan’s future leaders and thinkers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi, travelled to the West. Foreign experts were welcomed in every realm, from education to the military. Western dress and hairstyles were adopted and Christian missionaries tolerated. The series of painstaking efforts culminated in a constitution in 1889 that, though exalting the emperor to divine status, tried to follow Western models in other details.

There was no question now of Japan remaining subordinate to Western powers on its own territories. The treaties were revoked, and in 1902, nearly half a century after the Ottoman Empire first tried to climb on to the international stage on the back of the greatest European power, the Japanese concluded an alliance with the British Empire.

- As in Islamic countries, a literary culture and a morality derived from canonical texts gave Chinese civilization an extraordinary coherence, and made it the most influential cultural model for neighbours such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam.

- Far more long-lasting than Islam, Confucianism had underpinned Chinese government and society for two millennia; its values of ren, yi, xiao and zhong, imperfectly translated as ‘benevolence’, ‘propriety’, ‘filial piety’ and ‘loyalty’, prescribed the correct modes of behaviour and action in both private and political life.

In 1862, while the Qing were busy fighting the Taiping rebels, France overran southern Vietnam; it invaded the north of the country in 1874, and then, in 1883, announced the old kingdom of Annam in central Vietnam to be its protectorate.

- Confucianism seems like an abstract philosophy or a set of beliefs imposed upon the Chinese people by the state – something easily and voluntarily discarded. But its roots in China were deep and it provided by general consensus the religious and ideological underpinning of China’s political order. It upheld the principle of kingship; the only political community it envisaged was the universal empire, ignoring the city-state and the nation-state that were central to the Western tradition. And it prescribed the duties of the state as the maintenance of Confucian moral teachings, rather than political and economic expansion. ([Location 2465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2465))

- Kang, Liang later said, was the ‘Martin Luther’ of Confucianism. But Kang saw himself as entering something more than a scholastic or theological dispute with other Confucianists. As with Gandhi and the Bhagavadgītā, and al-Afghani and the Koran, Kang was aiming to make political reform and mass mobilization a central concern of Confucius himself, in order to make his ideas relevant to China’s present and future and give sanction to the reformist aspiration for scientific and social progress. Thus, in Kang’s reading of the Confucian classics, emancipation of women, mass education and popular elections came to appear central concerns of the sixth-century BC sage. ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2505))
- Kang was to go even further, offering a utopian vision of an inevitable universal moral community, where egoism and the habit of making hierarchies would vanish, and which would realize the Confucian idea of ren (benevolence). But this would lie in the future, after the Chinese nation had pulled itself together. For now, Kang was content to emphasize the need for institutional reform within China, for the country, as he saw it, faced a challenge from the West that was not only political but also cultural and religious. The West not only endangered the Chinese state; it also threatened Confucianism. This anxiety motivated all his campaigns for a nationwide school system or a constitutional monarchy or military academies. Perhaps influenced by the exalting of Shintoism as a state religion in Japan, Kang would even propose that Confucianism be made a state religion to combat the effect of Christianity, with local shrines turned into temples to the ‘important sage’.

- Invoking Social Darwinism again, Liang warned, ‘when a race cannot meet the exigencies of the times, it cannot endure’.59 Freedom was the absolute necessity for China, he wrote, invoking Patrick Henry’s famous words, ‘Give me Liberty or give me Death.’ ([Location 2846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2846))
- Like many Chinese thinkers of his period, Kang turned out to be less a nationalist than a utopian internationalist. As he saw it, a universal moral community of the future would transcend all distinctions of race, ethnicity and language, and would even dissolve the family – a vision that would be resurrected in China under Mao Zedong.

- In the early years of the twentieth century, Tokyo became a Mecca for nationalists from all over Asia, the centre of an expanded Asian public sphere – a process quickened by Japan’s victory over Russia in 1905.

- since the nineteenth century, American missionaries in China, mostly Protestant, had reflected the growing national confidence as they propagated the American way of life as much as Christianity. ([Location 2938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2938))
- ‘70 percent’, Liang reported in scandalized tones, ‘of the entire national wealth of America is in the hands of 200,000 rich people … How strange, how bizarre!’ ([Location 2948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2948))
- Liang began to lose his faith in people’s rights as the cure-all to autocracy as his indictment of American democracy grew. ([Location 2952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2952))
- corporate interests played an insidious role in American politics. Frequent elections made for policy short-sightedness and cheap populism. People entering democratic politics tended to be third-rate; far too many American presidents had been mediocre and uninspiring. ([Location 2953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2953))
- Democracy itself was best built from the bottom up over a long period. It couldn’t be imposed through revolution, as the fragility of democracy in France and Latin America had proved. And even in America, the liberal democratic state had been achieved with much coercion, and now, as America assumed its place in the world, it faced the danger of overcentralization. Also, imperialism was becoming more acceptable in America, as its financial and industrial power grew. ([Location 2956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2956))
- Liang was particularly appalled by the practice of lynching: ‘Had I only been told about this and not been to America myself I would not have believed that such cruel and inhuman acts could be performed in broad daylight in the twentieth century.’ ([Location 2975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2975))
- The ballot was forbidden to Chinese living in America. Schools were closed against them. They were not allowed to give evidence on the witness stand even in cases affecting their own property. They suffered open torture in public places and residential quarters. In normal times it was ‘mob-law’ that governed their person and property. The dictates of American demagogues created a veritable reign of terror for them.73 ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2980))
- The democracy and freedom that a revolution promised in China could only cause chaos rather than a nation-state capable of standing up to Western power. ‘With countrymen such as these, is it possible to practice the electoral system? … Freedom, constitutionalism, and republicanism, are all terms that mean government by the majority. But the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people are like those in San Francisco.’ ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=2999))
- It was almost inevitable that Liang would be influenced by the growing intellectual preference among Japanese for the statism embodied by Bismarck’s Germany. ([Location 3012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3012))
- The United States, despite its British heritage, still discriminated against its ethnic and racial minorities, particularly blacks and Chinese, and Native Americans. It was still a barbarous country, artistically and intellectually; and, with all its love of liberty, it had been compelled to expand the power of the federal government to fit into its international role. ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3017))
- As Liang saw it, China wasn’t faced with a choice of political systems. Such were its circumstances – a weak and ineffectual government, and a poorly educated and ethnically diverse population in a large country – that an autocracy was a necessity. A democratic republic would quickly lead to war between the military and the people, between lower and upper classes, one province and another; and revolutions would occur frequently, sapping the strength and dedication to the common good the Chinese nation needed to deal with external threats. ([Location 3021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3021))
- The fundamental change Liang sought – a centralized state that forged the Chinese people into a united citizenry – could only be achieved under a benign autocracy. ([Location 3029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3029))
- After 1905 Liang had lost the battle for influence over Chinese expatriates to Sun, who gave Chinese nationalism a racial ‘Han’ tinge, turning it into an explicitly anti-Manchu sentiment. ([Location 3036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3036))
- In his debates with Sun’s revolutionaries, Liang continued to uphold the importance of ‘broad nationalism’, as opposed to what he called ‘narrow nationalism’. He also criticized socialist ideas as inapplicable to China, which did not need the nationalization of land so much as nationalization of capital. ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3044))
- According to his original view, socialism had its roots in the terrible class inequalities and conflicts created by the laissez-faire policies followed in Western Europe after the Industrial Revolution. China had experienced no such polarization or clashes. What it needed was industrial production through capitalist methods carefully regulated by the state. This was how China could withstand the great power of American economic imperialism and hold its own in the international jungle. ([Location 3046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3046))
- Setting economic – and moral – priorities that the ‘capitalist’ heirs of Mao Zedong may well have remembered, Liang maintained that ‘Encouragement of capital is the foremost consideration; protection of labor is the second consideration.’81 And his version of capitalism included a strong social welfare component, in which the state regulated private enterprises to prevent class tensions, economic exploitation and social conflict. ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3056))
- Yuan added to these debts by taking big loans from foreign banks and governments. In a pattern familiar by now from Egypt, Iran and Turkey, the European and Japanese lenders were soon running Yuan’s economic policy, and foreigners were appointed as officials in the Chinese government. The loan money ran out, and then Yuan was forced to sell railway and mining concessions to his creditors. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3075))
- Yuan died in 1916 before he could further damage his country, and with his death even the semblance of a government disappeared; most of China shattered into innumerable fiefdoms of warlords and bandits. Much of China would remain exposed to the vagaries of warlordism until 1927 – a situation made familiar to contemporary readers in pre-Taliban Afghanistan where arms from abroad flooded the country, old elites struck deals with military strongmen, and ordinary people suffered from arbitrary taxes and confiscations of property. Mao Zedong’s native province of Hunan was particularly ravaged by rival warlords, and the bitter lessons of chaos and misrule would haunt future generations of Chinese. ([Location 3089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3089))
- As part of Liang’s deal with the Allied powers, Chinese workers and students, among them the first generation of Communist leaders such as Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping travelled to France to work and study there.

- The revolution of 1911 was a cruel failure in many ways, but it succeeded thoroughly in devastating old assumptions. Gone for ever was the sacredness of imperial dynasties, the millennia-strong prestige of the gentry and of classical learning. By destroying the old, the revolution created a new political and intellectual space in which young Chinese, radicalized by the brutal disappointments of 1911, now became visible.

- in Beijing students gathered in front of the American embassy chanting ‘Long Live President Wilson!’ and holding placards that called for the world to be made ‘safe for democracy’. Though racked by civil war, China wished to project a clear image of proud national sovereignty.

- Among the many people denied representation was the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, then known as Nguyen Ai Quoc. Ho was an indigent menial worker in Paris in 1919 when President Woodrow Wilson arrived in the city with a plan to make the world ‘safe for democracy’. Invoking their ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity, the French authorities in Vietnam had rounded up some 100,000 peasants and artisans and shipped them to the battlefields of France. In return, France was to consider self-rule for their country at some unspecified point in the future. Ho had no faith in these promises. He was disgusted by France’s practice of using poor Vietnamese as cannon fodder in its own pursuit of power and glory.

- Lenin’s Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism. Written in 1916, this pamphlet had asserted that President Wilson was as unlikely to restore Indo-china to the Vietnamese as he was to withdraw American troops from Panama. The United States, Lenin claimed, was as much of an imperialist power as Britain or Japan, greedy for resources, territory and markets, part of a capitalist world system of oppression and plunder whose inherent instability had caused the Great War. ([Location 3303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3303))
- Lenin also voluntarily renounced the special concessions Russia enjoyed in China along with other Western powers and Japan. Lenin’s actions were seen by many Asians, as Benoy Kumar Sarkar wrote, as nothing less than ‘an extraordinary and incredibly supermanic promulgation of a new international morality’. The Soviet leader had pre-empted Wilson in calling for national self-determination. ‘The new gospel’, Sarkar wrote, ‘of the political emancipation and sovereignty of all peoples is so world-sweeping or universal in its scope and so radical or fundamental in its Messianic good will that the Bolsheviks have already won the highest encomium in Chinese estimation.’ ([Location 3314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3314))
- Lenin, who followed events in China and India closely, was keenly aware of the importance to Russia of an Asia liberated from European imperialists. As he put it, ‘the outcome of the struggle depends in the last resort on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the vast majority of mankind’. ([Location 3320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3320))
- In 1920, the Bolsheviks organized the Congress of the Peoples of the East in Baku. Very soon, the Comintern was helping establish communist parties in different parts of Asia, and Soviet advisers were to help train Chinese Nationalists as well as Communists. Its unequivocally anti-imperialist stance was to make the Soviet Union attractive to many Korean, Persian, Indian, Egyptian and Chinese activists. ([Location 3325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3325))
- Indeed, Wilson, who presided over a serious erosion of civil liberties during the war at home, was no stranger to moral compromises in foreign policy. He supported, for instance, China’s militarist president Yuan Shikai against Sun Yat-sen in 1913 in the hope that the dictator in Beijing, however brutal, would not close America’s ‘Open Door’ to China. His anti-imperialism rested on a fine distinction that colonized peoples could not recognize. He regarded European imperialism as a matter of physical occupation of far-off lands and spheres of influence, and deplored it as such. Proposing the Open Door, he did not see that free trade, the third of his Fourteen Points, could be seen as equally oppressive by economically disadvantaged peoples. ([Location 3353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3353))
- For Woodrow Wilson was, in many ways, an unlikely hero in the alleys of Cairo, Delhi and Canton. Piously Presbyterian, and a helpless Anglophile (he had courted his wife with quotes from Bagehot and Burke), he had hoped that the United States in the Philippines and Puerto Rico would follow the British tradition of instructing ‘less civilized’ peoples into law and order.20 ‘After all, they are children and we are men in these deep matters of government and justice.’21 A Southerner, Wilson also shared the reflexive racism of many of his class and generation (and many jokes about ‘darkies’). ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3364))
- Wilson’s rhetoric about self-determination was aimed at the European peoples – Poles, Romanians, Czechs, Serbians – that were part of the German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Concerned with setting up the League of Nations, which he hoped would provide a framework for collective security and enduring peace in Europe, Wilson had little interest in persuading Britain and France to renounce their colonial possessions in Asia and Africa.

- Defeated over Germany, which France and Britain sought to utterly humiliate, Wilson barely put up a fight when it came to the rights of non-European peoples, many of whom did not get a hearing at the conference. Even the Japanese, who arrived at the conference with a proper imperialist pedigree, were scornfully disregarded. They were seated at the far end of the long table, facing the representatives of Guatemala and Ecuador. But it wasn’t the physical distance from where the Great Powers huddled that prompted Clemenceau to complain of not being able to hear the Japanese delegate Makino Nobuaki ([Location 3398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=3398))
- This raillery did not portend well for the most important item on the Japanese agenda: the enshrinement of the equality of nations – racial equality – in the League of Nations’ constitution. The Japanese hoped that this would make the Californian government, for instance, permit Japanese immigration and unsegregated schools, and force the French in Indo-china to remove unfair restrictions on Japanese imports.

However, confronted with the American principle that ‘all men are created equal’, Lord Balfour, soon to be famous for his work on Palestine, flatly asserted his disbelief that ‘a man of Central Africa was created equal to a European’. 26 In the end, Makino put the racial equality issue to a vote – and won. But President Wilson, in an act remembered for decades by Japanese nationalists, ruled that the majority vote was annulled by the fact that there were some strong objectors to the clause.

- describing the onset of a hard-line political ideology in China. In July 1919, Russian revolutionaries, sensing an opportunity in the Western betrayal, unilaterally renounced their country’s unequal treaties with China, declaring that if the Chinese nation desires to become free like the Russian people, and to escape the destiny prescribed for it at Versailles in order to transform it into a second Korea or a second India, it should understand that its only allies and brothers in the struggle for liberty are the Russian worker and peasant and the Red Army of Russia.51 In less than two years, the Chinese Communist Party would be formed in Shanghai, gathering disaffected young radicals and giving them a clear cause and a set of ideas free of the baggage of the past. Mao Zedong was among the young Chinese who stumbled out of the events of 1919 into an absolute scepticism of Western motives and policies and a broader awareness of the political possibilities available to subjugated peoples.

- The discrediting of President Wilson, Nehru wrote, had raised ‘the spectre of communism’ over Asia. Like Ho Chi Minh, Mao was finding that only communism could help bring true sovereignty to China. He wrote to his friends in France to say he was through with all other ideas and was devoting himself to the ‘Russian Revolution’. The idea of revolution re-emerged in China after the failure of 1911, this time with a sharper target – Western imperialism – in sight.

The fundamental characteristics of this civilization are benevolence, justice and morality: This civilization makes people respect, not fear, it. Such a civilization is, in the language of the Ancients, the rule of Right or the Kingly Way. One may say, therefore, that Oriental civilization is one of the rules of Right. Since the development of European materialistic civilization and the cult of Might, the morality of the world has been on the decline. Even in Asia, morality in several countries has degenerated.

- In particular, European insistence that Japan return some of its gains from its war with China in 1895 angered Sohō. American immigration laws discriminating against Japanese workers in 1913 and 1920 further alienated Sohō from his Western liberal inspirations. By the 1930s, he had settled, like many Japanese, into resentment of the West.

- Working with the logic that Japan’s self-interest was also Asia’s, Sohō had little trouble rationalizing Japan’s full-scale invasion of China in 1937. Like many Japanese intellectuals at the time, he believed that Japan had to face down expansionist Soviet Communism in China. American oil embargoes, which threatened to cripple Japan’s economy, also fitted neatly into a pattern of unappeasable Western hostility. ‘Americans act,’ he suggested, ‘as if they are the highest authority for judging the rest of the world – their actions manifest the greatest arrogance.’ ([Location 4175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4175))

- The most famous Confucian of the 1920s and 1930s was Liang Shuming, who envisioned Gandhian-style self-sufficient and moral village communities across China.

- In 1938, Mao Zedong, another rural activist, visited Liang and they held long discussions about Liang’s work. Mao himself never seems to have shaken off his early Confucian moralism despite his public and virulent criticism of Confucianism. His utopian socialism carried more than a tinge of Kang Youwei’s fantasy of a harmonious world. Speaking in 1949, Mao was convinced that ‘Western bourgeois civilization, bourgeois democracy and the plan for a bourgeois republic have all gone bankrupt in the eyes of the Chinese people’. A ‘people’s republic’, he asserted, would now ‘abolish classes and enter a world of Great Harmony’ – one that Kang Youwei ‘did not and could not find the way to achieve’.

- Mao believed that the moral and spiritual transformation of individuals and collective virtuous action were the prerequisites for larger social and political changes. In the end, Mao succeeded where Liang Qichao failed in reviving and unifying China around a shared ethic. During their first three decades in power, the Chinese Communists tried to root out Confucianism from China, denouncing it as ‘feudal’ and reactionary. But as the appeal of communism has declined, party officials have returned to upholding Confucianism. Chinese culture, Mao insisted, should have its own form, its ‘own national form’.30 And the Chinese government seems to be striving towards this in a wholly unexpected way as it promotes Chinese culture abroad through the building of Confucius Institutes – Chinese versions of the Alliance Française and Goethe-Institut. Chinese leaders have also taken to using words like ‘harmonious society’ to burnish their credentials as mitigators of social and economic inequality.

- While in Europe Iqbal also became an admirer of Nietzsche – specifically of the latter’s idea of the Superman, of self-creation and self-assertion – even as he became hyperconscious of his Muslim identity and increasingly convinced that the progress of Indian Muslims lay not in imitating Europe but in reforming and reviving the religious community they had been born into. To this end, he began to exalt Nietzschean-style masculine vigour and the great Islamic past in his writings. Like many Islamic modernists who harked back to classical Islam, Iqbal became a critic of Sufism and the mystical and folk traditions within Islam that advocate the rejection of the ego and the self, and even of Islamic sects like the Ahmadi. Europe, he believed, would destroy itself through excessive materialism; Islam, which concealed the principle of true individualism, would then emerge as a saviour of humanity.

- radical atheists like Mao Zedong had little chance of flourishing in Islamic societies. And even secular nationalist parties like the Baath in Iraq and Syria could not ignore the mobilizing power of Islam. ([Location 4435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4435))
- The revolutions that succeeded in Muslim countries were launched in the name of Islam not Marx or Paine. Liberalism, defined in the broadest sense, had a tenuous hold in the Muslim world. ([Location 4437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4437))

- The Egyptians and Indian Muslims trying to overcome the British, the Syrians struggling against the French, the Iranians resisting Anglo-Russian designs on their country, the Indonesians ranged against the Dutch, and even the Turks expelling the Greeks from Anatolia in 1922 borrowed from the armoury of Western ideas and institutions.

- all of these attempts are futile because they do not deal with the foundation of the problem, they do not attack the vast and extensive roots of the problem which lie buried beneath European soil.

- The West is no longer the source of good as well as bad things, deep in material benefits but shallow in spiritual matters; it has to be rejected in toto.

- The pressures on China in the early twentieth century were, if anything, greater than those suffered by the doddering Ottoman Empire. The collapse of the Qing dynasty, the Japanese invasion of the country, and protracted civil war between Sun Yat-sen’s Guomindang and the Chinese Communist Party made it imperative, even from a perspective other than the Social Darwinian one, for China to form a strong nation-state or perish. In this, it succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of its founders, and, as in Turkey, the selective repudiation of the past and the appropriation of Western ideologies like secular nationalism and communism were crucial.

- Chinese schoolchildren still learn about Western vandalism during the Opium War in great detail, and the indoctrination began well before the Communists seized power: ‘The Opium War’, one history textbook of the late 1920s declared, ‘branded the iron hoofprint of imperialism on the bodies of our people.’ ([Location 4901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4901))
- It was left to Mao to redefine the conflict as a ‘national war against imperialism’;70 he also used it to explain why neither revolution nor nation-building was a dinner party. ‘In the face of such enemies,’ he declared in 1951, ‘the Chinese revolution cannot be other than protracted and ruthless.’ ([Location 4904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4904))
- In 1990, a year after the Chinese army killed unarmed protestors near Tiananmen Square, a commemorative symposium organized by Communist authorities focused on evil foreigners, describing the Opium War as a plot to ‘enslave our people, steal our wealth and turn a great nation that had been independent for thousands of years into a semi-feudal semi-colony’.

- the humiliations at the Paris Peace Conference, and the subsequent May Fourth Movement which exalted Western thought and violently repudiated Confucianism, enshrined Marxism-Leninism as the main ideological outlook of Chinese thinkers and revolutionaries.

- Eventually, however, through a series of agrarian revolutions – land redistribution, local government by peasants – the Communists under Mao welded Chinese peasants into a revolutionary army, and made their victory in 1949 possible. ([Location 4944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4944))
- Sticking to textbook Marxism, however, the Communists misleadingly characterized the Chinese past as ‘feudal’: a built-in bias towards urban industrial growth and against agrarian life led to a condescending attitude towards the mass of Chinese peasants; ‘poor and blank’, as Mao called them. And the search for class enemies led to campaigns of mass killings in the 1930s and 1940s in the remote country areas into which the Communists had been forced by their rivals, the Nationalists and the Japanese.

- Organizationally, however, communism worked much better than the warmed-over Confucianism of the Nationalists. Eventually it helped Mao build up a mass base for the CCP in the countryside. Unlike his rivals, Mao himself provided a compelling narrative of China to the Chinese masses. ([Location 4952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4952))
- its century-long suspicion of Western powers was confirmed when the United States successfully isolated China, arming Nationalist Taiwan and giving the small island China’s seat at the United Nations. ([Location 4967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4967))
- Wanting China to catch up with the West as quickly as possible, Mao Zedong set fantasy targets: he asked his compatriots in the mid-1950s, for instance, to match Britain’s industrial production in fifteen years. The blunders resulted in a series of catastrophes which brought China to its knees. Food shortages followed by famine killed more than 30 million people between 1959 and 1961. Mao’s Cultural Revolution, which aimed, initially at least, to start the Chinese revolution afresh in the 1960s degenerated into civil war. ([Location 4972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4972))
- In retrospect, communism in China seems more and more to have been an effective ideology for mobilizing and unifying the Chinese masses. Chinese activists in the early twentieth century tried and failed to create a unified nation-state that could launch China’s search for wealth and power in the modern world. It was the Communists who succeeded in creating a broad-based participatory nationalism that included peasants as well as urban workers. They created a new army, giving a new sense of purpose and energy to demoralized peasants, and went on to build a powerful state bureaucracy that combined party and administrative officials to reach down into every urban neighbourhood and village. ([Location 4978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=4978))
- though communism led to a calamitous misinterpretation of Chinese realities and has lost its intellectual appeal, the Chinese Communist Party seems in little danger of going the way of its East European and Russian counterparts. It no longer insists on doctrinal orthodoxy – indeed it has tried to replace communism with Confucian notions of the ‘harmonious society’ – but it remains unchallenged in its role as the sole guarantor of China’s stability, security and growing prosperity.

- ‘We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy,’ Mao promised in 1949. ‘Ours will,’ he warned, ‘no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation.’ In less than six decades, history seems to have fulfilled Mao’s hopes.

- As previous pages have shown, the idea of individual rights was never deeply rooted in even the most liberal strains of modern Chinese thought, which always had a collectivist orientation. ([Location 5004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=5004))
- contemporary China, which the West increasingly accuses of being mercantilist in its economic policies, and where an all-powerful state is quick to suppress, often brutally, freedom of expression and other civil rights if they seem to be undermining the all-important national tasks of high economic growth and political stability. ([Location 5016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0071W4UH4&location=5016))
- no convincingly universalist response exists today to Western ideas of politics and economy, even though these seem increasingly febrile and dangerously unsuitable in large parts of the world. Gandhi, their most rigorous critic, is a forgotten figure within India today. Marxism-Leninism lies discredited and, though China’s rulers increasingly make gestures towards Confucian notions of harmony, China’s own legacy of ethical politics and socio-economic theory remains largely unexplored.
