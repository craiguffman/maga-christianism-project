# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  643

The idea that some sacraments give a “character” to those who receive them, and that this character is something other than grace, was too solidly established in Latin theology for Aquinas to ignore it.  The postulate of a character had, to a large extent, grown out of the reception of Augustine’s anti-Donatist reflections on the non-repetition of baptism.  The medieval theology on this topic also owes much to certain passages of The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius.  p. 349
