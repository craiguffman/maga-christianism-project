For the Augustinian line which leads to Duns Scotus will is the predominant power which makes man man, and God God. God is first of all will and only secondarily intellect. And will is the center of manâ€™s personality, and intellect is secondary. The world is originally created by will and is for this reason irrational and to be taken empirically. On a secondary level it is intellectually ordered. But this order is never final and cannot be taken in by us in deductive terms.   In the modern world this same conflict goes on, when thinkers like Henri Bergson and Brand Blanshard of Yale present contrasting systems in terms of the will and intellect.  p. 142
