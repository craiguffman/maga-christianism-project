# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  647

Aquinas recognizes that the character belongs to the level of res et sacramentum, which is identified by contemporary theologians as the ecclesial level of sacramental analysis.  It thus provides a satisfactory explanation of how one remains a member of the Church even when one refuses the full grace of membership.  It explains how actions of those marked by the character can be recognized as acts of the Church, and therefore how sacraments given and received even by sinners can be true sacraments.  p. 350
