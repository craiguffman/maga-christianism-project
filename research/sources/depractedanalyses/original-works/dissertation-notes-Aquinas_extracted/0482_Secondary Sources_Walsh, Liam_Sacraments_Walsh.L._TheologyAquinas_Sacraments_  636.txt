# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  636

The first thing to be said about the sign that is sacrament is that it is made up of things that touches the senses....The senses are the door to human knowing, and Aquinas wants to inject the sense-grounded realism of his epistemology into his theology of sacrament.  If there is a bit of Aristotelian intellectualism peeping through what he says, there is also a hint of Platonism in the way he regards bodily-perceived images as giving access to the spiritual reality that is active in sacraments.  His interest is in the images generated by sense impressions.  That is clear from the very liturgical parallel that he draws between Scripture and sacrament: both operate by sense images, evoked by the reading of words in one case and by the touch of things in the other.  p. 336  [THIS COULD BE BEHIND HOOKERâ€™S PLATONISTIC ELEMENTS, TOO]
