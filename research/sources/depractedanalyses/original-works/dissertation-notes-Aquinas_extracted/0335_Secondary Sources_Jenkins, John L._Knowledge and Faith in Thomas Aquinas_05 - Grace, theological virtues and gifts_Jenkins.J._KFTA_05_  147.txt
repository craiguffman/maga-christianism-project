The miraculous event, though not in accord with the UNO, is natural in that it accords with the most universal natural order (MUNO), the order of all creatures to the will of God.

As he writes elsewhere, the causes of the UNO are to be understood as secondary causes of God, but causes by which God is by no means constrained: Because [God] is not subject to the order of secondary causes, but this order is subject to Him (as proceeding from Him not by necessity of nature, but by freedom of the will - for He could have established another order of things) ... [God] can also act apart from this established order, when He wills.40 The causes of the UNO are secondary causes through which God normally achieves His effects in the world.
