# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  640

[Aquinas] allows that a principal cause cannot be a sign of its own effect. But an instrumental cause can, provided it has some visibility.  An instrumental cause is already an effect of the principal cause that is acting upon it and through it.  In its visibility as instrument, as something seen to be acting under the movement of a principal cause, it can be a sign of its principal cause and of the proper effect of its action.  This, says Aquinas, is the meaning of the adage widely used in his day.... - they do what they signify.  Sacraments are only causes when they are signifying the God who is working through them. pp. 345-6
