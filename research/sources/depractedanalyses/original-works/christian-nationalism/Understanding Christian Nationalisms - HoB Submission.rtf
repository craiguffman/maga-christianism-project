In\expnd16\expndtw80  \expnd0\expndtw0 contrast, the "prophetic" version contrasts America's deeds and structures with our ideals and calls for reform.

The discourse promotes a liberal, colorblind ethic. However, it construes anyone who does not live according to its ethnotradition as an outsider. Echoing the Protestant work ethic, which held that hard work was evidence of one's divine election, it construes those constrained by generational poverty, chronic crime, or substandard educational opportunities as irresponsibly rejecting Judeo-Christian norms of rugged individualism, self-sufficiency, and traditional family values. They may be citizens, but they are not legitimate compatriots because they fail to embody Judeo-Christian values.
