### Highlights

- analyze ethnicity “without groups,” to go “beyond identity,” and to conceive of ethnicity as a perspective on the world, rather than a thing in the world. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=86))
- the return of inequality, the return of biology, and the return of the sacred. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=92))
- the chapter considers the very different ways in which citizenship, gender, and ethnicity (broadly understood to include race as well as certain forms of religion) work to generate and sustain inequality. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=110))
- three general processes through which categories of difference enter into the making and remaking of inequality: the allocation of persons to positions, the social production of persons, and the social definition of positions. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=112))
- the social sciences came to construe diversity through the prism of culture rather than nature. A reflexive antibiologism became central to the disciplinary identity of sociologists in particular. Most sociologists have been uninterested in the interface between the social and the biological, and many have been hostile to any attempt to show the bearing of biology on social life, seeing “biology” and “the social” as “locked in an explanatory zero-sum game” ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=116))
- The Human Genome Project was celebrated for highlighting species-wide genetic commonality, but the subsequent flood of relatively inexpensive genomic data has occasioned intensified exploration of between-group genetic differences. These differences have been explicitly linked to folk understandings of race, giving new respectability to the claim that social understandings of race have a biological foundation. The cultural authority of genomics has transformed understandings and practices of race and ethnicity in biomedical research, forensic investigation, and ancestry testing; it has informed new kinds of political claims; and it has challenged seemingly settled constructivist theories of race and ethnicity. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=129))
- Secularization has been understood in different ways by different theorists, but it generally designates one or more of three distinct processes: the differentiation of religion from other spheres of social life; the decline of religious belief or practice; or the privatization of religion. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=147))
- The resurgence of public religion has major implications for how we understand diversity, multiculturalism, and the politics of difference. That societies worldwide are becoming more diverse and pluralistic is a truism, but how they are becoming more diverse is seldom examined. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=155))
- Yet the most vexed and contentious forms of diversity—what some political theorists have called “deep diversity”—are increasingly, and fundamentally, grounded in religious worldviews and ways of life. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=158))
- Both religion and language are ways of identifying oneself and others, and of construing sameness and difference. In the language of Pierre Bourdieu, both are basic principles of vision and division of the social world. Both divide the world, in popular understandings, into bounded and largely self-reproducing communities. And claims are made in the name of both kinds of communities for recognition, resources, and reproduction. In all these respects, language and religion are both similar to ethnicity and nationalism and similarly intertwined with them. Language or religion or both together are central to most ethnic and national identifications, and they frequently serve as key emblems or symbols of such identifications. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=164))
- religion has tended to displace language as the most heatedly contested terrain of the politics of cultural difference. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=182))
- this chapter identifies and critically analyzes four ways of studying the relation between religion and nationalism. The first is to treat religion and nationalism, along with ethnicity and race, as analogous phenomena. The second is to specify ways in which religion helps explain things about nationalism: its origin, its power, or its distinctive character in particular cases. The third is to treat religion as part of nationalism and to specify modes of interpenetration and intertwining. And the fourth is to posit a distinctively religious form of nationalism. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=188))
- Notwithstanding repeated assertions of its obsolescence, the nation-state remains the decisive instance of belonging even in a rapidly globalizing world; and struggles over belonging in and to the nation-state remain the most consequential form of membership politics. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=212))
- Chapter 7 makes the case for a “single modernity” perspective on ethnicity and nationalism. Such a perspective brings into focus the global, interconnected nature of the processes—socioeconomic, political, and cultural—that have generated and sustained nationalism, ethnicity, race, and related categories as basic forms of cultural understanding, social organization, and political claims-making. And it highlights the worldwide diffusion of a set of rhetorical idioms, organizational forms, and political templates that provide the cultural and institutional materials for various forms of nationalism and politicized ethnicity. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=238))
- The intertwined idioms of nationhood, peoplehood, and citizenship—like the idioms of race, religion, rights, and revolution—are eminently flexible and adaptable. They can be used to legitimize a polity but also to challenge its legitimacy, to demand a new polity, or to claim autonomy or resources within an existing polity. And the abstract category of nationhood or peoplehood can be imagined in a variety of ways: the nation can be understood to be grounded in citizenship, history, language, descent, race, religion, way of life, or shared political experience. A “single modernity” perspective can make sense of both the core elements of the “package” and the flexible adaptability and chronic contestation of its component ideas and organizational forms. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=247))
- RELIGION AND NATIONALISM have long been contested terms. On almost any understanding, both designate large and multidimensional fields of phenomena. Given the lack of agreement on what we are talking about when we talk about religion or nationalism, it is no surprise that one encounters seemingly antithetical assertions about the relation between the two— ([Location 2215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2215))
- More recently, Anthony Smith has provided a more sophisticated, and more sympathetic, account of nationalism as a “new religion of the people”—a religion as “binding, ritually repetitive, and collectively enthusing” as any other. According to Smith, nationalism is a religion both in a substantive sense, insofar as it entails a quest for a kind of this-worldly collective “salvation,” and in a functional sense, insofar as it involves a “system of beliefs and practices that distinguishes the sacred from the profane and unites its adherents in a single moral community of the faithful.” In this new religion, which both “parallels and competes with traditional religions,” authenticity is the functional equivalent of sanctity; patriotic heroes and national geniuses, who embody and exemplify this authenticity and sacrifice themselves for the community, are the equivalent of prophets and messiah-saviors; and posterity, in which their legendary deeds live on, is the equivalent of the afterlife. It is this religious quality of nationalism, on Smith’s account, that explains the durability and emotional potency of national identities and the “scope, depth, and intensity of the feelings and loyalties that nations and nationalism so often evoke” (2003: 4–5, 15, 26, 40–42). ([Location 2242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2242))
- I briefly discuss three ways of considering religion and nationalism (and ethnicity as well) under more encompassing conceptual rubrics: as a mode of identification, a mode of social organization, and a way of framing political claims. ([Location 2255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2255))
- Ethnicity and nationalism have been characterized as basic sources and forms of social and cultural identification. As such, they are ways of identifying oneself and others, of construing sameness and difference, and of situating and placing oneself in relation to others. Understood as perspectives on the world rather than things in the world, they are ways of understanding and identifying oneself, making sense of one’s problems and predicaments, identifying one’s interests, and orienting one’s actions (Brubaker 2004). Religion too can be understood in this manner. As a principle of vision and division of the social world, to use Bourdieu’s phrase, religion provides a way of identifying and naming fundamental social groups, a powerful framework for imagining community, and a set of schemas, templates, and metaphors for making sense of the social world (and of course the supramundane world as well).3 ([Location 2257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2257))
- Second, like ethnicity and nationalism, religion can be understood as a mode of social organization, a way of framing, channeling, and organizing social relations. I’m not referring here to churches, ethnic associations, or nationalist organizations per se. I’m referring rather to the ways religion, ethnicity, and nationality can serve as more or less pervasive axes of social segmentation in heterogeneous societies, even without territorial concentration along religious, ethnic, or national lines. ([Location 2264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2264))
- Even outside such parallel institutional worlds, though more often in conjunction with them, religion, ethnicity, and nationality can channel informal social relations in ways that generate and sustain social segmentation. The key mechanism here is religious or ethnic endogamy, whether more or less deliberately pursued from the inside or imposed from the outside.5 Religious injunctions against intermarriage, together with clerical control or influence over marriage, have often helped reproduce socioreligious segmentation. This, in turn, has helped reproduce religious, ethnic, and national communities over the long run and has worked to prevent their dissolution through assimilation (Smith 1986: 123). ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2273))
- Third, from a political point of view, claims made in the name of religion—or in the name of particular religious groups—can be considered alongside claims made in the name of ethnicity, race, or nationhood. The similarities are particularly striking insofar as claims are made for economic resources, political representation, symbolic recognition, or cultural reproduction (the last by means of institutional or territorial autonomy, where institutional autonomy involves control of one’s own agencies of socialization, crucially schools). These claims are part of the general phenomenon of politicized ethnicity, broadly understood as encompassing claims made on the basis of ethnoreligious, ethnonational, ethnoracial, ethnoregional, or otherwise ethnocultural identifications, which have proliferated in both the developed and the developing world in the past half-century.6 Widening the analytical lens still further, claims made in the name of religious communities can fruitfully be seen as part of a very general pattern of the politicization of culture and the culturalization of politics.7 ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2278))
- In this perspective, religion figures as a way of identifying “groups” or political claimants, not as a distinctive way of specifying the content of political claims. Of course, politicized religion involves not only claims for resources, representation, recognition, or reproduction; it also involves claims to restructure public life in accordance with religious principles. ([Location 2287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2287))
- Scholars have traced the influence of Calvinism on Dutch and English nationalism (Gorski 2000b; ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2301))
- One important cluster of work has shown how religious motifs, narratives, and symbols were transposed into the political domain and used to construct the first recognizably nationalist (or at least proto-nationalist) claims. Much of this work has focused on the motif of chosenness, or what Smith (2003) calls the “myth of ethnic election.”8 This and associated motifs, narratives, and symbols from the Hebrew Bible were central to political rhetoric and iconography in the Netherlands (Schama 1988: 93–125; Gorski 2000b) and England (Hill 1993) during the tumultuous and tightly interlinked religious and political struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Gorski has argued forcefully that this early modern “Mosaic moment” was distinctively nationalist in scope and content. Smith now agrees that this period saw the birth of movements and programs that he calls “covenantal nationalisms” (2008: chapter 5).9 Chosenness and other religious motifs and symbols, he argues, are “deep cultural resources” that continue to provide the “basic cultural and ideological building blocks for nationalists” (2003: 254–255; see also Hutchison and Lehmann 1994). ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2306))
- Scholars have suggested, for example, that the Protestant Reformation and the broader process of “confessionalization” contributed to the development of nationalism in three ways: by generating new modes of imagining and constructing social and political relationships, promoting literacy in and standardization of vernacular languages, and bringing polity and culture into tighter alignment. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2317))
- This line of argument emphasizes the egalitarian potential inherent in the notion of the priesthood of all believers, the individualism involved in the emphasis on the direct study of scripture, and the direct and unmediated relationship between individuals and God. These new ways of imagining religious community have a striking affinity with understandings of “the nation” as an internally undifferentiated, egalitarian community to which individuals belong directly and immediately.10 Practices of congregational self-rule in sectarian Protestantism, moreover, furnished models for democratic and national self-rule (Calhoun 1997: 72). A complementary argument about new modes of imagining community focuses on the long-term trajectory of Christianity, furthered by though not originating in Protestantism. Drawing on Gauchet (1997) and Baker (1994), for example, Bell (2001: 24–26) has argued that the intensification of the perceived gap between human and divine allowed the social world to be conceived in terms of its own autonomous laws. New understandings of nation—along with related foundational notions, including society, patrie, civilization, and public—emerged in this context. ([Location 2321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2321))
- Catholic as well as Protestant regions and involved “the emergence of three doctrinally, liturgically, and organizationally distinct ‘confessions’ [Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism], and their gradual imposition on an often passive population” (Gorski 2000a: 152). Confessionalization substantially tightened the relation between political organization and religious belief and practice. In so doing it provided a model for and a matrix of the congruence between culture and polity that is at the core of nationalism. ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2340))
- Confessionalization involved the fusion of politics and religion through the emergence of territorial churches that were subordinated (more or less fully and explicitly) to secular political control. Intensified religious discipline and new forms of social control heightened pressures for conformity. The persecution of dissent and consequent waves of refugees generated an “unmixing of confessions” that anticipated the later ethnic and nationalist “unmixing of peoples” (Gorski 2000a: 157–158). Rulers’ explicit concern with the religious homogeneity of their subjects marked a sharp departure from the generic prenationalist condition portrayed in stylized fashion by Gellner (1994: 62) in which rulers “were interested in the tribute and labour potential of their subjects, not in their culture.” Rulers were now very much interested in the culture of their subjects, though not in their language. The state-led cultural homogenization that was licensed by the formula cuius regio, eius religio provided a model for later, expressly nationalist modes of statist national homogenization. ([Location 2344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2344))
- Nationalism centrally involves a distinctive organization of sameness and difference: nationalist ideology demands—and nationalist social, political, and cultural processes tend to generate—cultural homogeneity within political units and cultural heterogeneity between them. The territorialization and pluralization of religion entailed by the process of confessionalization and codified in settlements such as the 1555 Peace of Augsburg and the 1648 Peace of Westphalia institutionalized and legitimated this distinctive pattern.13 Religious homogeneity—a model for (and often a component of) national cultural homogeneity—was produced and legitimized on the level of the individual polity, while religious pluralism was institutionalized within the wider state system. More broadly, the territorialization and pluralization of religion entailed by the process of confessionalization placed religion “in a competitive, comparative field,” in Anderson’s phrase (1991: 17). The emergence of such a field—replacing the single vast field of medieval Christendom—made it easier to imagine a world of distinct, bounded nations. ([Location 2352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2352))
- In a second kind of intertwining, religion does not necessarily define the boundaries of the nation, but it supplies myths, metaphors, and symbols that are central to the discursive or iconic representation of the nation. This theme has been developed most fully in the work of Smith (1986, 2003, 2008). The question that religious resources help answer in this case is not necessarily “Who belongs?” but rather “Who are we?” and “What is distinctive about us as a people, in terms of our history, character, identity, mission, or destiny?” ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2379))
- If one interprets nationalist discourse broadly as embracing not only the discourse that accompanies and informs nationalist movements or specific forms of nationalist politics but any form of public or private talk about particular “nations” or countries, then this offers a broad and fertile terrain for studying the connection between religion and nationalism. ([Location 2384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2384))
- Historically, religious language and imagery have deeply informed and infused ways of thinking and talking about America and “Americanism,” about the origins of the nation, its mission, its destiny, its role in the world, the “righteousness” of its causes, and the “evil” of its enemies. America has been represented as a nation uniquely blessed by God, indeed chosen by God for a “redemptive” role in the world and ordained to serve as a “New Israel,” whose providential mission is to serve in exemplary fashion as a “beacon unto the nations” or, in its interventionist Wilsonian form, to take the lead in recasting and regenerating the world order, to “lead the world in the assertion of the rights of peoples and the rights of free nations” (Woodrow Wilson, quoted in Stephanson 1995: 117). ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2389))
- When reference is made today to America’s distinctive mission in the world, is this evidence of the religious nature of American nationalism? Or, if one were to trace the rhetoric of mission from the New England colonies of the seventeenth century through the present, would one be more struck by the progressive secularization of that rhetoric? The specifically religious resonance or force of the rhetoric of national mission would seem to be much weaker today than in the New England colonies or seventeenth-century Netherlands. In the peroration to the Protestant Ethic, Weber (1958) spoke of victorious capitalism no longer needing the support of religion. Whatever the role of religion in the origins of nationalism, we might well say the same thing about victorious nationalism today (cf. Greenfeld 1992: 77). ([Location 2417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2417))
- In the Christian context, nationalization is in part a matter of what might more precisely be called the “étatization” of religion, through which states have sought to establish control over church affairs, appointments, and property. In the realm of Orthodox Christianity, especially in southeastern Europe, the nationalization of Christianity involved the fragmentation of Eastern Christendom into a series of autocephalous national churches, which provided a key institutional framework for nationalist movements and promoted a strong symbiosis of religious and national traditions. The nationalization of religion is also a matter of the varying cultural inflections of religious thought and practice in different state and national contexts. This cultural inflection of religious practice has been fostered by the fact that Christianity, unlike Islam, has never been tied to a unifying sacred language but has been from the start a “religion of translation” (Hastings 1997: 194). Although universalistic tendencies in Islam have been stronger than those in Christianity, scholars have studied the nationalization of Islam as well, showing how Islam has accommodated itself to—and been inflected by—differing national and state contexts (Lapidus 2001). ([Location 2443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2443))
- The fourth and final way of analyzing the connection between religion and nationalism involves the claim that religious nationalism is a distinctive kind of nationalism. The claim is not simply that nationalist rhetoric may be suffused with religious imagery or that nationalist claims may be framed and formulated in religious or religiously tinged language. This is indisputably true. It is not simply a claim about a religio-national symbiosis or interpenetration, which no doubt often exists. The argument I want to examine here concerns not the rhetorical form of nationalist claims, or the language or imagery used to frame them, but the content of those claims. It is an argument that there is a distinctively religious type of nationalist program that represents a distinct alternative to secular nationalism. ([Location 2453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2453))
- The claim for a distinctively religious form of nationalism has been most fully articulated by Roger Friedland (2002; see also Juergensmeyer 1993). Friedland defines nationalism in statist terms. He characterizes nationalism as “a state-centered form of collective subject formation”; as “a program for the co-constitution of the state and the territorially bounded population in whose name it speaks”; and as “a set of discursive practices by which the territorial identity of a state and… ([Location 2459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2459))
- This statist definition allows Friedland to conceptualize religious nationalism as a particular type of nationalism. Nationalism is understood as a form with variable content. The form prescribes the “joining of state, territoriality, and culture” (2002: 387) but does not specify how they are to be joined. It leaves open the content of state-centered collective subject formation, the content of the discursive practices through which the territorial identity of a state and the cultural identity of a people are “constituted as a singular fact.” Religion provides… ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2464))
- Religion is able to do so, on Friedland’s account, because it provides “models of authority” and “imaginations of an ordering power” (2002: 390). Religion is a “totalizing order capable of regulating every aspect of life” (390)—though Friedland acknowledges that this is less true of Christianity, given its origins as a stateless faith. Religious nationalism joins state, territory, and culture primarily by focusing on family, gender, and sexuality: by defending the family’s powers of social reproduction and moral socialization against economic and cultural forces that… ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2469))
- This is a sophisticated and interesting argument. It usefully focuses attention on the distinctively religious content of programs for the ordering and regulating of public and private life rather than on the religious inflection of political… ([Location 2475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2475))
- In Northern Ireland, for example, political rhetoric is often inflected by religious motifs, images, and symbols, and religion is the key diacritical marker that defines the parties to the conflict. Yet the conflict is not “about” religion; no major claims are made about ordering and regulating public life according to religious principles. This is a classical nationalist… ([Location 2478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2478))
- But the fact that Islamist movements seek to gain or influence the exercise of power within particular nation-states does not make them nationalist (Arjomand 1994; Asad 2003: chapter 6). ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2500))
- Nationalism is a useful concept only if it is not overstretched. If the concept is not to lose its discriminating power, it must be limited to forms of politics, ideology, or discourse that involve a central orientation to “the nation”; it cannot be extended to encompass all forms of politics that work in and through nation-states (cf. Smith 1991: 74). There is no compelling reason to speak of “nationalism” unless the imagined community of the nation is widely understood as a primary focus of value, source of legitimacy, object of loyalty, and basis of identity. But the nation is not understood in this way by most Islamist movements. This points to the limits of Friedland’s state-centered understanding of nationalism. If Islamism is a form of nationalism, it is nationalism without a central role for “the nation.” ([Location 2501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2501))
- A key distinguishing feature of nation as an imagined community—and of nationalism as an ideology—is that any given nation is imagined as limited, as just one among many other such nations (Anderson 1991: 7). The social ontology of nationalism is in this sense “polycentric” or “pluralist” (Smith 1983:158–159, 170–171). ([Location 2514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2514))
- A secularist bias in the study of nationalism, like the secularist bias in many other domains of social science, long obscured interesting connections and affinities between religion and nationalism. Long-dominant modernizationist arguments, emphasizing socioeconomic modernity (Gellner 1983; Deutsch 1953), political modernity (Breuilly 1994; Tilly 1996; Hechter 2000), or cultural modernity (Anderson 1991), neglected religion or saw it as superseded by nationalism. The paradigmatic instances addressed in the literature were European nationalisms between the late eighteenth and early twentieth century; this truncated range of cases marginalized others—from early modern Europe, South Asia, or the Middle East, for example—in which religion was more obviously central. A widely shared understanding of the modern nation-state—an understanding at once normative and predictive—relegated religion to the realm of the private. ([Location 2526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2526))
- worth preserving? As a distinctive form of politics, nationalism involves demands for congruence between “the nation”—however defined—and the state or polity; in a slightly different idiom, it involves claims that “the nation” should be fully expressed in and protected by an existing or projected state or polity. The fundamental point of reference of nationalist politics is “the nation”; its social ontology posits nations as fundamental social units (Smith 1983: 178). Nations are seen as legitimately entitled to “their own” polities and as “owning” those polities once they are established; authority is seen as legitimate only if it arises from “the nation.” This complex structure of political argument and cultural understanding involves a distinctive social ontology, a particular social imaginary (Anderson 1991; Taylor 2007: chapter 4), and an “ascending” doctrine of political authority and legitimacy (Calhoun 1997). ([Location 2538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2538))
- Moreover, nationalist politics—based on claims made in the name of “the nation”—remain distinct from, even as they are intertwined with, forms of religious politics that seek to transform public life not in the name of the nation, but in the name of God. To be sure, as I discussed earlier, nationalism and religion are often deeply intertwined; political actors may make claims both in the name of the nation and in the name of God. Nationalist politics can accommodate the claims of religion, and nationalist rhetoric often deploys religious language, imagery, and symbolism; similarly, religion can accommodate the claims of the nation-state, and religious movements can deploy nationalist language. ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2555))
- religious movements that pursue a comprehensive transformation of public life do not become nationalist simply by working through the nation-state; nor do they become nationalist by allying with secular nationalists in anticolonial struggles or by deploying the rhetoric of anticolonial nationalism. ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=2561))
- nationalist movements do not turn into specifically religious movements by virtue of deploying religious symbols, emphasizing religious traditions, or even making religious affiliation a criterion of full membership of the nation. Languages of religion and nation, like all forms of language, can be pervasively intertwined. But even when the languages are intertwined, the fundamental ontologies and structures of justification differ. We can be sensitive both to discursive intertwining and to this fundamental difference.

- The cultural or ideological component—analyzed from a different angle in Chapter 6—includes the linked ideas of peoplehood, nationhood, and citizenship. Those over whom a state rules are understood not as subjects but—at least potentially—as active citizens. These citizens are understood to constitute a coherent collectivity, a “people” or nation. This people or nation is understood as relatively homogeneous and as possessing a distinct unity, identity, or character. Finally, state authority is legitimated by some kind of reference to the sovereignty or “ownership” of “the people” or “the nation”: the state is understood as the state of and for a particular “nation.” ([Location 3279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=3279))
- the content of the idea of peoplehood or nationhood—that which gives a people or nation its unity, its character, its particular and distinctive identity—can be specified in various ways. It may be understood as shaped by the state and by shared political experience, or it may be understood as prepolitical, existing prior to and independently of the state. It may be understood as grounded in citizenship, history, language, way of life, descent, race, or religion. ([Location 3286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=3286))
- Smith has consistently distinguished nationalism as a distinctive ideology and movement from national consciousness or national identity (see, for example, 2003: 268). And he continues to argue that while national identities have deep roots in premodern ethnic and (often) religious identities (Smith 1986; Hastings 1997), nationalism crystallizes as a fully elaborated doctrine only in the late eighteenth century (Smith 2008: x). But he now dates the first nationalist movements to these seventeenth-century cases. ([Location 3820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=3820))
- See, for example, Gellner (1983: 142), for whom the key elements of Protestantism “foreshadowed an anonymous, individualistic, fairly unstructured mass society, in which relatively equal access to a shared culture prevails, and the culture has its norms publicly accessible in writing, rather than in the keeping of a privileged specialist. Equal access to a scripturalist God paved the way to equal access to high culture. Literacy is no longer a specialism, but a pre-condition of all the specialisms.… In such a society, one’s prime loyalty is to the medium of our literacy, and to its political protector. The equal access of believers to God eventually becomes equal access of unbelievers to education and culture.” ([Location 3824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TX37GZM&location=3824))
- the territorialization and politicization of religion were nonetheless significant in establishing the principle of the congruence of polity and culture and in providing both a conceptual model of culturally homogeneous political space and an organizational infrastructure for implementing that model in practice. Both conceptual model and organizational infrastructure proved to be transferable to larger scales of political space and to other domains of culture.
