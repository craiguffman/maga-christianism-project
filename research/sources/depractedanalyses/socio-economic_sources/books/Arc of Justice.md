### Highlights

- Every place they passed bore the brand of segregation and the Jim Crow laws. Every station had its “whites” and “coloreds” signs hanging above separate waiting rooms. Every view had its hidden terrors. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=111))

- By the turn of the century, the foreign-born and their children far outnumbered the native-born in almost every large city. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=153))

- Then came the Jazz Age. And suddenly the very changes that made the cities glitter triggered a backlash so bitter that the nation’s great metropolises skidded toward their own version of Jim Crow. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=206))

- Calvin Coolidge, a dour Yankee from the tiny hamlet of Plymouth Notch, Vermont, had been propelled to national prominence in 1919, when as governor of Massachusetts he had broken a strike by the overwhelmingly Irish Catholic Boston police. Four years later, he became president of the United States. But his confrontation with the Boston cops still haunted him. “The unassimilated alien child menaces our children,” he told the readers of Good Housekeeping,“as the alien industrial worker, who has destruction rather than production in mind, menaces our industry.”12 Politicians weren’t alone in sounding the alarm. From his opulent estate just outside Detroit, Henry Ford raged against Jewish bankers and their Bolshevik allies, who were conspiring to destroy all that Anglo-Saxon businessmen had built, his fury tinged with longing for those halcyon days when immigrants and Negroes knew their place.

- And thousands of people poured into the newest and most exciting of the cities’ many fraternal clubs, the Ku Klux Klan, which had been revived by D. W. Griffith’s 1915 film, Birth of a Nation, a paean to the Reconstructionera KKK. The founders of the new Klan were businessmen, pure and simple, who stood for “One Hundred Percent Americanism.” They protected traditional morality: they defended the virtue of white womanhood, assailed bootleggers and their besotted clients, celebrated sobriety and the triumph of a Protestant God. They made sure that all those who threatened the nation—blacks, of course, but also Catholics, Jews, and the foreign-born—were kept in their place. It was a brilliant sales job. In the early 1920s, the Klan broke out of its southern base, racing through the small towns of the Midwest and West. And it absolutely exploded in the big cities. By 1924, Detroit’s Klan had thirty-five thousand members, Chicago’s fifty thousand. The money rolled in, for memberships, robes, rulebooks. And the hatred spewed out from the Klan rallies and marches, protests and political campaigns that spread across urban America.13 ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=230))

- The nativists’ campaign reached high tide in 1924. Anti-immigrant groups had been demanding for years that Congress restrict entry into the United States. The pressure became intense in the early 1920s. Veterans groups lobbied their representatives, the Klan launched a massive letter-writing campaign, businessmen endorsed restriction, and nativist scientists and authors appeared before congressional committees to explain the growing threat to the American racial stock. Congress finally surrendered in the spring of 1924. The National Origins Act imposed such strict limits on the number of immigrants allowed into the country that, for all intents and purposes, it ended the great era of immigration, now eight decades old. Ethnic spokesmen pleaded with the president to veto the bill. But Coolidge remained silent, as was his habit.15 ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=243))

- Bit by bit, however, urban whites carved a color line through the city. When the migration northward began during the war, blacks had been able to find a range of factory jobs. The opportunities shrank in the early 1920s, as many employers decided that all but the most menial and dangerous work should be reserved for whites. More and more white shopkeepers banned black customers from their stores and restaurants. And, most ominously, whites decided that blacks couldn’t live wherever they wanted. They were to be hidden away in a handful of neighborhoods, walled into ghettos. Businessmen infused the real estate market with racist rules and regulations. White landlords wouldn’t show black tenants apartments outside the ghetto. White real estate agents wouldn’t show them houses in white neighborhoods. Bankers wouldn’t offer them mortgages. Insurance agents wouldn’t provide them with coverage. Developers wrote legal restrictions into their deeds, barring blacks from new housing tracts.

- As the structures of segregation hardened, white homeowners became more and more determined to protect their neighborhoods’ racial purity. Those whites who could afford to do so left the ghetto. Those who had no black neighbors organized to keep their areas lily-white. They formed legal organizations—protective association’s, they called them—to write clauses into their deeds prohibiting the sale of their homes to blacks. They monitored real estate sales to make sure no one broke the color line. And if a black family somehow managed to breech the defenses, they could always drive them out, quietly if possible, violently if necessary.

- Racial etiquette heightened the tension. Southern whites expected blacks to be obsequious. Would northern whites expect the same? What would happen if they accidentally brushed against a white woman in the crush to board the subway train? Could they take the empty seat toward the front of the car, as they had been told they could? Or would it be better to sit in the back and avoid even the possibility of a confrontation? There was only a split second to make a decision that, if wrong, might have catastrophic consequences. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=285))

- landlords had carved Harlem’s brownstones and the workmen’s cottages of Black Bottom and the Black Belt into tiny apartments, which they rented at exorbitant rates. The profits rarely found their way back into the buildings. Paint ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=300))

- And he did, though he left Florida with only as much as he could glean from six years in a one-room schoolhouse that shut down when harvest time came. It took him twelve more years to fulfill his parents’ instructions, a dozen long, hard years of schooling to master the material that would make him an educated man and earn the pride that was expected of the race’s best men, all the while working as a serving boy for white people—washing dirty dishes, waiting tables, carting luggage up hotel stairs—just to pay tuition and buy the books his professors required him to read. Ossian never excelled, but he got an education, as fine an education as almost any man in America, colored or white, could claim. By age twenty-five, he had earned his bachelor of science degree from Wilberforce University in Ohio and his medical degree from Washington, D.C.’s Howard University, the jewel in the crown of Negro colleges.

- But Ossian also saw the dangers he would be facing if they moved here. He had already seen what white men could do, and sometimes the memories grabbed hold of him. He could see himself as a small boy again, listening to the terrifying stories of colored men mutilated and murdered at the phosphate pits just outside his hometown. With terrifying clarity he could still see the mob of whites, hundreds and hundreds of them, gathered around that black boy, Fred Rochelle, the one who lived a few blocks from the Sweet family, who had been accused of raping a white girl. He could pick out individuals amid the throng, ordinary people from the white side of town—the jeweler, the livery owner, the butcher—their faces alight with anticipation as they waited for the moment when the torch met the pyre and the flames began to lick at Rochelle’s battered body. Then the memories flashed to another time, another place, so far from Florida and yet so similar. Ossian could see the gangs of white soldiers and sailors roaming the streets of Washington, D.C., the summer after the war, looking for Negroes to maim and kill, marching up Seventh Street toward Howard University, toward the medical school, toward Ossian himself. He could see them coming for him. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=496))

- But there was no doubt that the police department was thick with Klansmen. The KKK had started recruiting in Detroit in 1921, and since then, their poison had seeped into almost every corner of the city. In private, Klan leaders claimed that there were more members in Detroit than any other place in the country. When ill health forced Detroit’s mayor to resign in 1924, the KKK ran one of its own in the special election called to fill his seat. Only a rigged ballot count kept the Klansman from victory. The regular election was set for November 1925, and the Klan was determined not to be defeated again. All summer long, the Invisible Order organized, building its campaign, spreading its message. And one spectacular night in July 1925, it displayed its power. That evening, ten thousand white-robed knights gathered in a field on Detroit’s west side, their rally brilliantly illuminated by the blinding light of a burning cross.

- But Ossian didn’t have a coherent story to tell. He had the shards of his family’s history: the legacy of a half-remembered moment when the world was full of promise; the dreams his mother had sustained during the bitter descent into segregation; the weight of his name, the meaning of which he barely knew. And he had his own memories, trailing backward from Garland Avenue to the Jim Crow South, backward to the dusty streets of his boyhood home, to the tidy kitchen of the house his father built, to the tiny school where the black children learned their lessons, to the riot of trees and tropical plants tumbling down the banks of the Peace River, to the smell of burning flesh wafting across the placid water, filling his imagination with the most grotesque of horrors.

- Worse, the planters used their power to subvert the freedmen’s efforts. Leon County landowners blocked government attempts to settle freedmen on federal land. And they refused to sell even small portions of their plantations to Negroes. Many planters ruthlessly exploited the colored families who rented small plots from them. A few used the slightest pretenses to expel their tenants from the land once the crop was close to harvest. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1109))

- The threat of violence was constant. Across the cotton belt, planters organized terrorist cells: the Regulators, the Whitecappers, the Ku Klux Klan. Operating under the protection of darkness, the Klan and their fellows targeted anyone who dared to challenge white domination. They forced teachers in colored schools to abandon their posts. They threatened, assaulted, and burned out those few freedmen who managed to acquire land of their own. Mostly, they waged war against the Republican state governments that set Reconstruction’s rules. Vigilantes assassinated dozens of Republicans in the late 1860s and early 1870s, as many as seventy in the heavily black county just east of Leon, where the Klan ran rampant. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1112))
- When both the Republicans and Democrats claimed victory in the presidential election, the nation was thrown into a constitutional crisis. Only a Faustian bargain broke the deadlock. The Republican candidate, the ineffectual Rutherford B. Hayes, took the White House. Democrats took control of Florida’s state government. Hayes promised them that there would be no more federal interference in their affairs. The Democrats, champions of white supremacy, could do as they wanted. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1151))
- The Democrats also had to overcome the limits of their imagination. They knew how to be cruel. But they had to create a social system premised on cruelty. That was a task that took some creativity. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1166))
- Some steps were obvious. Black voters had made radical Republicanism possible. So they had to be stripped of the right to vote. As a start, the Democrats imposed a poll tax in 1887; voter registration plummeted by 50 percent the first year the tax was imposed. The Democrats followed that triumph by gradually tightening registration further. By 1895, when the last laws were put into place, it was almost impossible for a Negro to vote in the state of Florida. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1167))
- The next steps were more complicated. The vast majority of whites assumed blacks to be inferior. The trick was to make them act on those beliefs. Democrats began by defending the purity of the white race, not a straightforward matter in a society where interracial sex had a long history. But legislators, insisting that racial lines could be strictly drawn, imposed a stringent definition of who qualified as colored: a person was legally a Negro if just one of his great-grandparents had been black. Legislators also prohibited any further dilution of the white race. Blacks and whites couldn’t have sexual relationships, couldn’t marry, couldn’t even spend a night in the same bedroom. With the groundwork laid, the Democrats gradually moved into the public sphere. Florida’s whites had already barred blacks from some public places, such as theaters and hotels. But the segregation didn’t have the force of law; it was custom, nothing more. The Democrats mandated the separation and extended it to the places where the New South was being created. Florida was one of the first southern states to require blacks to ride in separate railroad cars. And the legislature made it a crime to teach black and white children in the same classroom. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1171))
- whites became more and more determined to assert the power of their race. So they piled prohibition on prohibition. Blacks couldn’t be buried in the same cemeteries as whites. They couldn’t eat in the same restaurants. They couldn’t ride in the front of city streetcars. They couldn’t drink from the same drinking fountains. Whites also segregated their workplaces. Blacks could be servants and farm laborers, of course, and they could work in the turpentine and lumber camps, where most whites didn’t want to go. But whites claimed the vast majority of jobs for themselves. They also demanded privileges that superiority conferred. They expected blacks to step off the sidewalk when a white person approached. They insisted that blacks keep their eyes downcast when they spoke to whites. They demanded that blacks call them “sir” or “ma’am,” though they would never dream of reciprocating. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1181))
- Jim Crow taught the great mass of southern whites to see ordinary places and everyday interactions as sacred and to protect the sacred by embracing the profane. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1188))
- But it just wouldn’t do to have blacks mingling with whites, especially given Bartow’s new importance. So, as the town fathers put in the sewer lines, the streetlights, and the telephone exchange, they split the town in half. The few blacks who had been able to vote in the 1870s and 1880s were barred by the poll tax; only whites voted by the 1890s, and they always elected Democrats. Blacks weren’t welcome in the Orange Hotel, the opera house, or the Main Street stores. They couldn’t attend the outdoor entertainments—the county fair in March, the occasional traveling shows—except on specially designated “colored days.” They couldn’t pray in the fine white churches. They couldn’t bury their dead in the white cemetery. But all those prohibitions weren’t sufficient. Just about the time the Sweets’ wagon rumbled into town, Bartow officials pushed segregation to its logical conclusion. Blacks couldn’t even live among whites. Those who owned land in the center of the town—including some of Bartow’s founders— would have to sell their homes and move to the other side of the railroad tracks, to the subdivision Florida Southern had laid out ten years earlier, to the other Bartow. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1273))
- Owning land was a wonderful thing, the great triumph of Henry’s generation. But as the AME had taught them, land wasn’t enough. The children had to have an education, they said, to take their schooling as far as it would go. For when they reached adulthood, they were duty bound—by their church, by the struggles of the generations that went before them—to be models of Christian virtue and race pride. And only education could give them the tools they needed.56 ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1319))
- Violence wasn’t just a political tool, though. It was a way of life under Jim Crow. Whites learned to have hair-trigger tempers. If a black person caused the slightest offense—anything at all would do—whites felt free to lash out. It was a right slaveholders once had claimed. Now any white person enjoyed the same privilege.61 ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1353))
- When Ossian was a boy, the violence escalated to pathological proportions. There were reasons for the upsurge. Decades of sweeping economic change had stripped many southern whites of the security and independence they’d once enjoyed. In the 1890s, a stunning new political insurgency—the Populist movement—sought to rally embattled whites in an assault on the economic order the Democrats had built, even if that meant, as it did in some states, seeking out the support of colored men as well. Desperate to beat back the Populist threat, Democrats tried to redirect whites’ anger away from their party and toward their erstwhile colored allies. It was a shockingly bitter campaign, playing on whites’ deepest fears of moral decay, economic impotence, and sexual inadequacy. Blacks were poised to attack, speakers proclaimed, to steal honest white men’s hard-won gains, to strip them of political power, to rape their women. ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1356))
- As Populism crumbled, darkness descended on the South. Whites waited in fear and anticipation for outrages to begin. Even the rumor of an incident could drive whites into a frenzy of violence, an orgy of retaliation. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1367))
- Jim Crow didn’t discriminate between “good” Negroes and “bad” Negroes; every black person was suspect, every community open to assault. No one was safe. ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1396))
- It was never easy to leave, to slip free of piles of debts, to shutter homes and abandon lands, to say good-bye to family and friends. But a hundred thousand colored people did just that between 1900 and 1915, many of them, like Ossian, very young and very scared. ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1474))
- But it was absolutely appalling to see southern-style racism slither into everyday life above the Mason-Dixon Line. This hatred was spread in part through the power of ideas. While scientists and philosophers published learned studies measuring the chasm between Anglo-Saxons and Africans, an increasing number of ordinary northerners endorsed the racial slanders southern demagogues had perfected. Where whites had once talked bravely of racial justice, they now whispered of Negro workers stealing white men’s jobs and colored rapists ravaging white women. And they cheered the demagogues themselves, who traveled the North lecturing on the True Souths struggles to contain the black beast. ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1615))
- Demographics turned harsh words into brutal actions. It had been easy enough for northerners to declare fealty to racial equality when more than 90 percent of the nation’s colored population lived in the South. As the black migration accelerated, though, northern interest in segregation grew stronger. Many of those white workers lucky enough to belong to unions refused to extend solidarity to Negro workingmen, while a growing number of employers refused to hire colored people for anything but the most menial of jobs, unless they needed to break a strike, at which point Negro labor would do just fine. White homeowners were beginning to object to having colored families live nearby. And more and more white customers were demanding that blacks be excluded from restaurants, hotels, theaters, and other public venues. Neighborhoods and businesses weren’t the only places where Negroes were increasingly unwelcome: at Scarborough’s beloved Oberlin, there was talk of black and white students taking their Bible studies in separate classes. None of this segregation had the sanction of law—state civil rights statutes remained on the books—and it wasn’t consistently applied: it was a patchwork of practices, differing from place to place and even street to street. But for colored people, the trend was frighteningly familiar. ([Location 1620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1620))
- The paroxysm of violence that convulsed Springfield, Illinois, on August 14, 1908, was induced by the familiar toxic blend of economic conflict and racial hatred. That most explosive of events, a rumor of rape, led the white citizens of Illinois’ capital on a rampage against their black neighbors. National Guardsmen restored order the following dawn, but by then six Negroes had been shot dead, two more had been lynched, and two thousand driven from town. Northerners had come to expect such atrocities in the South. But there was something truly shocking about the violence in Illinois. Springfield wasn’t just another place on the map, after all. It was the home and final resting place of Abraham Lincoln. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1657))
- Washington’s drive for unity halted at the color line. Southern-born Wilson had already done a great deal to advance segregation during his first four years in office, having extended Jim Crow into Washington’s offices, cafeterias, and lavatories and purging thousands of Negro civil servants from government payrolls. Now he dashed the Talented Tenth’s hopes that they might win civil rights by serving their country. There was never any question that the army would be segregated, but no one was prepared for the flagrant insults the military leveled. The young men training in Des Moines were told that when they went to war they would all serve in a single division commanded by whites; not one of them would be commissioned at field rank. The very best black officers were simply shunted aside. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1807))
- The American military draft, meanwhile, drained factories of workers at precisely the time industrialists were desperately trying to fill the flood of military orders. Facing a labor shortage of unprecedented proportions, employers sent word south that long-standing racial barriers were being torn down for the duration. The news had an electric effect on sharecroppers, day laborers, and domestics desperate to escape grinding poverty and decades of unrelenting brutality. Almost half a million southern blacks left the South for industrial centers like Detroit, Chicago, and New York in 1917 alone, an exodus so great that southern whites feared the economy of their region might well collapse from want of workers. ([Location 1818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1818))
- On July 1, 1917, it toppled over the precipice. For days, rumors of an impending white attack had swirled through the black neighborhood. Late on the first, jittery blacks mistakenly opened fire on a police car, killing two plainclothesmen. In retaliation, white mobs rampaged through the black part of town in an explosion of violence that made the Springfield riots seem like minor affairs. Whites killed at least forty Negroes and perhaps many more; some victims were hurriedly buried in unmarked graves, while others were dumped into the creeks that fed the Mississippi. Hundreds were injured, thousands made homeless as the mob burned block after block to the ground. The Talented Tenth pleaded with the president to condemn the outrage, but Wilson refused to say a word. So the NAACP responded with a stony silence of its own. In New York City’s burgeoning black enclave of Harlem, the association’s recently hired field secretary, poet, composer, journalist, lawyer, politician, and diplomat James Weldon Johnson, organized a massive protest parade, ten thousand Negroes—women and children in white, men in black—marching down Fifth Avenue without a sound except for the tramp of boots and the tattoo of muffled drums. At the head of the column waved the Stars and Stripes and a banner reading “Blood Is On Your Hands.”44 ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1830))
- Ossian had no doubt that he was going to be a more talented doctor than most graduates of white medical schools. But almost no white hospital in the country would welcome him as an intern. The AMA wouldn’t permit him to be a member. Virtually no white patients would have him as their physician. So for all his training, all his hours of study, all his skills, chances were good that he would have to build a practice among people too poor to pay his fees, that he’d have to serve as an attending physician in an ill-equipped and underfunded black hospital, and when one of his patients needed the sort of care that only a superior facility could provide, Ossian would have to turn over the case to a white doctor who was his inferior in everything but the color of his skin.54 ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1922))
- Ossian wasn’t shaken solely by his confrontation with the medical profession’s discriminatory practices, as galling as they were. Halfway through his time at Howard, he also had to face the terror buried deeply inside him. In the summer of 1919, the racial tensions that the Great War had triggered exploded in an unprecedented surge of violence. This time, the bloodshed didn’t occur in some distant place like Springfield or East St. Louis. It swept through the streets of Washington itself, from Pennsylvania Avenue all the way to Howard’s gates. As it did, all the newfound confidence faded away in a blinding fog of fear.

- The South had its share of outrages. A score of Negroes were lynched in the first half of 1919, including one veteran hung for wearing his uniform in public. There were two major antiblack pogroms, one in Charleston, South Carolina, in May, another in Longview, Texas, in June.

- Foggy Bottom was quickly overrun and the southwest neighborhood again imperiled. But in northwest Washington the mob met massive resistance. All day long, the area’s Negroes had been preparing to defend themselves. Residents bought up any gun that was for sale, and when the stock ran out, they grabbed free weapons that had been rushed in from Baltimore. Many families barricaded themselves inside their homes to await the mob’s attack, while groups of men organized themselves into neighborhood defense units. Whites arrived as darkness descended. Down the side streets, gunfire blazed from upstairs windows; passing automobiles were riddled with bullets and members of the white mob scattered for cover. Main thoroughfares became battlegrounds. The intersection of Seventh Avenue and T Street, a few blocks south of Howard, saw the most fearsome fighting. Blacks and whites engaged in hand-to-hand combat throughout the night. Dozens were seriously injured, including two policemen, and one black man was shot to death. Only exhaustion and the approaching dawn ended the bloodshed.60 ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=1973))

- As it happened, the summer’s savagery was just beginning. Less than a week after peace was restored in the nation’s capital, whites on Chicago’s South Side stoned to death a black boy who mistakenly had gone swimming at a beach whites considered their own. Rumors of imminent black retaliation sparked yet another assault, this one much worse than either East St. Louis or Washington. In the course of five days, twenty-three Negroes and fifteen whites were murdered, five hundred were injured, and millions of dollars in property was destroyed. Fears of sexual violence, that most potent of provocations, triggered smaller riots in Knoxville, Tennessee, in August, and Omaha, Nebraska, in September And in October 1919, whites in eastern Arkansas slaughtered a hundred or more black sharecroppers they feared were going to form a union. With such a staggering series of offenses to occupy the public mind, most Americans soon forgot about the Washington riot. But for Ossian, the violence on the streets of the capital had reopened the wound cut in Bartow years before. The wound was sure to close; he was young and resilient. Yet there was always the chance of another rupture, should the terror come again.64 ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2000))

- In the course of 1920, the Ku Klux Klan, reborn in Georgia five years earlier, began its race into the North by adding anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and xenophobia to its traditional appeal to white supremacy In the wells of Congress, meanwhile, the nation’s representatives pushed relentlessly toward closing the country to further immigration, a fundamental reversal of the policy that had made the nation’s industrialization possible.

- Farther north, segregation wasn’t yet so advanced. But the situation continued to be dangerously unstable. On Chicago’s bloody racial frontier, whites bombed eight separate properties bought by Negroes in the first three months of 1920. Ongoing guerilla warfare wasn’t enough, though, to stem the flow of migrants out of the south; it was better to risk a sudden outburst on the streets of a major city than to face perpetual poverty and oppression in the cotton fields of Alabama or Mississippi.66 ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2026))

- Such dramatic economic expansion fueled massive migration: more than a million people now lived in Detroit, twice as many as in 1910. No matter how furiously officials tried to annex more land, they couldn’t make room for all the people. In the city center, where empty lots had once sat waiting for development, neighborhoods had become so crowded they were beginning to resemble Manhattan’s Lower East Side or Chicago’s infamous Back of the Yards. “A city which is built around a productive process ... is really a kind of hell,” wrote a young Detroit minister, Reinhold Niebuhr. “Thousands in this town are really living in torment while the rest of us eat, drink, and make merry. What a civilization!“ ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2092))

Detroit’s cops, themselves overwhelmingly nativeborn whites, were almost as likely to rough up foreign-born and colored suspects as they were to arrest them. In the poorer districts, more than a few innocent citizens felt the whack of a billy club in the course of a year. Down on the factory floor, meanwhile, Ford and his fellow manufacturers turned a blind eye to the dictatorial regimes of their foremen, who forced out ever-increasing production by threatening their men hour after hour, day after day.

- Most migrants didn’t find those fabulous tradesmen’s wages. By southern standards, though, typical Detroit pay rates were nothing short of spectacular: assembly-line workers earned up to six dollars a day during the war years, some of the highest industrial wages anywhere in America. No wonder Detroit’s black population shot up at such an extraordinary rate: between 1910 and 1920, Detroit’s black population had increased by 600 percent. No other colored community above the Mason-Dixon Line, not even Harlem, had grown so fast.12 ([Location 2163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2163))

- it was mounting discrimination in the real estate market that increasingly sealed Negroes into Black Bottom. Since the early 1910s, white real estate agents and landlords in Chicago and New York had refused to so much as show Negroes homes in white neighborhoods, saying that the presence of colored people depressed property values. In the course of the Great War, those practices spread to Detroit. Not every real estate agent or landlord signed on: if colored folks were willing to pay a premium for a piece of property in a white part of town, some real estate men were happy to oblige them. But to defy the new racial conventions took more courage—or more avarice—than many real estate agents and landlords had. So discriminatory practices passed from office to office, property to property, and racial hatred gradually turned into common business practice, the way things were done.16 ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2203))

- Of all the problems that afflicted the neighborhood, none was greater than disease. Contagion was a constant threat, partly because everyone lived in close quarters, partly because no one was vaccinated: a migrant carried smallpox up from the South a few years before Ossian arrived and in short order Black Bottom faced an epidemic. Syphilis, the plague of the vice district, also was widespread. But dramatic illnesses weren’t the real threat. Straightforward diseases—those that afflicted the poor, that flourished in dirt and fetid air—those were the ones that devastated Black Bottom. Pneumonia was twice as likely to kill a Negro as it was a white person, tuberculosis three times as likely. Parents buried children lost to afflictions as simple as diarrhea and enteritis, malnutrition and exposure. In 1919, 595 colored babies were born in the city; 89 of them were dead by 1920.26 ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2280))

- He brooded over Tulsa’s epic 1921 pogrom, still a raw wound the following year. More than a hundred colored people had died in two days of white rioting, all of it brought on by a Negro teenager accidentally brushing up against a white girl in a downtown elevator. But Ossian fixed on a single death, which Walter White had movingly chronicled for the Nation. Dr. A. C. Jackson was one of Tulsa’s most promising young men, a skilled surgeon who, White carefully noted, had done advanced study at the Mayo Clinic. On the first day of the riot, Jackson exhausted himself treating the wounded, and when darkness finally came, he hid in the basement of his substantial home, which by some miracle the rioters had yet to set ablaze. Early in the morning of the second day, Jackson smelled whiffs of smoke from the fires that were beginning to consume his block. Facing immolation, he came out of his hiding place to surrender to the vigilantes filling his street. “Here I am,” the doctor yelled out, his arms upraised. “Take me.” But one of the mob, a teenager out for a night of fun, lowered his rifle and pumped two bullets into Jackson’s chest. Then another white boy stepped over the doctor as he writhed in pain on the sidewalk and shot him again.50 ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2500))

- year and a half later, Ossian’s attention was riveted by another southern riot. On New Year’s Day 1923, news of a rape shot through the hamlet of Sumner, Florida. Enraged whites marched on the nearby colored town of Rosewood, though they had no proof that the rapist was hiding there. Like the black men of Washington, D.C., in 1919, Rosewood’s Negroes tried to defend themselves from the assault, but they were overrun. At least seventeen of Rosewood’s residents were murdered that day, and the rest were driven into the countryside while the mob burned the town to the ground. The story cut into Ossian partly because the attack took place just seventy miles north of Bartow.51 But there was more to it than that. In Tulsa and Rosewood, Ossian could see the reflection of the fires that had burned above the banks of the Peace River and along the streets of Washington, D.C., and in those flickering flames— ([Location 2509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2509))

Klan newsboys took to selling the organization’s newspaper, the Fiery Cross, on street corners.

But that wasn’t common practice in Detroit until the early 1920s, when suddenly developers blanketed the new houses on the city’s outskirts with restrictive covenants, a practice they turned into a selling point. “We have carefully restricted this section to include only the kind of people you would be glad to have next door,” one of the biggest firms proudly proclaimed as it unveiled its newest development on the far west side. “Here you can feel free to make friends with your neighbors.” ([Location 2922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2922))

- Ever since the Great War, many white real estate agents had refused to show colored families properties outside Black Bottom. But it wasn’t until 1924 that the real estate agents’ trade association absolutely barred its members from selling houses in white neighborhoods to Negro customers and imposed sanctions on those who dared to break the rules. At almost exactly the same time, housing appraisers made it official practice to downgrade the value of any neighborhood that had even a single black resident, a requirement that immediately transformed even the most well-to-do colored homebuyers into credit risks, since the moment a purchase was complete the property wasn’t worth as much as it had been. And because blacks drove down property values, there wasn’t a bank in Detroit willing to give Negroes a mortgage.

But Ossian and Gladys had nowhere else to go, so the Smiths upped their asking price to $18,500. To make sure the Sweets couldn’t walk away, they offered to finance the purchase themselves. Ossian and Gladys would put down 20 percent of the asking price and pay the balance directly to the Smiths in 120 monthly installments of $150 each. Of course, there were a few catches. The Smiths would keep the title to the house until the final payment was made, so Ossian and Gladys wouldn’t actually own the bungalow until 1935. In the intervening ten years, they would pay the Smiths an extraordinary 18 percent interest on the balance ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=2959))

- The major downtown banks, rock-ribbed conservatives that they were, wouldn’t allow their customers to borrow more than 50 percent of a house’s value, and they required that loans be repaid in the briefest of periods, often within three to five years. With housing prices so high, most families couldn’t possibly put down 50 percent of a purchase, so they had to take out second and even third mortgages just to piece together a down payment. Because banks refused to make such deals, borrowers were forced to turn to mortgage companies and local moneylenders, who gouged their desperate customers with usurious interest rates. Even if homeowners did manage to make their multiple payments, loan periods were so short that they were constantly refinancing. By the summer of 1925, ten years after they bought the tiny house next to the bungalow, the Getkes had already taken out three mortgages and were in negotiations for a fourth, a thousand dollars larger than the original.

Once they were in custody, Negroes routinely were held for days without being formally charged and often were denied access to lawyers— sometimes suspects were moved from precinct to precinct so they couldn’t be found, then were threatened and even beaten until they confessed.

- “This is the question of the psychology of the race,” he argued, “of how everything known to a race affects its actions. What we learn as children we remember—it gets fastened to the mind. . . . Because this defendant’s actions were predicated on the psychology of the past I ask that this testimony be admitted.” ([Location 5874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=5874))

- He talked of prejudices “that have been taught to us and that began coming to us almost with our mother’s milk, and they stick almost as the color of the skin sticks.” He talked of the evils that prejudice produces, the way “it will take good, kindly, human men and women and make them fiends [who] throw reason to the wind and throw justice to the wind and throw mercy to the wind.” And he admitted, the way only a man of Darrow’s confidence could admit, that the jurors surely were prejudiced themselves, as was he, though he liked to think otherwise.

- Think, most of all, he continued, of brilliant Dr. Sweet, seeing in the mob the history of his race, “loaded like sardines in a box in the mid-decks of steamers and brought forcibly from their African homes, half of them dying in the voyage. He knew they were sold like chattels as slaves and were compelled to work without pay; he knew that families were separated when it paid the master to sell them; he knew that even after he had got liberty under the Constitution and the law he knew that ... in every state of the Union telegraph poles had been decorated by the bodies of Negroes dangling to ropes on account of race hatred and nothing else.” He had the jurors with him now, moving through Sweet’s terrors, back to Bartow, up to Garland, into the face of hatred. “He knew they had been tied to stakes in free America and a fire built around living human beings until they roasted to death; he knew they had been driven from their homes in the north and in great cities and here in Detroit, and he was there not only to defend himself and his house and his friends but to stand for the integrity and the independence of the abused race to which he belonged ... a hero who fought a brave fight against fearful odds, a fight for the right, for justice, for freedom, and his name will live and be honored when most of us are forgotten.” Judging by men and women such as these, Darrow archly asked, wouldn’t any reasonable person conclude that it was not the Nordic but the Negro who belonged to the superior race?

Who are we, any of us, to be boastful above our fellows?” ([Location 5995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=5995))

- He wouldn’t demand that the walls of segregation be brought down, that whites welcome blacks into their neighborhoods, or that they acknowledge Negroes as the brothers they were. Like Johnny Smith before him, he asked for nothing more than tolerance. “I ask you gentlemen in behalf of my clients,” he boomed. “I ask you more than everything else, I ask you in behalf of justice, often maligned and down-trodden, hard to protect and hard to maintain, I ask you in behalf of yourselves, in behalf of our race, to see that no harm comes to them. I ask you gentlemen in the name of the future, the future which will one day solve these sore problems, and the future which is theirs as well as ours, I ask you in the name of the future to do justice in this case.”72 ([Location 6010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6010))

- The recently fearsome Ku Klux Klan, meanwhile, plunged into freefall. After its humiliation in the mayoral campaign, the KKK’s national office—itself scarred by a sex scandal so vicious polite society couldn’t discuss the details—ousted Detroit’s kleagle, Ira Stout, amid accusations of incompetence and embezzlement. Rather than go quietly, Stout fought back. Account books disappeared; warrants were issued; ever more venomous charges and countercharges were exchanged, each bitter turn splashed across the front pages of the city’s newspapers until even the most devoted Klansmen must have wondered what had become of the brave-hearted men who had promised to purify America.

- There it was: a darkness so deep it made men blind. “Prejudices have burned men at the stake,” Darrow told the jurors, “broken them on the rack, torn every joint apart, destroyed people by the million. Men have done this on account of some terrible prejudice which even now is reaching out to undermine this republic of ours and to destroy the freedom that has been the most cherished part of our institutions. These witnesses honestly believe that it is their duty to keep colored people out. They honestly believe that the blacks are an inferior race and yet if they look at themselves, I don’t know how they can. If they had one colored family up there, some of the neighbors might learn how to pronounce ‘Goethe.’ It would be too bad to spread a little culture in that vicinity. They might die. They are possessed with that idea and that fanaticism, and when people are possessed with that they are terribly cruel. They don’t stand alone. Others have done the same thing. Others will do the same thing as long as this weary world shall last. They may do it again, but, gentlemen, they ought not to ask you to do it for them. That is a pretty dirty job to turn over to a jury, and they ought not to expect you to do it.” ([Location 6783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6783))
- “These people are the children of slavery. If the race that we belong to owes anything to any human being, or to any power in this Universe, they owe it to these black men. Above all other men, they owe an obligation and a duty to these black men which can never be repaid. I never see one of them that I do not feel I ought to pay part of the debt of my race—and if you gentlemen feel as you should feel in this case, your emotions will be like mine.” ([Location 6798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6798))
- do not believe in the law of hate,” he said. “I may not be true to my ideals always, but I believe in the law of love, and I believe you can do nothing with hatred. I would like to see a time when man loves his fellow man, and forgets his color or his creed. We will never be civilized until that time comes. I know the Negro race has a long road to go. I believe the life of a Negro has been a life full of tragedy, of injustice, of oppression. The law has made him equal—but man has not. ... I know there is a long road ahead of him, before he can take the place which I believe he should take. I know that before him there is suffering, tribulation, and death among the blacks, and perhaps among the whites. I am sorry. I would do what I can to avert it. I would advise patience; I would advise toleration; I would advise understanding; I would advise all those things which are necessary for men who live together. . . . This is all. I ask you, gentlemen, on behalf of this defendant, on behalf of these helpless ones who turn to you, and more than that—on behalf of this great state, and this great city which must face this problem, and face it fairly—I ask you in the name of progress and the human race, to return a verdict of not guilty in this case!“ ([Location 6802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6802))
- But Darrow had sensed something in the Sweet trial— something in the way his words were heard, perhaps, or in the mix of people he came to know during those days or in the passionate politics that swirled around the case—that gave him hope. And he was right. In the first quarter of the twentieth century, there was no dishonor in believing that white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants stood atop an inviolate hierarchy of the races, no shame in saying that blacks, Jews, Catholics, and the immigrant masses—Italians, Irishmen, Greeks, Slavs, Poles, Turks, Russians, Mexicans, Chinese, and so many others—were by their very nature inferior beings. But, over the course of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, the voices of toleration slowly pushed those ideas toward the dark corners of metropolitan America.

- Not that racial and ethnic hatred disappeared. But they became disreputable, a sign of crudeness, stupidity, and moral failing, a product of the prejudice that, as Darrow had said, made men terribly cruel. As attitudes changed, the virulent racism that had swept across the urban North in the 1910s and 1920s faded away. The intelligentsia exchanged its grand theories of racial evolution for a subtle understanding of the brotherhood of man. The Ku Klux Klan shriveled to nothingness, until even the memory of its meteoric rise was lost. Shops and theaters and even some workplaces gradually abandoned the color lines they had hastily erected when the Great Migration began.

- The easing of the extraordinary tensions of the 1910s and 1920s, in turn, convinced more and more northern whites that they were in fact a tolerant people, a perception reinforced by the persistence of the most blatant forms of discrimination below the Mason-Dixon Line. That’s where the nation’s racial problems lay, northerners concluded: in the daily humiliations of segregation, the obvious wrong of disenfranchisement, and the habitual injustice of southern courtrooms, not in the streets of New York, Chicago, and Detroit, where a black woman riding in the front of a bus was no cause for concern.2 ([Location 6884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6884))

- Thus began Murphy’s extraordinary climb to national prominence. During the 1930s, he served as governor-general of the Philippines, governor of Michigan, and attorney general of the United States, always with the studied sympathy for the underdog he’d proclaimed when crisscrossing Detroit’s east side in search of votes in 1923. His last promotion came in 1940, and it was the greatest of them all, to a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Being on the court, he said, gave him “the rarest of all opportunities to evangelize for tolerance and all things that are just.” During his nine-year tenure, he did just that, defending the right of Jehovah’s Witnesses not to salute the American flag, of Communist Party members to speak their minds without fear of reprisal, of protesters to picket peacefully, of accused criminals to receive fair trials. He abhorred “the ugly abyss of racism,” he wrote in his searing dissent condemning the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. And when NAACP lawyers came before the court, as they did in several critically important cases during his tenure, Murphy always gave them his vote.

- the Supreme Court ruled against the NAACP in the Washington, D.C., restrictive covenant case, as Moorfield Storey feared it would. With that defeat, the association lost its last hope of stopping the color line from being drawn across urban America. Over the next few decades, racism and the forces of the marketplace, which had only begun to intertwine in the 1920s, thoroughly fused together. Developers placed restrictive covenants on their deeds as a matter of course; real estate agents invariably steered colored customers away from white neighborhoods; banks and insurance companies made it ironclad policy to refuse services to blacks buying homes in white areas; and in a cruel turn of politics, the New Dealers who depended on the black vote gave these discriminatory practices government sanction by writing them into the many housing programs they created in the 1930s, so that in every one of the nation’s great cities the once disconnected walls of segregation were made complete. ([Location 6971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6971))
- Eventually, black activists forced whites to recognize the role that the marketplace played in maintaining the color line. The NAACP finally won a reversal of the Washington decision in 1948, the victory secured in a case brought to the association by a black man who had been barred from buying a home just six blocks from the house Alexander Turner had tried to make his in the summer of 1925. It took another twenty years—until the cataclysmic summer of 1968—to push through federal legislation prohibiting discrimination in the selling and financing of homes. By then, it was too late. Segregation had become so deeply entrenched in urban America it couldn’t be uprooted, no matter what the law said. To this day, the nation’s cities remain deeply divided, black and white neighborhoods separated by enduring discriminatory practices, racial fears and hatreds, and the casual acceptance by too many people that there is no problem to address. And of all the cities in the United States, none is more segregated than Detroit. ([Location 6987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J48BMI&location=6987))
