### Highlights

- Individualism, moreover, helped the wealthy resolutely deny the existence of social classes, despite all the signs of friction around them. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=208))
- By the end of the nineteenth century, the middle class was giving distinctive new answers to the questions that confronted all social groups about the relationship between the individual and society, the nature of men, women, and the home, and the place of work and pleasure in daily ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=837))

- Victorianism gave way to progressivism. This ideological transformation not only drove middle-class people to change themselves and to make new homes; it also demanded that they change the world around them. Progressivism unleashed a powerful reforming dynamic across America, just at the time when farmers, workers, and the upper class were all too weak or divided to command the nation. Seizing the opportunity, the progressive middle class offered a radicalism at the center of American society, an ambitious program to halt the friction and conflicts of the industrializing nation.

- U.S. participation in the Great War gave progressives their “heart’s desire” …the best opportunity they ever had to remake the nation along progressive lines. ([Location 5084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5084))

- The federal government intervened in American life more boldly than ever before with sweeping measures to control all aspects of the economy, halt class conflict, and reshape personal identity. ([Location 5087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5087))

- Bringing peace to Europe, the progressives created only chaos and conflict at home. Rather than an advertisement for a progressive future, the Wilsonian war effort became the death knell for the progressive movement.3 ([Location 5090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5090))

- Rooted in domestic concerns, in thinking about human nature, gender, class, and pleasure, progressive ideology produced no particular vision of the nation’s international interests. ([Location 5093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5093))

- Jane Addams, too, was deeply disturbed by the younger generation’s “astounding emphasis upon sex” and “their sense of release and their new confidence in self-expression.” Youth, she charged, had “gone back to liberty for the individual.” As a result, they lacked “reforming energy.” ([Location 5686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5686))
- Today, it is hard to believe that a majority of progressives actively opposed FDR—but they did. Their critique gives us a glimpse as to why liberal politics—indeed, all politics—has been disappointing ever since the Progressive Era.

- Brilliant politician that he was, FDR learned from the debacles of the Wilsonian war government and the 1920 presidential election. In particular, he recognized that the progressives paid a heavy price for their bold attempts to reshape personal identity. As President, Roosevelt largely avoided the rhetoric of personal transformation. He sensed that most Americans wanted the federal government to limit the individualism of the big businessmen whom his cousin Theodore had once called “malefactors of great wealth” and whom he branded “economic royalists.” And FDR knew, better than the old progressives, how much the people were eager for Washington to help ensure their prosperity. But, like the Republicans of the 1920s, he realized that most Americans wanted to be left free to pursue pleasure, to indulge in the individual gratification of consumerism. The task of government was to make sure Americans could afford pleasure, and then get out of the way. ([Location 5707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5707))
- prohibition, the ultimate symbol of the progressives’ attempts to constrain individualism and pleasure. ([Location 5715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5715))
- The reformers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were prepared to use a host of coercive and manipulative practices in order to transform diverse Americans into middle-class people. ([Location 5720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5720))
- The race riots and antiwar demonstrations, the failure of the “war on poverty,” and the high inflation and deindustrialization of the 1960s and 1970s all reinforced the basic lesson of the Progressive Era that reformers should not try too much. ([Location 5736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5736))
- But the Reaganites never undertook an elaborate campaign to re-create Americans’ identity along conservative lines. The Reagan era was a revolution only in name.10 ([Location 5743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003L77UF2&location=5743))
