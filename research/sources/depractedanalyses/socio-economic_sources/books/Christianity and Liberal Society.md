### Highlights

- His best-known book in his native country, Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism (1965), is an extended meditation on the loss of Canadian national identity and its absorption into the capitalist, progressive, spearhead of modernity that is the United States. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=92))
- Chapter 3 I consider Niebuhr's criticisms of liberalism's progressivism and optimistic conceptions of human nature and reason, together with the self-redemptive approaches to salvation which such accounts suggest. Although the facileness and sentimentality that Niebuhr diagnosed in early twentieth-century liberalism do not so readily characterize contemporary liberals, it is arguable that parallel considerations to his could be applied to the late twentieth-century obsession with, and dependence on, economic and technological growth. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=121))
- Until relatively recently, Maritain tended to be treated in the literature as the subject of either hagiography or demonography, his social and political thought being supposed to require either mere exposition, that its light might shine forth with indisputable brilliance, or mere mention, that it might be dismissed with equally indisputable scorn. Neither approach demonstrates the critical sympathy he richly deserves. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=129))
- some theological reflections on the issues raised by the trend towards qualifying the power of elected governments in favour of the judiciary through the constitutional incorporation of Bills of Rights and the right of judicial review. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=136))
- an apparent conflict between the values of liberalism and democracy, ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=140))
- a reinterpretation of liberalism in response to the conclusions of the previous chapters. This is related to the idea of the `turn to the subject', which is itself analysed in terms of the centrality of the will and the loss of transcendence. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=144))
- there is no common or unitary core of doctrine, indeed, arguably, no single (relevant and sufficiently specified) doctrine which anybody who wishes to qualify as a liberal must hold. It is better to think in terms of an overlapping range of beliefs, none of which individually a liberal must hold, but to some interpretation of which, when taken together, a liberal must subscribe. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=499))
- At the heart of liberalism lies a conception of the human agent. This has two aspects. The first concerns the relation of individuals to their ends and obligations. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=502))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- The self is fundamentally detached from contingencies, being related to them (if at all) through choice or consent: whether or not this is raised to an explicit metaphysical claim, it generally implies that individuals are taken to be sovereign choosers, free to revise their ends as they wish, bound by nothing to which they have not consented, the ultimate authorities on how they should lead their lives. In one form this may simply be the claim that every individual must answer to God, and therefore that each has the responsibility to decide his or her religion; in another form it may be a claim about the value of self-chosen lives; in a strong form, it may… ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=503))

- Concerning property, the dominant strand of opinion is that absolute private property is necessary to individual freedom. This is argued (especially in classical liberalism) from the right of every individual to self-ownership (that is, the right to control the use of his or her talents) to ensure liberty. By extension, it is usually claimed that the effective exercise of self-possession requires private property, since under communal… ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=554))

- As regards the relation of equality and liberty, liberals have often been criticized, most naturally by Marxists and other socialists, for emphasizing the latter at the expense of the former. However, equality has always been a feature of the liberal tradition, at least at the level of its formal commitments:106 contractarianism posits that individuals are equal in the state of nature, and utilitarianism assumes that each counts for one, and nobody for more than one, in its calculation of utilities.

- Dewey clearly was optimistic, valued education, and tended to attribute evil to ignorance or `cultural lag'. His epistemology, stressing experimentation rather than reflection, demands public and self-corrective enquiry for knowledge to flourish. This in turn requires a free and courageous democratic community, employing intelligence and scientific method to reconstruct its self-understanding, and so to adjust `that body of traditions which constitute the actual mind of man to scientific tendencies and political aspirations which are novel and incompatible with received authorities'.10' This is connected with a theory of the self as social in nature, so that socialmodifications are `the only means of the creation of changed personalities';107 and in particular as malleable by education, which was `the fundamental method of social progress and reform' and `the deepest and best guaranty of a larger society which is worthy, lovely and harmonious'.108 But Dewey was also aware of human limitations, that there is disappointment and loss: although hopeful and reformist, he was never utopian.109 Thus in… ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=870))

- An Augustinian understanding of the relation of time and eternity would accept that history is inscrutable to the human mind; its meaning is written in the scroll which can only be opened by the victorious Lamb (Rev. 5: 1-7). It would also agree that there will be no perfection in history: human sinfulness implies that whatever historical progress there is will not have the finality which is attributed to it by progressivist philosophies of history, and that politics will never achieve more than a relative justice or harmonization of interests. Again, Niebuhr's assertion of the necessity of grace is important: the eschatological transformation is shown thereby to come from beyond the natural, being neither demanded by anything immanent in creation, nor a reaction to the course that history has taken. In rebutting human misunderstandings and judging pretensions, grace destroys not nature, but creaturely transgressions of the created limits. Likewise, the fulfilment of history in eternity does not render history meaningless: its completion beyond its intrinsic possibilities does not nullify the significance of relative good and evil. Finally, an Augustinian would accept that… ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNYGBJ0&location=908))
