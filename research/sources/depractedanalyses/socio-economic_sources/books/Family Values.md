### Highlights

- Certainly Gary Becker, the Chicago school economist singled out as exemplary by Michel Foucault, understood the breakdown of the Fordist family wage to be the critical event of his time, and one whose reverberations could be discerned in everything from shifting race relations to the recomposition of the labor market and the changing imperatives of social welfare.4 In eff ect, while it lasted, the Fordist family wage not only functioned as a mechanism for the normalization of gender and sexual relationships, but it also stood at the heart of the midcentury organization of labor, race, and class, defining African American men by their exclusion from the male breadwinner wage and African American women by their relegation to agricultural and domestic labor in the service of white households.

- In his signature work of historical sociology, The Great Transformation (1944), Polanyi distinguishes laissez- faire capitalism from all previous economies of exchange by virtue of the fact that it strives to include what was once inalienable within the ambit of exchange value.20 Reaching its purest form in nineteenth- century England, Polanyi sees modern capitalism as inhabited by a relentless calculative drive that submits even foundational social values such as labor, land, and money to the metrics of commodity exchange. Under the conditions of modern capitalism, human labor itself loses any intrinsic value and sees its price fixed by the highest bidder; money is subject to the nominal measure of interest and exchange rates; and the price of land is determined by the fluctuations of speculative value. Thus, essential social properties that should by rights function as foundations and anchors to any stable system of exchange are set to circulate in the open market as “fictitious commodities.” Having posited Aristotle’s household economy of measured exchange as ethical reference point, Polanyi can only envisage these innovations as departures from a transcendant norm of economic justice. Polanyi understands modern capitalism as the generalization of Aristotle’s “chrematistics” — an economic regime in which the perverse logic of self- multiplying value has overtaken and subsumed the measured reproduction of foundational social values.21 ([Location 6118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=6118))
- This book assumes instead that what Polanyi calls the “double movement” would be better understood as fully internal to the dynamic of capital. ([Location 6993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=6993))
- Isn’t it compelled, in the last instance, to reinstate the family as the elementary legal form of private wealth accumulation? ([Location 7430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=7430))
- Accordingly, this book takes neoliberalism and the new social conservatism as the contemporary expression of capital’s double movement. In doing so, I follow Wendy Brown, whose seminal essay “American Nightmare” argues that neoliberalism and neoconservatism must be thought together — in their convergences, collisions, and symbioses — if we are to understand the political rationality of power in the United States today.33 ([Location 8302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=8302))
- The “new” in “new social conservatism” serves to distinguish these various currents from the traditionalist or Burkean conservatism of the American paleoconservatives, whose antistatism, anti- Semitism, and ([Location 8741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=8741))
- In short, it was only when the liberation movements of the 1960s began to challenge the sexual normativity of the family wage as the linchpin and foundation of welfare capitalism that the neoliberal–new social conservative alliance came into being. What they proposed in response to this “crisis” was not a return to the Fordist family wage (this particular nostalgia would be the hallmark of the left), but rather the strategic reinvention of a much older, poor- law tradition of private family responsibility, using the combined instruments of welfare reform, changes to taxation, and monetary policy. Under their influence, welfare has been transformed from a redistributive program into an immense federal apparatus for policing the private family responsibilities of the poor, while deficit spending has been steadily transferred from the state to the private family.

- As an instrument of redistribution, the standard Fordist wage actively policed the boundaries between women and men’s work and white and black men’s labor, and in its social- insurance dimensions, it was inseparable from the imperative of sexual normativity. The Fordist politics of class was itself a form of identity politics inasmuch as it established white, married masculinity as a point of access to full social protection.

- Today the politics of distribution is no longer channeled through the instrument of the Fordist family wage and (as Thomas Piketty has shown) is much more heavily influenced by the wealth- transmitting mechanism of private inheritance than it was in the postwar era.46 ([Location 10488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071WNQPL1&location=10488))
- itself. By revisiting and questioning established historical accounts of the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, I seek to show that the question of family was as central to the formation of a postKeynesian capitalist order as it was to welfare state capitalism, and therefore it cannot be ignored without profoundly misrepresenting the political history of the era. Unlike many on the left, the key actors of the neoliberal– new social conservative alliance had no hesitation in recognizing the family as the locus of crisis. These actors were in no doubt that the grand macroeconomic issues of the time, from inflation to budget deficits to ballooning welfare budgets, reflected an ominous shift in the sexual and racial foundations of the Fordist family. Given this assessment, they could see only one possible solution: the wholesale reinvention of the American family itself. This book will be dedicated to the project of exploring how this process of reinvention was conceived and how it eventually overtook the intellectual ambitions of its authors.
