### Highlights

- For decades, the divide between winners and losers has been deepening—poisoning our politics, setting us apart. Since the 1980s and 1990s, governing elites carried out a neoliberal globalization project that brought massive gains for those at the top but job loss and stagnant wages for most working people. The proponents argued that the gains to the winners could be used to compensate globalization’s losers. But the compensation never arrived. The winners used their bounty to buy influence in high places and consolidate their winnings. Government ceased to be a counterweight to concentrated economic power. Democrats and Republicans joined in deregulating Wall Street, reaping handsome campaign contributions. When the financial crisis of 2008 brought the system to the brink, they spent billions to bail out the banks but left ordinary homeowners to fend for themselves.

- Anger at the bailout and the offshoring of jobs to low-wage countries fueled populist protest across the political spectrum—on the left, the Occupy movement and Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016; on the right, the Tea Party movement and the election of Trump.

- Four decades of neoliberal governance had brought inequalities of income and wealth not seen since the 1920s. Social mobility stalled. Under relentless pressure from corporations and their political allies, labor unions went into decline. Productivity increased, but workers received a smaller and smaller share of what they produced. Finance claimed a growing share of corporate profits but invested less in new productive enterprises than in speculative activity that did little to help the real economy. Rather than contend directly with inequality and stagnant wages, the mainstream parties told workers to improve themselves by getting a college degree.

- Democracy’s discontent persists. Abetted by pandemic, hyper partisanship, recalcitrant racial injustice, and toxic social media, the discontent is now more acute than it was a quarter century ago—more rancorous, even lethal.

- Workers whose livelihoods were tied to neighborhood and place took note. The new way of organizing economic activity heightened inequality, eroded the dignity of work, and devalued national identity and allegiance. For the winners, the political divide that mattered was no longer left versus right but open versus closed. Those who questioned free trade agreements, the offshoring of jobs to low-wage countries, and the unfettered flow of capital across national borders were cast as close-minded, as if opposition to neoliberal globalization were on a par with bigotry. By this logic, patriotism seemed atavistic, a flight from the open, frictionless world that beckoned, a consolation for the left-behind.

- Brexit and the border wall both symbolized a backlash against a market-driven, technocratic mode of governing that had produced job loss, wage stagnation, rising inequality, and the galling sense among working people that elites looked down on them. The votes for Brexit and for Trump were anguished attempts to reassert national sovereignty and pride. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=231))
- Self-government requires that political institutions hold economic power to democratic account. It also requires that citizens identify sufficiently with one another to consider themselves engaged in a common project. Today, both conditions are in doubt. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=237))
- These two aspects of our predicament—unaccountable economic power and entrenched polarization—are connected. Both disempower democratic politics. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=248))
- The culture wars are so contentious, and so irresistible, that they distract us from working together to unrig the system. Those who foment and inflame these wars help insulate economic arrangements from broad-based movements for reform. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=250))
- How can we reconfigure the economy to make it amenable to democratic control? And how can we reconstruct our social life to ease the polarization and enable Americans to become effective democratic citizens? ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=256))
- Unwinding the oligarchic capture of democratic institutions depends on empowering citizens to think of themselves as participants in a shared public life. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=260))
- this is too narrow a way of thinking about the economy. It wrongly assumes that the purpose of an economy is to maximize the welfare of consumers. But we are not only consumers; we are also democratic citizens. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=281))
- As citizens we have a stake in creating an economy hospitable to the project of self-government. This means that economic power must be subject to democratic control. It also requires that everyone be able to earn a decent living under dignified conditions, have a voice in the workplace and in public affairs, and have access to a broadly diffused civic education that equips them to deliberate about the common good. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B3JSJ8T2&location=282))
- One of the aims of Democracy’s Discontent, the old edition and the new, is to ask whether the empowering, democratic strand of our civic tradition might help us imagine an alternative to the neoliberal, technocratic mode of economic argument familiar in our time.
