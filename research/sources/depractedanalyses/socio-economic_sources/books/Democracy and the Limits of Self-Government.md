### Highlights

- The new catch phrase became “quality of democracy.” And it should be. As I look back, I cannot help but think that the world has become much better if this is what we worry about. Only now can people around the world engage in the luxury of taking a critical look at democracy. And they are taking that look. Moreover, as democracies emerged under exotic conditions, the complacency about institutional blueprints was shaken. Even the most parochial area students of them all–Americanists–ventured into a world outside the U.S. Congress, only to discover what a unique institution it is. Although the very first attempts to look beyond were terribly naive, some in fact just mindlessly arrogant– “imitate the U.S. institutions” –it quickly became apparent that democracy can come in all forms of variations and gradations. If we are to understand democracy, we have to be able to think of Chile, Poland, and the United States at the same time.

- According to the Freedom House, for example, citizens of the United States are free. They are free to vote, free to express their views in public, to form associations and political parties –except that almost one-half do not vote even in presidential elections, public speech is not free but sponsored by private interests, and no parties are ever formed. Are they free? To paraphrase Rosa Luxemburg, is one free or can one only act freely? ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3URCDG&location=194))
- Democracy is a system of positive rights but it does not automatically generate the conditions necessary for exercising these rights ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3URCDG&location=198))
- We tend to confuse the ideals of founders for a description of really existing institutions. This ideological veil deforms our understanding and our evaluations. It is politically pernicious because it simultaneously feeds unreasonable hopes, including quite a few hallucinatory projects, and blinds us to feasible reforms.

- “Democracy,” with all its changing meanings, has recurrently confronted four challenges that continue to feed widespread and intense dissatisfaction today. These are (1) the incapacity to generate equality in the socioeconomic realm, (2) the incapacity to make people feel that their political participation is effective, (3) the incapacity to ensure that governments do what they are supposed to do and not do what they are not mandated to do, and (4) the incapacity to balance order and noninterference.

- Thus, the big question is which of these “incapacities” are contingent–specific to particular conditions and institutional arrangements, and thus remediable–and which are structural, inherent in any system of representative government.

- Today democrats are those who cherish the trio of representative institutions, equality of all, and liberty for all. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3URCDG&location=332))
- Madison’s (Federalist #55) words, “Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.” ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3URCDG&location=336))
- As I see it, this ideal was self-government of the people. Again, even if etymologically it is nothing but “democracy”–demokratia=demos (people)+kraiten (rule)–it is important to remember that this ideal was not imported from Ancient Greece.3 It advanced gradually to become a novel construction that took liberty as the paramount political value and went on to claim that this value can be achieved only if people are governed only by the laws they themselves determine and to which they are equally subject. The “civil constitution,” to use Kant’s (1881 [1793]: 35) formulation, was to be based on “1. The Liberty of every Member of the Society as a Man, 2. The Equality of every Member of the Society with every other, as a Subject, 3. The Self-Dependency [self-determination] of every Member of the Commonwealth, as a Citizen.” The people should be the only sovereign; it should rule itself; all people in plural should be treated as equals; and their lives should be free from undue interference by others, including the government. This ideal was theirs and it is ours. As Skinner (1973: 299) would insist almost two centuries later, democracy is a system in which people rule, not anything else.
