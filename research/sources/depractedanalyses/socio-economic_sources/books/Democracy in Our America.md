### Highlights

- This material inequality is real and troubling, but it would be a mistake to focus on it as the fundamental explanation for the state of American politics. Facts do not generate political responses. It is the other way around: political responses identify which facts matter and how they matter. Inequality and economic insecurity gain their political salience against the background of changing beliefs and practices. Voters make judgments based on their expectations and their values. These, in turn, are a function of how they imagine themselves and their communities. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=73))
- Right-wing and left-wing populism look at the same inequalities but see the facts differently. To explain political responses, we must pay attention to forms of communication, the cultivation of resentment, the collapse of traditional civil society institutions and authorities, and the character of family life and religious practices. We have to expand our inquiry to look at how people live and work today, how they experience their communities of home, religion, work, and politics. If we seek to explain national politics by looking primarily to the collapsed economies of the Rust Belt and Appalachia, we will miss the broader picture of what is happening to democracy in America. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=77))
- Our unhappy politics reflects our unhappy lives. We need, accordingly, to have a better sense of the sources and character of that unhappiness. Why so much tension, anxiety, and anger—well before the pandemic arrived? ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=83))
- The measure of success of a work in political theory lies less in the creativity of its proposals than in its calling to mind practices and beliefs that have slipped from view. The task is not to invent something new but to recover what we may be losing. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=89))
- I am hardly the first person to see the vital connection between volunteering and the quality of democratic life. Alexis de Tocqueville was the first, and there have been many since. He, too, turned to the New England town to learn about the state of American politics. Killingworth poses the political question we all face: Are we to be a nation of aggrieved voters, or are we to be citizen volunteers seeking to create and maintain a self-governing community? ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=143))
- Until vaccines became widely available in the first half of 2021, we were unable to contain the pandemic. We certainly had the ability to do so; we lacked the political will. Our initial response looked more like that of Brazil, Mexico, and Russia than that of Germany, Taiwan, Australia, or New Zealand. We had the material resources of the latter nations but the politics of the former. Like them, we were led by an authoritarian populist. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=201))
- state where 40 percent of the voters are prepared to support a populist authoritarian is already a fragile democracy. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=229))
- Citizens can choose to reevaluate laws and reconstruct institutions. They can do this within or without the ordinary institutions of change, including the process of constitutional amendment. But if these choices are made casually or thoughtlessly, or if they are based on hatred directed at other members of the polity, then democracy has taken a pathological turn. Our democracy took a pathological turn in 2016. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=233))
- fragility of our democracy lies in an absence of citizen commitment to the necessary institutions of our political life. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=236))
- By 2016, many voters approached politics as a form of entertainment: a competition between red and blue teams with no clear rules except winner takes all. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=243))
- Of those who voted for Trump, few had any idea what policies he would pursue. That Trump’s support remained stable over his entire administration suggests that voters were not moved by expectations respecting particular policies. He promised better health insurance, more manufacturing, a rebound of the coal industry, and infrastructure investment. He promised that Mexico would pay for a border wall and that he would restore law and order. None of this happened, but that made no difference to his base. More surprising, even his failure to respond in a timely fashion to the pandemic and the recession that accompanied it made little difference to his supporters. Team loyalty mattered most. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=245))
- He would, they thought, be checked by the courts, the press, the independent agencies, the political exigencies of Congress and the state houses, and by allies and international institutions. By 2020, most of those domestic institutions had been undermined, and America was in retreat around the world. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=252))
- At the end of his term, Barack Obama’s approval rating was close to 60 percent.7 Employment was back to what it had been before the 2009 recession.8 The American troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan had declined from about 140,000 to about 15,000.9 There was growing unhappiness with income inequality, but there was no social crisis drawing masses of people into the streets to demand regime change. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=257))
- No one quite knew what political vision drove the administration, beyond Trump’s personal self-aggrandizement.12 This confusion of personal power with political institutions is characteristic of populist autocratic regimes. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=272))
- At no point in Trump’s administration, however, was there any acknowledgment of the idea of law as a limit on power. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=309))
- Just as the institutions of legality were attacked, so was the exercise of free speech. The American constitutional regime has tightly bound democracy to the rule of law, on the one hand, and to free speech, on the other. These twin pillars of law and freely formed public opinion give a distinct shape to our constitutional democracy. Courts protect individual and minority rights, while the press leads the formation of public opinion by reporting on and critiquing policies, politicians, and government officials. A constitutional democracy checks democratic populism by placing legal limits on power and protecting the critical function of public opinion formation. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=320))
- Disregard for law and the attacks on the press are the tools of authoritarian regimes everywhere. Such regimes fear they cannot survive in the full light of truth, which is the object of both the judicial process and responsible reporting. The independence of the universities came under administration attack for the same reason. These attacks included persistent efforts to delegitimize academic science and to characterize campus speech as wholly corrupted by ideologically driven political correctness. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=335))
- The Trump regime may fairly be said to have attempted a “constitutional coup.”36 An ordinary coup is an extralegal seizure of power, in which the perpetrators aim to occupy government positions. A constitutional coup uses the ordinary institutions of governance to alter the basic form of government. An ordinary coup discards the mechanisms of election; a constitutional coup discards the mechanisms of constitutional amendment. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=340))
- A regime of hostility to law, minorities, immigrants, political opponents, a free press, independent agencies, civil society institutions, science, transnational institutions, and the Western alliance is simply not the liberal constitutional order that was in place up until 2016. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=352))
- This is not, however, the first time in American history that there has been an effort at regime change outside of the formal process of constitutional amendment. Most famously, Franklin Roosevelt successfully overcame the Supreme Court’s defense of a nineteenth-century regime of laissez-faire. Without formal amendment, he introduced a new constitutional regime that embraced the social welfare state with its heavy regulatory agenda. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=365))
- As my colleague Bruce Ackerman has argued, we are right to ask of informal regime change that it meets the same standards of supermajority support and sustained deliberation required of article 5 amendments. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=382))
- Roosevelt was elected four times, including a landslide in 1936, after he had introduced the policies of the New Deal.47 The supermajority requirement may seem unfair to an existing majority, but a regime change will have most of its effects on future generations. The supermajority requirement is a sort of representational stand-in for those future generations who will bear the costs of our errors. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=388))
- were Trump to be reelected by a majority in 2024—along with Republicans gaining control of the House and Senate—claims for informal amendment would look entirely different. Trump could indeed assert that he was the new Roosevelt. We are not yet done with this debate over our national regime. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=405))
- Accounts of political polarization and the rise of Trump tend to focus on one of two large themes: economic inequality or cultural disregard. The former matches the ideological inclinations of the left—workers are falling behind—and the latter matches those of the right—traditional values are not respected. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=407))
- Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the best known of these studies, tells us that we are suffering from a structural problem of capitalism itself: finance will take an increasing share of the return on investment, leaving workers (and everyone else) further and further behind. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=411))
- Progressive activists often act as if the facts of inequality—like the facts of environmental degradation or climate change—will generate their own politics. They think of their own politics as “fact based” and believe that the extension of knowledge will lead to greater political alignment with the agenda of the left. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=416))
- people—rich and poor—vote their values, not their interests.52 Or rather, they understand their interests only from within their values. I answer that we have no reason to trust their values if they are not paying attention or are paying attention only to propaganda. She responds that the problem, then, is to get them to pay attention to better sources of information. Tocqueville made the same point by speaking of “self-interest well understood.”53 The political issue, of course, is how to persuade people to understand their self-interests “well.” ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=424))
- Those who explain the state of national politics by pointing to cultural rather than economic inequality take a values approach. Right-wing populism, they argue, responds to the failure of coastal elites to respect the values and life-styles of traditional communities. These commentators see the culture wars through a lens of community disrespect rather than of class inequality.54 The problem is not simply disagreement over values—over, for example, abortion, gun ownership, religion, and gender identity. The problem is distain for those who hold so-called traditional values or who do not achieve success as measured by advanced degrees. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=430))
- The new populism makes a claim for public recognition by groups that believe they have been ignored by the traditional leadership of both political parties. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=439))
- Perception across a cultural and geographic divide, however, is likely to be inaccurate in both directions. Propagandists on the right want to convince voters from these communities that a cosmopolitan elite views them as morally offensive. They are matched by propagandists on the left trying to convince voters that government elites are controlled by global capitalists and financiers intent on denying a living wage to the working class. The two views are not wholly incompatible, which is why there is always hope for a convergence of left and right at the extremes. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=457))
- But both of these accounts direct attention away from the fact that the beneficiaries of the modern social welfare state have largely been the white working class. There is a good deal of irony in the image of lower-middle-class citizens asserting that government has ignored them while they enjoy the benefits of Medicare and Social Security—the largest domestic welfare programs.58 These programs substantially eliminated abject poverty among the elderly by addressing the structural subordination of the working class—particularly the white working class.59 ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=461))
- The story is much the same across the federal government’s regulatory agenda. Cleaning the nation’s air and water, for example, is not a project only for elites but a direct, life-enhancing benefit to the poor and lower middle class. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=467))
- Claims of cultural disregard and economic inequality also ignore the millions upon millions of lower-middle-class and poor families who have been the beneficiaries of the Obama administration’s extension of health insurance. If we measure concern by action, the powerful center of modern American domestic politics has been the welfare of the working class. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=475))
- much of our modern politics has focused on amelioration of the conditions of the working class. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=478))
- one can recognize the material benefits of national programs but still believe that they express an elite paternalism joined with cultural distain. For this reason, arguments about the facts may have little effect on political beliefs. Passing legislation that extended health insurance to millions of lower-income Americans did not persuade Trump’s constituents that government was acting on their behalf. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=479))
- Trump spoke of “a war on Christmas.” His support is strongest among evangelicals. Again, we need to separate propaganda from policy. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 was introduced by Chuck Schumer in the House and Ted Kennedy in the Senate. It passed unanimously in the House and lost only three votes in the Senate; it was signed by President Bill Clinton.62 Many of the religious victories in the Supreme Court in recent years have been based on this act, including the recognition of religious exceptions to Obamacare’s requirement that employers support health insurance coverage of employees’ access to reproductive-health services. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=484))
- People’s attitudes emerge from the meanings already at work in their lives. These meanings are not abstract norms. They are created and sustained in common practices—in the way we speak and listen to each other, lend our support, or express our disapproval. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=492))
- In a democracy, contributing to public opinion formation is itself an important political activity. That contribution begins with participation in a common world of information, observation, and discussion. James Madison observed in the Federalist No. 49 that “all governments rest on opinion.” Not the facts, but how we account for them, drives our political practices. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=503))
- For the political right, government is the enemy, working with intellectual and cultural elites against the interests of the people. Many believe that scientists conspire against God and free enterprise, minorities and women unfairly displace white men through affirmative action, immigrants invade the nation, unborn babies are killed, and free markets promote well-being. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=507))
- For the political left, everything is the opposite: government is a progressive force, the elites who are working against the people are the corporations and banks, science is the only rational basis for policy, structural racism is a deep and abiding reality, women have a right to control their own bodies, and unregulated markets favor the wealthy. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=509))
- Shifts in technology have consequences beyond their information content. This was no less true in the time of Martin Luther than it is in the time of Mark Zuckerberg. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=538))
- A similar story can be told about the emergence of the political lecture in the nineteenth century. Here, too, expectations had been formed by religious practice—in this instance, the sermon. In the eighteenth century, Killingworth residents spent their Sundays listening to the Congregational pastor speak for many hours. By the nineteenth century, public speaking was a critical part of the democratic political project. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=548))
- The revival meetings that marked the first and second Great Awakenings had effectively modeled a new form of political engagement. Something of this tradition continues in the evangelical meeting quality of the Trump rally. Not only did Trump appear with evangelical preachers, but he appeared in place of them. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=555))
- the most important form of political communication today—especially for Trump—is Twitter.78 This is politics for those whose attention span has been reduced to seconds. Politics appears within an endless stream of messaging that randomly juxtaposes life-and-death matters with celebrity revelations, photos of friends, and chatter about families and travel. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=567))
- One hundred fifty years ago, it was hard to know where religion ended and politics began. Today, we do not know where entertainment ends and politics begins. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=571))
- There was, until 1987, a federal “fairness doctrine,” requiring broadcasters to recognize their public responsibility to provide “balanced” coverage of contending political positions.82 Rush Limbaugh’s radio show began one year after the fairness doctrine was abolished. Conservative talk radio exploited the new deregulation of the airways, just as Fox News exploited the new digital access of cable. The new social media have no memory of the fairness doctrine. For them, public service journalism was not even a question until the backlash to their facilitation of extravagant misrepresentations in the 2016 election. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=577))
- Conservative talk radio also had to enthrall an audience for hours on end. Both forms of communication—the talk show host going on for hours and the endless social media account—are designed to allow viewers and listeners to easily come in and out. Content must be transitory yet support a single, broad narrative that is immediately accessible whenever a listener arrives. Outrage at elites serves these ends. So, however, does outrage at Trump. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=589))
- When politics is an element of the entertainment business, we do not know what is serious and what is not. At a Trump rally, were those chants of “Lock her up!” politics or entertainment? They were politics become entertainment—a mob whipped into a destructive passion.85 Lynchings, too, were once entertainment. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=592))
- candidate Trump: an entertainer threatening violence and reveling in pornographic behavior. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=611))
- Trump’s Access Hollywood sex tape, for example, had little effect on his public standing because, for an electorate whose political expectations were shaped by entertainment, it presented nothing new. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=612))
- By the beginning of the new millennium, both the old and the new media were treating politics as a form of entertainment. Traditional media approached politics as if it were more like a sports competition than a debate. The networks emphasized who was ahead, who had a good week or a bad week, who was gaining or losing. This horse-race model is coupled to a focus on personal interest stories, again as if the media were covering athletes. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=613))
- While traditional media were trying to create interest in politics as a competitive sport, their competitors were covering politics as if it were pornography. Pornography trades on fantasy and scandal, not truth. In 2016, Trump was the candidate of sexual transgression. News in the mode of pornography is not simply covering a campaign; it is participating in it. Is Fox News or Newsmax a news source, an entertainment venue, or an arm of the Trump political apparatus? What is Breitbart? Or is Trump himself better understood as an element of an entertainment empire? In a politics of entertainment, the traditional distinction between public and private disappears just as surely as that between fact and fiction. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=621))
- Distinctions between truth and falsehood, and between fact and opinion, simply do not count in a world of entertainment. We do not ask if entertainment is true; we ask whether it holds our attention. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=627))
- For the modern political campaign, data analysis is far more important than endorsement by opinion leaders. Indeed, the whole idea of endorsement seems antiquated.92 Instead of endorsements by opinion leaders, good polling numbers by themselves add to a candidate’s attractiveness. To follow politics today is to read polls, not editorials. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=634))
- Trump’s support of the birther movement, which carried him to political prominence, enabled him to overcome his reputation as an unethical real-estate developer. The success of that movement tells us a great deal about his voters. The birthers made a claim of fact, suggesting hidden knowledge, and linked it to a claim of conspiracy perpetrated by threatening forces—Muslims, socialists, and the deep state. They invented an anticolonialist socialist out of Barack Obama’s father; foreign birth out of dark skin; and Muslim faith out of time abroad. The birthers did not say that they disagreed with President Obama’s policies; they attacked his legitimacy ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=650))
- Those opposed to the Paris Climate Accords do not say that they disagree with the government’s policy choices; they deny that global climate change is occurring.96 Again, they allege conspiracies by hidden elites. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=655))
- history matters: a left-wing populism of class never recovered from its defeats early in the twentieth century and from the failure of the union movement in the postwar decades. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=660))
- The Democrats, since the 1960s, have become a coalition of identity-driven groups, loosely aligned behind progressive policies. Their disputes are over how far left to move. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=663))
- The Republicans, during this same period, became an awkward union of a business elite and a white working-class base. The GOP’s defining problem was to hold these two wings together when their interests lay in quite different directions.98 At the heart of the party was a truth that could not be spoken: neither wing cared for or had any interest in the other’s success. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=664))
- Two trends, accelerating in the 1970s, were especially important to the development of the modern Republican Party. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=669))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- First, there was a movement toward a global regulatory order. Global markets require global regulation. In earlier eras, that order was produced by hegemonic colonial powers. After the Second World War, hegemony took the form of American-driven transnational institutions in which states would participate on a formally equal basis. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=670))
- Second, and more or less simultaneously, the Republican base was shifting in reaction to the progressive movements of the 1960s. It became increasingly white, male, and fundamentalist. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=673))
- Early capitalism required an aggressive state to open and maintain markets—foreign and domestic—and to create an orderly property and contract regime.100 Late capitalism requires an aggressive state to maintain a transnational legal order and to regulate global competition. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=677))
- The new globalism required professional administrators: an international class of policy analysts, lawyers, financiers, and managers. This was the promise of the American era of global hegemony. It was also the promise of the European Union and, more recently, the promise of a newly emergent China, which needs the WTO no less than its competitors do. Schools of public policy, business, law, and management flourished. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=685))
- This elite easily moved back and forth between the private sector and public administration, as well as across borders. Their common backgrounds and interests led them to see problems and solutions in the same way. They shared a belief in neoliberalism and generally paid little attention to social and economic divisions within nations. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=688))
- As the neoliberal trade regime was expanding, the Republican Party was reacting to the cultural and political upheavals of the 1960s. By the 1970s, the antiwar movement, the civil rights movement, and the feminist movement had converged to create an impression of popular consensus around a progressive social agenda. Young people were bringing the culture of the university into the mainstream of American… ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=691))
- Each of these movements triggered its own opposition, and these merged to form the base of the modern Republican Party. The antiwar movement brought forth an opposition organized around claims of respect for the military and a more militarized foreign policy. The civil rights movement brought forth an opposition in defense of… ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=696))

- The new party had to meld a right-wing populism—nationalist, racist, antifeminist, and evangelical—to the very different conservativism of the business elite. “Values conservatism,” supported largely by non-college-educated whites living outside urban areas, entered a forced marriage with “market conservativism,” whose… ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=704))
- Republican voters were increasingly culturally driven nationalists, while Republican funders were corporate interests. The former were antielitist; the latter were the elite. The former were suspicious of anything beyond the nation’s borders, of university-based expertise, and of claims for diversity. The latter affirmed all of these. This uneasy union of opposites was entirely visible in the Republican… ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=707))
- The two wings found common ground in their fear of the left. Even here, however, there were differences. The corporate elite feared that the left would pursue redistributive policies both domestically and internationally. The populists had no reason to oppose redistribution—they were the beneficiaries of the largest of these programs, Social Security and… ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=712))
- The corporate elite had no reason to oppose the progressives’ cultural and social ambitions. In the places where they lived and worked, no one wanted to think of themselves as racist, sexist, or nationalist. They attended the same universities, lived in the same neighborhoods, and often exchanged the… ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=716))

- A party unable or unwilling to deliver programs that advanced its base’s economic well-being had no choice but to raise its attacks on opponents to an ever-higher pitch.

- This pattern of alternative experts creating a space for the mythical imagination came to characterize right-wing populist politics in diverse fields. Exxon, for example, funded research designed to question climate change well after its own scientists concluded that climate change was indeed a fact.108 The tobacco industry funded research to deny the health consequences of smoking. The attack on the science easily morphed into an attack on the scientists as conspiring elites.109 No reasonably well educated person, including those running the corporations, believed these claims, but educated people were not the audience.

- Practicing politics as entertainment, Trump gave voice to emotions and beliefs that are not ordinarily expressed in public debate. In 2016, he accused Hillary Clinton of being a criminal, a sexual predator, and a national security threat. This is the standard practice of propaganda: to invert the truth. It was, after all, Trump who allegedly committed fraud, practiced sexual predation, and posed a national security threat.

- mind-boggling claims, which was just their point: to disorient anyone who tried to take his speech seriously while exciting his supporters by pushing the borders of the outrageous. Trump’s claims of massive election fraud in 2020 had the same character. As he tried to persuade Republican officials to discard the actual votes in their states, he made more and more extreme claims of fraud—claims that no court would accept but that his followers believed.

- our situation may better be described as a civil war. A civil war occurs when conflict is beyond the power of ordinary political institutions to resolve. Today, neither elections nor court judgments can resolve our differences. Similarly, representative institutions, including Congress, are incapable of resolving differences. They, too, have become sites of polarized conflict. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=779))
- In America today, we are past the point at which the red and the blue constitute a single national community. Each side has pulled away from the other; neither has sympathy for the other. This is why Trump’s support remained stable even as a pandemic swept the country. Neither the nation of the red nor that of the blue can imagine moving to the other side. That would be defeat at best and treason at worst. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=788))
- In this conflict, issues are symbols—markers of the divide—not problems to be solved. This extends from guns to abortion, from Christian fundamentalism to pandemic relief.

- Government alone cannot make society democratic. Conversely, an egalitarian society alone will not sustain democratic government.

- Tocqueville worries that democracies, when they lose stable internal articulation, empower mobs, and mobs elect tyrants.28 He believes that Americans, partly by chance, had found a set of midlevel institutions to break the tendency toward political centralization and thus toward authoritarianism.

- Tocqueville does not look at laws and institutions as the products of an abstract science of politics—the view of many of the Founders.32 He does not think America’s Founders were better at political science than European politicians were. Rather, he studies the way in which legal and political institutions have a kind of symbiotic relationship with beliefs and practices concerning religion, family, gender, community, and commerce. He is interested in forms of spontaneous association, the ways in which people organize to express themselves and get things done. He studies democracy as a set of beliefs and social practices that sustain the ordinary affairs of life within self-governing communities. Before there are laws, there are mores. He is the first social theorist to focus on the importance of civil society to the character of political institutions. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1176))
- What to Tocqueville seemed a balance between social equality and political participation has now become a substantial imbalance. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1216))
- The founders of the American political project understood that a democracy cannot be better than its citizens. Government institutions might be designed to be “a machine that would go of itself,” but absent character, that machine will run itself into the ground.40 When Benjamin Franklin spoke of a “republic, if you can keep it,” he was gesturing toward citizen character. George Washington’s Farewell Address, too, spoke of the need for character, if the nation was to survive its infancy.41 Character was at the heart of Tocqueville’s inquiry. He looked for the ground of character in practices of religion, education, commerce, family, and informal associations. He thought all of these factors worked together to support local, self-government. From there, they could inform national political practices. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1230))
- A more inclusive vision, however, will not make democratic government run of itself. Participation without character can veer into authoritarian populism. This may not have been evident in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, when neoliberals proposed market-based solutions to most problems of governance. By 2020, it was the “democracy problem” everywhere. ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1241))
- We are today at the far end of the growth of an ideology of equality. We are also at the far end of a decline in the kind of civil society Tocqueville observed. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1251))
- Absent that civil society, the line of transmission of values reverses. Instead of local virtues informing national politics, the character of national politics dominates local practices and beliefs.

- The town was thriving at the intersection of two distinctly American narratives: one expressing optimism about the possibility of individual accomplishment, the other, nostalgia for a traditional community. These stories embody different ideas of liberty: the former emphasizes a lack of dependence on others; the latter emphasizes membership in a self-governing community. On the first view, liberty lies in the individual alone; on the second, it is the ability to work with others in a community of equals. Autonomy and community are my themes in the next two chapters. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1288))
- Autonomy is expressed in the classic narrative of the American dream: a story of individual opportunity, hard work, and economic advance.1 “Advance” often suggests movement—first immigration across the ocean and then onward to a frontier that, by the end of the nineteenth century, was increasingly metaphorical. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1292))
- Their ideal of suburban life did not yet include the dream of purchasing private services and activities. Three decades later, developers were building homes that represent the privatization of success not as necessity but as luxury. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1305))
- Some people, however, embraced the second view of liberty: they moved to Killingworth not for a bigger house but for the life of a small town—a place away from the intense competition, endless professional demands, and affective anonymity of urban living. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1308))
- When the economic crisis hit in 2008, those who had come to Killingworth in pursuit of the first version of liberty had little sense of community to fall back on. As property values in town declined and some of the larger employers—Pfizer in Groton, Bristol-Myers Squibb in Wallingford—relocated out of state, residents began to sense their constrained possibilities.6 This was hardly the expected endpoint of their American dream; it gave rise to an anger that simmered just below the surface. There was urgency without direction, a sense that everything had gotten both too complicated and too expensive. It became common to hear people speak of moving to low-tax states in the South. Some of the more vocal residents actually did. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1315))
- In the competition between the supporters of autonomy and those of community, the latter are losing.7 Tocqueville worried about the stability of liberty without community in a mass democracy. Too much liberty could shift to too much equality: “Democratic peoples love equality at all times, but in certain periods, they press the passion they feel for it to delirium. This happens at the moment when the old social hierarchy, long threatened, is finally destroyed after a last internecine struggle, and the barriers that separated citizens are finally overturned. Then men rush at equality as at a conquest, and they become attached to it as to a precious good someone wants to rob them of.” ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1321))
- When the ideal of autonomy fails, resentment is often not far behind. That can produce Tocqueville’s “delirium”: a passionate demand for equality in the form of leveling. Nationally, that phenomenon looks like Trumpism. Locally, it can look like implacable distrust of authority and suspicion of the motives of anyone who suggests a reform or a new project. Privatization in the local community opens the way for nationalization of public opinion, and vice-versa. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1327))
- The most important issue facing Killingworth today is not which party will win the next election. The deep, existential issue is whether residents will volunteer to take on the multiple tasks of self-governance. ([Location 1331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1331))
- WE OFTEN IDENTIFY DEMOCRACY WITH the voting booth. Democracy is performing better, we think, when more people vote. But voter turnout actually tells us little about the health of a democracy. A democracy flourishes when people vote for the right reasons and engage the political process in the right way. A mob at the polls is still a mob. Electoral success does not legitimate the violation of rights or the failure to respect the rule of law. It does not save citizens from suffering from mismanagement of domestic policy or dangerous foreign interventions. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1338))
- In Killingworth, the voting booth is not the fundamental site of political engagement. The town is a direct, not a representative, democracy. The citizens gathered at the Town Meeting constitute the legislative branch of town government. The formal status of the Town Meeting, however, can lead scholars to make the opposite mistake of focusing on attendance at the meeting as the proper measure of local democracy.4 The democratic life of Killingworth lies elsewhere: in the committees, boards, and civic organizations that carry out the town’s affairs and perform the work of public administration and public service.

- To participate in self-government in Killingworth is not to vote but to volunteer. It is to act with others, not to make a choice about who might act in one’s place. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1354))

- In town hall, on any weekday evening, there might be meetings of the board of selectmen, the board of finance, the zoning board of appeals, the inlands wetland commission, the planning and zoning commission, the public health committee, or an ad hoc committee planning an event like the town’s recent 350th anniversary. Elsewhere in town, the library board or the school board might be meeting, while the firemen are training. There might also be meetings of the Killingworth Women’s Organization (KWO), the Lions, or the parent-teacher organization (PTO). This is self-government as a practice of taking care.

- Politics in Killingworth does not mean campaigns; it means participation. The most important function of campaigns is to encourage further volunteerism. To run for office is to volunteer. For most of the elected offices—there were twenty-three on the last ballot—candidates do little personal campaigning, even though these are partisan elections. ([Location 1361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1361))
- Elections are a means by which neighbors take turns volunteering to help the town. Residents are “drafted” by the Democratic or Republican town committees to run. For most positions, running means little more than having one’s name posted in the party’s roster of ballot positions. Only those running for first selectman do much campaigning—and even that is a recent phenomenon. By 2019, that office had become the site of intense partisan competition; it was functioning as a proxy for our national political confrontation. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=1368))
- The first stage is formal exclusion from the institutions of self-government. Killingworth started with property, gender, and religious qualifications for participation. The second stage is granting the formal right to participate but failing to provide opportunities for its effective exercise. A legal right to vote can be undermined through public or private action—for example, inconvenient polling hours, gerrymandering, or harassment at the polls. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=2156))
- The third stage arises not from exclusion or lack of opportunity but from changes in the underlying social order such that political institutions no longer map on to civil society. ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=2160))
- In Killingworth, political frustrations arise from the institutions of direct democracy; in Washington, from the institutions of representative democracy. Everywhere, reasonable people wonder why politics is so difficult today. Tocqueville’s insight still applies: democracy without a supporting civil society may be more than we can handle. Civil society did more than bring people together in various associations. It created relationships of authority and deference: for example, minister-parishioner, teacher-student, parent-child, and professional-client. Traditional authority was as much about responsibility as about privilege. We should do away with privilege, but we cannot do away with responsibility. New England society was once surfeited with authority, but Killingworth has become a society without authority.

- Well before the normalization of the disruptive fringe in American politics, Hannah Arendt worried about the recession of political authority in modern life.5 By authority, Arendt meant a practice of regarding the past, and particularly the founding act, as a source of legitimacy. The Romans invented this idea: they understood present politics as “augmenting” the city’s founding. Politics was a structure of authority because its motivating force was to preserve and to augment, to grow from its origin. The problem of authority, accordingly, was that of establishing and maintaining a foundation. ([Location 2188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=2188))
- While the Declaration of Independence was the performative text bringing the nation into existence, the Constitution created the nation’s legal and institutional order. This idea of authority finds direct contemporary expression in originalism as a method of constitutional interpretation and in the rhetoric of our most famous presidential addresses, including Lincoln’s invocation of “our fathers” at Gettysburg. ([Location 2196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=2196))
- Arendt’s idea of authority nevertheless poses a puzzle in a democratic polity because it privileges the past over the present. It is a republican idea, not a democratic one. Its very point is to counter the political claims of a contemporary majority. This is why Arendt saw the Supreme Court as the site of political authority and also why the Court’s power is often described as “counter-majoritarian.”8 Its role is to hold the nation to its constitutional commitments.9 In Arendt’s terms, the Court’s primary responsibility is to explain how acts of government, including laws, can be seen as augmentations of the foundation.10 When no such explanation is available, the act is unconstitutional.

- However, “with public support for reform growing, a well-organized minority mobilized in opposition.” In the eyes of this “well-organized minority,” abortion was tied to the other progressive issues of the day: for example, the antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, and the prodrug liberalization movement. By 1972, this one-time minority was recast as Nixon’s Silent Majority, and the Democrats—who in 1964 won all but six states—were pilloried as the party of “Acid, Amnesty and Abortion.” ([Location 5237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=5237))
- In Tocqueville’s time, this accusation was directed against Andrew Jackson. Tocqueville was skeptical, writing that the time in America for such dictatorial undertakings had “not yet come.” Nevertheless, he continued, “General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he follows it in its wishes, its desires, its half-uncovered instinct, or rather he divines it and runs to place himself at its head.” Tocqueville, Democracy, 377.

- Bryan makes this mistake. He contrasts representative democracies with the “real democracy” of the Town Meeting: “Real democracy (for good or ill) occurs only when all eligible citizens of a general-purpose government are legislators; that is called to meet in a deliberative, face-to-face assembly and to bind themselves under laws they fashion themselves.” Frank M.

- For social scientists who model choice as a calculation of costs and benefits, government as volunteerism is a difficult concept, for the cost is always more than the benefit to the individual. Paul Peterson expresses this form of reasoning: “A convenient way of roughly calculating whether or not a policy is in the interest of a city is to consider whether its benefits/tax ratio is more or less than 1.0, that is, whether the marginal benefits exceed the marginal cost to the average taxpayer.” Paul E. Peterson, City Limits (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 42. Efforts to reconcile the fact of volunteering with the method of calculation turn to the subjective satisfactions that volunteers find in their activities. That, however, reduces governance to a hobby, which is fundamentally an antipolitical stance. ([Location 5547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BSWSXW85&location=5547))
