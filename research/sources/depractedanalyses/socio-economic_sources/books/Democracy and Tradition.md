- The more extravagant forms of Black Nationalism simply reverse the valences. That is to say, they authorize inferences concerning whiteness and blackness that invert those authorized in the social system of white superiority.

- Each section of the chapter contributes something to the case I am making for the conclusion that democratic culture is best understood as a set of social practices that inculcate characteristic habits, attitudes, and dispositions in their participants. Because those practices do involve a sort of deference to authority (as well as much defiance of authority) and have achieved enough stability to be transmitted from one generation to another, it makes sense to call them a tradition in their own right. But in working out what it means to say this, we are transcending oppositions that Burke and Paine took for granted. This, I take it, is what American pragmatism has long sought to achieve—an antitraditionalist conception of modern democracy as a tradition.

- Once upon a time, there were feudal kingdoms. In those days, rights were mainly treated as if they belonged to persons identified with particular roles. What are rights? All rights are normative social statuses. To have the status of a right is to have a legitimate claim on others for the enjoyment of a good.

- In the feudal past such statuses were determined by a hierarchically arranged set-up of persons, each of whom had his or her place in the providentially designed order of things. Because the basic social order was thought to be divinely ordained, human beings were not responsible for determining what the available roles should be. The question of who gets to play which roles was also to be answered by discerning God’s will. Occasionally, a group of religious purists would press demands for universal poverty and equal standing, but the need for some variant of the hierarchical framework was mainly taken for granted. There was… ([Location 4656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4656))
- Questions about rights tended in this setting to be of the following form: “What claims may you legitimately assert against those to whom you are bound by relations of obligation, given the stations to which you and they have been assigned by God?” The question assumed that the basic order is fixed: prince, king, father, mother, first son, second-born, mere daughter, commoner, peon, outcast, priest, bishop, pope, and so on. Your assigned roles constituted your ethical identity, your vocation. Your roles plus the relations they involved determined your obligations. The relations of role-determined obligation in which you stood determined your rights. In this linguistic setting, “dignity” was a term… ([Location 4662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4662))

- Eventually, however, church councils began to strike many Catholics as a model for more collegial, less hierarchical, exercise of authority within the church.1 And in certain places, including England, the demand of Protestant radicals for egalitarian social and political relationships made significant headway. Increasingly, people started asking about the whole setup. They began to think of the set-up itself as something for which a social group, and not just the divine source of all things, bore responsibility.2 So they began posing hard questions, not just about, say, whether a specific prince should be… ([Location 4671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4671))

- There are still role-specific rights. That is to say, there are legitimate claims that a role-occupant can make for the enjoyment of a good, given what other role-occupants owe him or her as a matter of duty . But now there are also widely recognized rights of another kind. In other words, there are legitimate claims one can make on behalf of oneself or one’s group at those points in the discussion… ([Location 4686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4686))

- In this sense rights are statuses involving legitimate claims to a social arrangement of a certain kind, a set-up capable of ensuring “that one will not be deprived of the enjoyment of the good in question by ordinary, serious, or remediable threats.”5 The linguistic innovation was to use the old word “rights” to stand for statuses involving these new sorts of legitimate claims. A parallel innovation (there were many others) was to say that everybody with the level of linguistic competence and civility needed to participate in the discussion had something called dignity.

- The various rituals of deference, and of begging and response to begging, reduce this sort of cost. We are a species who recognize status (and so avoid the war of all against all) and who have a strictly limited willingness both to beg and to give to those who beg. The conditions of the form of human justice that recognizes universal rights include not only moderate scarcity, vulnerability to the resentment of one’s fellows, and limited generosity, all of which Hume recognized, but also a limited willingness to beg, a considerable unwillingness to ask, even when—if we did ask the powerful for a handout—it would perhaps be given to us. What we regard as ours by right is what we are unwilling to beg for and willing only within limits to say “thank you” for. We seem to be getting less and less willing both to beg and to give to beggars. The increasing tendency to talk of universal rights and the extension of their content correlates with the decreasing ability to beg.6 ([Location 4698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4698))

- The problems come from asking rights-talk to do too much. When it comes time to appraise character, for example, we need to speak of virtues and vices, not of rights. But there are other linguistic tasks that are hard to accomplish without speaking of rights in the way citizens of modern democracies tend to speak of them, as legitimate claims about matters that are not merely by-products of other people’s role-specific duties.

- MacIntyre has proposed that we drop rights-talk in favor of an older moral vocabulary focused mainly on the virtues. In defense of this proposal he argues that questions of rights are inherently arbitrary and that there is no reason to suppose that basic human rights even exist.7 Belief in rights, he concludes, is on a par with belief in unicorns. ([Location 4713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4713))
- The practical worry about such proposals can be expressed in the question, “When the powerful try to shut us out or hold us down, what are we supposed to do, beg?” In a democratic culture begging and certain other expressions of deference come to seem responses unbecoming of a human being or fellow citizen. The language of rights arises in such a culture as an alternative to begging, on the one hand, and to certain kinds of coercion, such as torture and religiously motivated warfare, on the other. But it does not arise alone. Accompanying it is a significant alteration in the character traits held up for praise and blame. The members of such a culture do not stop talking about the virtues. But they are more likely than their ancestors were to look kindly on the traits in common people that would allow them to stand up before power-holders and… ([Location 4716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4716))

- One institutional constraint that matters in this context is that everybody who satisfies the minimal conditions of being able to speak and remain civil deserves a hearing. if they can avoid the posture of subordination, the conclusions they urge upon us will have some hope of being treated as the (perhaps legitimate) claims of fellow citizens, not as beggary.

- But then it isn’t always easy to discern the difference between legitimate and illegitimate claims of other kinds. Factual claims, for example, are claims about what is the case. We know what some of the legitimate factual claims are, but others remain in dispute. This is no reason to conclude that there is no such thing as a fact or that all fact-claiming is arbitrary. If facts are legitimate claims about what is the case, then if we know that there are claims about what is the case and that some of them are legitimate (that is, true), we know that there are facts.9 And if we know that the legitimacy of some claims… ([Location 4733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4733))
- Rights involve legitimate claims to the enjoyment of certain goods. We know that there are claims to the enjoyment of certain goods. People make such claims all the time. If some such claims are legitimately made on behalf of everyone—such as the claim not to be tortured and the claim to be free from humiliation—then there are human rights, and human rights are not essentially arbitrary. For rights are just statuses conferred by legitimate claims of this sort. I grant, however, that the legitimacy of some claims to the enjoyment of goods can be hard to determine.

- Who will know better what some of the relevant considerations will be than the one on whose behalfa right is claimed? All the more reason, then, to highlight one class of legitimate claims or rights, namely the ones that have directly to do with who gets to talk and with what the conversation is going to be like. Suppose the talking that went on in a given community were principally a matter of mere coercion, from which the weak could save themselves only by assuming a posture of submission. Suppose the “discussion” were essentially analogous to the decision making and conflict resolution that goes on in a pack of wolves. We would not then be prepared to count it as discourse. As democrats we would object to it unconditionally, without regard to the substance of what had been decided. A democratic claim is not something one asks for by assuming a prone position before a superior.

- We encourage the weak, the likeliest victims of exclusion or domination, to stand up and speak in a way that can be clearly distinguished from begging or beseeching. The ideal of equal voice implicit in these aspects of democratic culture is itself, of course, something one can justify, if need be, in the discussion. But as long as it does stand justified, as long as it withstands critical scrutiny in our common discussion with one another, it imposes unconditional demands—not unconditioned demands, unconditional ones. They are obviously demands shaped by actual historical conditions in which people came to be suspicious of begging and coercion as modes of conflict… ([Location 4755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4755))

- Is it true that democratic discourse, with its talk of rights, essentially eliminates deference to authority? Burke and Paine both thought of the innovation in this way; they differed over whether this made the innovation horrific or wonderful. Burke held that a society without deference to genuine authority could not last more than a generation. Paine saw Burke as an apologist for a corrupt order of power and privilege.

- The reasons exchanged in ethical discourse pertain to commitments that individuals undertake and attribute to one another. The commitments pertain to such topics as conduct, character, and community. They make essential use of evaluative concepts. They distinguish between right and wrong, justice and injustice, decency and indecency, virtue and vice, the excellent and the horrible, the good and the bad, the responsible and the irresponsible. And they often employ notions that are more specific than these, but clearly belong to the same conceptual family, such as the idea of murder or courage. Ethical reasoning, when fully expressed, involves claims, questions, arguments, narratives, examples, and various other linguistic units in terms of which ethical topics can be specified.

- Ethical discourse in any culture bears on reasons for action. It is a discursive practice because reasons, in the form of asserted claims, are among the things being exchanged in it. It is a social practice, first, because the reasons being exchanged pass from one person to another and, second, because each participant needs to keep track of the discursive process in terms of his or her own commitments. By exchanging reasons and requests for reasons with one another, participants in the practice hold one another responsible for their commitments and actions. To be able to exchange reasons for this purpose, they must be able to do certain other things as well. They must be capable of undertaking both cognitive and practical commitments. They must be able to express such commitments, by avowing them and acting on them. They must know… ([Location 4777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4777))

- “[F]or someone to undertake a commitment,” Brandom says, “is to do something that makes it appropriate to attribute the commitment to that individual” (MIE, 162; emphasis in original). Accordingly, attributing commitments to other people is one way in which we explain their behavior, including their verbal behavior. For example, if my brother is packing his bags frantically, I might infer that he is committed to the cognitive judgment that the train will be arriving shortly and that he is also committed practically to boarding the train. If he then says to me, “The train will be leaving shortly,” I will be inclined to interpret this as an assertion expressing his judgment. But as an assertion, this utterance has significance beyond the confirmation it affords me concerning his cognitive commitments, for it also serves to authorize me (and anyone to whom I repeat it) to employ it as a premise in reasoning. If I proceed to make use of the claim in a practical inference that leads me to begin packing, I will be relying on the authority conferred by my brother’s claim. I also have the authority to challenge his assertion,… ([Location 4785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4785))

- Holding one another responsible for commitments involves keeping track of the commitments we attribute to each other and of the entitlements we attribute to or withhold from the commitments thus attributed. Commitments and entitlements are socially tracked normative statuses. Participating in a discursive social practice is in part a matter of keeping track of oneself and one’s fellow participants in terms of these normative statuses (MIE, 180–98). It is an exercise in what Brandom calls normative “score keeping.” Anything we say or do can have significance in the reason giving practice we are engaged in insofar as it affects the various scorecards of discursive commitments and entitlements that each participant keeps from his or her own point of view on participants in the discursive game.

- Cognitive commitments are commitments to a claim or a judgment, whereas practical commitments are commitments to act.10 We may refer to these as beliefs and intentions, respectively.11 The point of calling them commitments is to draw attention to the appropriateness of being held responsible for them, of being deemed entitled to them or not. What is it to be entitled to a belie for an intention? It is not the same thing as being able to justify the commitment to someone else, let alone being able to justify it compellingly to all rational agents. Sometimes one is entitled to a commitment by default, without needing to offer an argument for it, provided that no one who has the authority to challenge the commitment does so (MIE, 176–78).

- When studying the ethical life of any community it is important to take note of its (implicit or explicit) way of distributing discursive authority and responsibility. Within a given discursive social practice, under what conditions is someone normally held to be entitled to certain sorts of commitments by default? Under what conditions is someone normally assumed to need to justify a commitment discursively in order to secure entitlement to it, even if no one challenges it? Who is entitled to issue challenges?Conversely, who is excluded from the roles of claim-maker and challenger?Under what conditions are challenges deemed appropriate? And when does a challenge suffice to deprive someone of entitlement to a commitment?In other words, what suffices to shift the burden of proof?

- We defer to one another’s authority on a regular basis whenever we have reason to think that doing so provides access to sound claims that will prove useful in our reasoning. Each of us considers the others to be competent readers of train schedules and skillful trackers of rights and responsibilities to which we pay close attention. Whoever has read the train schedule most recently (when alert and sober) is likely to be trusted by the others on the question of when the train is probably going to arrive. And whoever has given the most careful and disinterested thought to a particular moral issue is likely to be trusted by the others to be entitled to his or her commitments about it. We are entitled to defer in such cases because our siblings have proven their reliability in the relevant domains, and we reserve our right to challenge one another if we discover sufficient reason to doubt a claim in a particular case.

- All discursive practices involve authority and deference to some extent. The notion that ethical discourse in democratic societies is “nondeferential” therefore requires qualification. It is more accurate to say that such discourse is relatively nondeferential. The difference is a matter of how, when, and why someone defers or appeals to authority, not a matter of whether one does so at all.

- Some early defenders of modern democratic ideals wrongly sought to eliminate deference and authority from ethical discourse altogether. The theoretical consequence of this move is known as foundationalism, a doctrine that unjustifiably takes the default status of all claims to be “guilty until proven innocent.” Ascribing this default status to all claims triggers a regress of reasons that can be stopped, if at all, only in a foundation of certitudes. The best way to avoid this doctrine and the problems associated with it is to say with the pragmatists that many claims are “innocent until proven guilty—taken to be entitled commitments until and unless someone is in a position to raise a legitimate… ([Location 4853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4853))
- But this authority is, according to the pragmatists, defeasible, because other things are not always equal. At any given moment, some claims must be treated as having authority by default.

- By granting that some claims must have authority by default, and simultaneously insisting on the defeasibility of all claims, pragmatists have endeavored to reconceive the authority relations of ethical discourse democratically. This alternative to foundationalism is pragmatism’s most important contribution to democracy. For other leading alternatives to foundationalism tend to be authoritarian in the sense that they promote uncritical acquiescence in the allegedly authoritative claims of some practice, tradition, institution, person, text, or type of experience. American pragmatism differs from the version of pragmatism that Martin Heidegger accepted when he embraced Nazism precisely in its principled scorn for unquestioning acquiescence in authority of any kind.12 The new traditionalism that I examined in… ([Location 4865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4865))

- Burke’s traditionalism explicitly endorsed a type of authoritarianism, whereas Paine’s antiauthoritarianism implicitly committed him to foundationalism. From a pragmatic point of view , neither of these positions can survive criticism. Burke and Paine were therefore both wrong in the positions they tried to maintain and both right in identifying the flaws in the other’s position. Pragmatism splits the difference by reconceiving authority in nonauthoritarian terms.

- In the heat of the moment, the defenders and critics of representative democracy often depicted it as a complete break with the past. But a retrospective view teaches that this is not so, at least if the debate between Burke and Paine is any indication. Both of these men saw modern democracy as utterly discontinuous with what had gone before. In fact, we may owe the theme of revolutionary discontinuity to them. Looking back, however, it is easy to locate them both within the same broad tradition of European thought—Burke struggling to hold several different strands of that tradition together, Paine convinced that the democratic-republican strand he favored was ultimately incompatible with the others. The two men shared more assumptions and concepts than anyone could enumerate. Recall in this connection the surprise and shock Paine felt when Burke, the man who had written the “Speech on Conciliation” with the American colonies, a work that contributed to Burke’s reputation as a great critic of British imperial rule, published Reflections on the Revolution in France. ([Location 4889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4889))
- Paine, of course, is out to debunk the culture of chivalry as a set of props designed to mask the operations of tyranny . “It is by distortedly exalting some men,” he writes, “that others are distortedly debased, till the whole is out of nature. A vast mass of mankind are degradedly thrown into the background of the human picture, to bring forward with greater glare, the puppet-show of state and aristocracy” (59). Where Burke enjoins deference, Paine typically requests a reason or asserts an objection. It is crucial from his point of view to create a citizenry that is not disposed to bow and scrape before the holders of high office. The thousands of ordinary people in England who learned to read in order to read the radical pamphleteers of the 1790s and early 1800s had before them unmistakable models of non-deferential behavior.

- We have seen that Burke opposed the Revolution and deferred to certain figures of authority, while Paine differed from him on both points. These are differences in action. The two men also endorsed somewhat different norms, attributed somewhat different normative statuses to people, and committed themselves to somewhat different material inferences. These are differences in practical and inferential commitment. But it now becomes clear that they were also disposed to have different noninferential moral responses to the events, persons, and actions of their time. In short, they perceived or experienced things differently. In terming these responses noninferential, I do not mean to imply that they were incorrigible, beyond the pale of rational scrutiny and revision. I simply mean that they were not arrived at initially as the result of reasoning. ([Location 4940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=4940))

- Burke cannot imagine an articulate democratic culture evolving among the working people who will soon be gathering to read Paine, let alone among the wretches he would be inclined, in some counterfactual world, to rescue from their wretchedness. For him democracy is simply a deceptive banner carried by the mob, not a civilizing practice capable of shaping individuals into articulate, reasoning beings who care about excellent things and abominate moral horrors. He suspects that it is really the pretext by means of which an urban elite of talented men seizes power for itself in the name of, and at the expense of, the people. There is truth in this suspicion, a truth forcefully restated in our day by Michel Foucault. But Burke’s conception of democracy also represents a failure of imagination. He and Paine do not only have differing moral perceptions of what is present to them (noninferentially) in their experience, they also differ in how they imagine what is not yet fully present in their experience—the possible futures that may be in the process of becoming actual. If moral perception is a capacity to respond to experiential presence, moral imagination is a capacity to respond to experiential absence, to what is not present (noninferentially) to the senses. Both of these capacities are, of course, inextricably intertwined with the emotions—in this case, with fear and sympathy—and with such virtues as discernment and hope.17 ([Location 5097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=5097))

- Two centuries after Burke and Paine, democratic discourse in the West no longer seems like a revolutionary innovation. Its defenders have an established, if deeply flawed, tradition to point to, and a modest record of social experimentation to argue over. It has its own habits of deference, challenge, ethical perception, material inference, and moral imagination—habits that have now managed to be transmitted, with some success, from generation to generation.

- In the era of a globalized economy and widely shared concerns about international terrorism, the need has never been greater for democrats to assert claims and exchange reasons with people here and there around the world who show no sign of being committed to democracy.

- Oppressed peoples have often been in a position to find democratic ideals attractive from a distance, but those ideals are first of all expressions of a democratic culture. They are meaningless when abstracted from the inferential practices and behavioral dispositions of a people in the habit of trusting one another and talking things through in a certain way. Writing democratic ideals into a constitution or a treaty without first initiating a people into the relevant social practices accomplishes little.

- The first part of this chapter defends a piecemeal, pragmatic approach as the only realistic means of building a common democratic morality. Part of the democratic project is to bring as many groups as possible into the discursive practice of holding one another responsible for commitments, deeds, and institutional arrangements—without regard to social status, wealth, or power. Because the entire practice is involved, not merely the ideals abstracted from that practice, a common morality can only be achieved piecemeal, by gradually building discursive bridges and networks of trust in particular settings.

- They appeal directly to a morality that is already, in their view, the common property of humankind. And this morality, they say, is not simply a common way of thinking and talking about moral issues (that is, a discursive practice) but a body of moral truths that need only be applied to yield concrete moral guidance on the questions currently under dispute. It is a law higher than, better than, the mores of any people. Traditional natural- law theorists take it that we all have cognitive access to this law, at least to some significant degree. If they are right, the democratic project will prove easier than it now seems. Later in the chapter I will argue that they are not.

- We notice that not everybody thinks and talks about moral topics in precisely the same way, and we would like to explain the differences philosophically. Nobody doubts that there are differences. But if the differences extend too far, we may feel compelled to become nihilists, skeptics, or radical relativists. The nihilist abandons the idea that there are moral truths. The skeptic abandons the idea that we are justified in believing whatever moral truths there may be. The radical relativist abandons the idea that we can justifiably apply moral propositions to people, deeds, and practices outside of our own culture. With these alternatives in view, good prospects for a common morality would offer consolation. If moral diversity occurs within a single framework globally shared, and the differences in how people think and talk about moral matters can be explained in terms of deeper similarities, then confidence might be restored in moral truth, in justified moral belief, and in the possibility of cross-cultural moral judgment.

- It goes without saying that two groups would share a common morality if their ways of thinking and talking about moral topics were exactly similar in all respects. But there is obviously no such pair of groups to be found. In a trivial sense, each group’s morality is unique, differing in some respect from everybody else’s. No ethical theorist denies this. When we make comparisons among moralities, we count some respects of similarity and difference as relevant and others not. Which respects count as relevant in a given context depends on which concerns motivated the comparison. By the same token, we count varying degrees of similarity in relevant respects of comparison sufficient to establish that two or more groups hold a morality in common. Again, the relevant degree of similarity depends on the concern at hand. ([Location 5195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=5195))

- The fact that all of the moralities are ways of thinking and talking is itself something they have in common, something that guarantees formal and functional similarities of various sorts. The fact that all moralities are about roughly the same kind of topic is also something they have in common, such that the substantive moral commitments of any two groups can be expected to resemble each other in some degree. Let us say that a uniformity is some respect in which all moralities resemble each other closely. Theorists differ on what the actual uniformities are, the closeness of the similarities in which they consist, and the relevance they have to various practical and explanatory concerns. They do not differ on whether there are any uniformities. ([Location 5204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=5204))
- “Moralities,” as I have been using the term, are ways of thinking and talking about a particular kind of topic. Even if I were to specify precisely what a way of thinking and talking is, the term “moralities” would still be vague, given the fuzziness of the boundaries around the topics we call moral. For the most part, the vagueness is tolerable, and for two reasons: first, because it rarely comes into play, since most cases we discuss are some distance from the fuzzy boundaries; and second, because when it does come into play, it is usually resolved by context. When we confront an alien group and its strange ways of thinking and talking, we take our initial cues from the habitual uses of the term “moral” that are embedded in our ordinary discourse at that time. If some of the topics the strangers think and talk about exhibit overall similarity to the topics we habitually call moral, we can, for most purposes, safely designate their way of thinking and talking about those topics a morality. Overall similarity is itself a vague notion, consisting as it does “of innumerable similarities and differences in innumerable respects of comparison, balanced against each… ([Location 5209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM51E&location=5209))

- Some moralities are akin to each other. Kinship is a special kind of similarity, the kind brought about by sharing a common history of development up to a certain point and then separating. Protestantism and Catholicism are members of the same ethical family. Their moralities branch off from the same stem. Their kinship helps determine the character of conflict in Belfast, both for good and for ill. It engrains many close similarities in vocabulary, attitude, and inferential commitment that could turn out to be useful in adjudication. It also means, however, that each group defines itself over against the other, thus hardening whatever differences there might be. In comparative ethics, as in folk-genealogy, a family tree is especially rigid where branches diverge from the stem.
