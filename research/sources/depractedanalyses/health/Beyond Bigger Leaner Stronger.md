### Highlights

- So, what’s the best way to quantify volume for the purposes of workout programming? Most research shows that the answer is hard sets, which are sets taken close to the point of muscular failure, regardless of the number of reps performed.

- a growing body of evidence indicates that optimal volume for muscle gain is in the range of 10 to 20 hard sets per major muscle group per week with moderately heavy weights (60 percent of one-rep max or higher) and adequate rest in between sets, with the lower number of sets being suitable for beginners and the higher end for advanced weightlifters. ([Location 2576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2576))
- research shows that you’ll gain more strength by training with heavier weights and fewer reps, ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2582))
- however, that higher-rep sets may activate certain muscle-building processes more than lower-rep sets and cause less fatigue and wear and tear on your joints. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2584))
- Ideally, then, you’d alternate systematically between doing more and fewer reps, instead of working in the same rep ranges for long periods. And that’s exactly what you’ll do in the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program. ([Location 2586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2586))

- progressive overload is the primary mechanical driver of muscle growth. ([Location 2589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2589))
- more volume are we talking about? As I mentioned earlier, the current weight of the evidence suggests that 15 to 20 hard sets per major muscle group per week is ideal for most intermediate and advanced weightlifters. ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2604))
- Your training involves progressive overload in the form of more weight, sets, or reps (with weightlifting), or faster pacing, longer distances, more complex movements, less rest, or some other method in other activities. ([Location 2625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2625))
- you can gain strength faster than muscle, ([Location 2698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2698))
- research suggests that training in different rep ranges stimulates different muscle-building mechanisms in the body. Therefore, by only training one rep range for long periods of time, you may fail to activate other “pathways” for muscle and strength gain. ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2764))
- Research shows that training a muscle group with multiple exercises may be more effective for gaining muscle and strength, likely because it better stimulates every portion of the muscle fibers. ([Location 2815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2815))
- A good rule of thumb is switching only to exercises that directly train the same muscles and swapping every eight to twelve weeks. This way, you give yourself enough time to become proficient at those exercises and make progress before replacing them. ([Location 2821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2821))
- 1. Your flexed arms should be 150 percent larger than the circumference of your non-dominant wrist (wrist circumference x 2.5). ([Location 2948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2948))
- Your flexed calves should match your flexed arms. ([Location 2960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2960))
- Your shoulder circumference should measure 1.618 times larger than your waist (waist circumference x 1.618). ([Location 2962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2962))
- 4. Your chest circumference should be 550 percent larger than the circumference of your non-dominant wrist (wrist circumference x 6.5). ([Location 2968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2968))
- 5. Your upper leg circumference should be 75 percent larger than your non-dominant knee circumference (knee circumference x 1.75). ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=2974))
- You do between 2 and 10 reps per hard set for primary exercises. You end hard sets of primary exercises 1 to 2 reps shy of technical failure, which is where your form begins to break down. You do between 6 and 12 reps per hard set for accessory exercises. You end hard sets of accessory exercises 1 rep shy of technical failure. You rest for two to four minutes between each hard set. ([Location 3649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3649))
- weekly undulating periodization involves changing your rep ranges week-to-week as opposed to day-to-day (daily undulating periodization). ([Location 3753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3753))
- You want to avoid taking sets to technical failure, because it won’t increase muscle and strength gain, often leads to bad form, and if done too often, hampers recovery as well. ([Location 3897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3897))
- In practice, this means your goal in every set of primary exercises (except AMRAP sets in Strength Weeks) is doing the prescribed number of reps without reaching technical failure. And if you feel you can exceed the target without reaching technical failure, don’t. Stop when you reach your rep target. ([Location 3899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3899))
- those scenarios. If you fall short by even one rep on a first or second set of a primary exercise, reduce your estimated one-rep max by 10 pounds, and recalculate your training weight. ([Location 3913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3913))
- When you reach the top of the prescribed rep range for all four sets of an accessory exercise, increase the weight by 10 pounds (total). Then, work with that weight until you can hit the top of the rep range for all four sets, move up again, and so on. ([Location 3926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3926))
- For your primary exercises, rest three to five minutes between each set, and for accessory exercises, two to three minutes. ([Location 3957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3957))
- During your Strength Weeks, you may want to rest longer between your AMRAP sets—five minutes or even longer, if necessary. As these sets involve lifting heavy weights for as many reps as possible, it’s worth resting an extra minute or three to increase your chances of setting a personal record. ([Location 3958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3958))
- If you haven’t performed one or more of the primary exercises in a very long time, use trial and error to find a weight you can get 4 to 5 reps with, with 2 or 3 reps in reserve. Then put your best set into the one-rep max calculator, and use the result(s) as your estimated one-rep max(es) for your first macrocycle. ([Location 3975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3975))
- For example, in the first mesocycle of a macrocycle, you’ll be working in the 10-to-12 rep range on your accessory exercises. Then, in the second mesocycle, you’ll be working in the 8-to-10 rep range. How do you determine your starting weights for that second mesocycle? Easy—just add 10 pounds to the bar, machine, or dumbbells (total, 5 per side) and you’ll lose 2 or 3 reps. ([Location 3985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=3985))
- As for warming up on an individual exercise, here’s an easy and effective routine that’ll get the job done without compromising your performance on your hard sets: Do 6 reps with about 50 percent of your hard set weight, and rest for a minute. Do 4 reps with the same weight at a faster pace, and rest for a minute. Do 2 reps with about 70 percent of your hard set weight, and rest for a minute. ([Location 4002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4002))
- Limit these types of cardio workouts to no more than 50 percent of the time you spend weightlifting. If you lift weights for five hours per week, don’t do over two and a half hours of moderate- or high-intensity cardio per week. ([Location 4055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4055))
- Do your cardio and weightlifting on separate days if possible, and if you have to do them on the same day, try to separate them by at least six hours to minimize the cardio’s “interference effect” on your weightlifting. ([Location 4058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4058))
- schedule moderate- and high-intensity cardio workouts on days with upper-body training, and low-intensity cardio workouts on lower-body days. ([Location 4061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4061))
- Another way of determining when to transition from Bigger to Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger is strength levels. If you haven’t hit at least two of the following targets, chances are you can still profit from Bigger Leaner Stronger and don’t need to switch just yet. Squat One-Rep Max: 1.5 x body weight Bench Press One-Rep Max: 1.2 x body weight Deadlift One-Rep Max: 2 x body weight Overhead Press One-Rep Max: 0.8 x body weight Chin-up or Pull-up: 8 reps with bodyweight or at least 1 rep with bodyweight plus 20 percent ([Location 4363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4363))
- Here’s a more extensive list of dumbbell and bodyweight exercises to choose from: ([Location 4551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MXE63MA&location=4551))
