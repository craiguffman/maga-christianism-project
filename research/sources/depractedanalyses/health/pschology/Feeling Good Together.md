### Highlights

- The Disarming Technique is the most powerful communication technique of all. When you use the Disarming Technique, you find genuine truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems totally unreasonable or unfair. If you do this skillfully, you’ll put the lie to the criticism, and it won’t be true any more. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0KG8&location=1342))

- Remember, when you disarm the other person, you agree that his criticism is valid. You acknowledge the truth in what he’s saying. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0KG8&location=1353))

- There’s no such thing as “codependency.” It’s just a buzzword, and it means different things to different people. ([Location 3123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0KG8&location=3123))

- I call this mind-set Submissiveness. Submissive individuals tell themselves that they must make their partners happy, even at the expense of their own needs and feelings, and even if they make themselves miserable in the process.

- Another reason is that Self-Defeating Beliefs tend to work in the short run, so we get addicted to them. For example, let’s say that you have the Submissiveness and Dependency beliefs, like Denise. You constantly cater to everyone else’s needs and feelings. For a while, this works very well because other people like the fact that you’re always doing things for them and trying to make them happy. You don’t make waves in your relationships because you fear rejection. But in the long run, you may start to notice that everyone’s using you, and nobody’s trying to meet your needs or make you happy. So you end up feeling used, burned out, or trapped, just like Denise.
