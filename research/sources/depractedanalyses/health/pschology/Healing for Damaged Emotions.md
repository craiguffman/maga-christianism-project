### Highlights

- I saw the other group moving toward phoniness. These people were repressing their inner feelings and denying that anything was seriously wrong, because “Christians can’t have such problems.” Instead of facing their problems, they covered them with a veneer of Scripture verses, theological terms, and unrealistic platitudes. ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=39))
- Somewhere between our sins, on the one hand, and our sickness, on the other, lies an area the Scripture calls “infirmities.” ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=84))

- What I am saying is that certain areas of our lives need special healing by the Holy Spirit. Because they are not subject to ordinary prayer, discipline, and willpower, they need a special kind of understanding, an unlearning of past wrong programming, and a relearning and reprogramming transformation by the renewal of our minds. And this is not done overnight by a crisis experience. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=117))

- What are some of these damaged emotions? One of the most common is a deep sense of unworthiness, a continuous feeling of anxiety, inadequacy, and inferiority, an inner nagging that says, “I’m no good. I’ll never amount to anything. No one could ever possibly love me. Everything I do is wrong.” ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=141))

- Then there’s another kind of person who has, for want of a better term, what I call the perfectionist complex. This is the inner feeling that says, “I can never quite achieve. I never do anything well enough. I can’t please myself, others, or God.” This kind of a person is always groping, striving, usually feeling guilty, driven by inner oughts and shoulds. “I ought to be able to do this. I should be able to do that. I must be a little bit better.” He’s ever climbing but never reaching. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=148))

- When Bill became a minister, all he did was exchange one mother and one father for several hundred of them: his congregation became his unappeasable parents. He could never satisfy them, no matter what he did. Finally, he just collapsed under the sheer weight of struggling for approval and trying to prove himself. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=169))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Then there is another kind of damaged emotion that we can call supersensitivity. The supersensitive person has usually been hurt deeply. He reached out for love and approval and affection, but instead he got the opposite, and he has scars deep inside of him. Sometimes he sees things other people don’t see, and he tends to feel things other people don’t ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=176))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Supersensitive people need a lot of approval. You can never quite give them enough. And sometimes they seem very insensitive. They have been hurt so badly that instead of becoming sensitive, they cover it by being hard, tough. They want to get even and hurt others. So quite unbeknown to them, they spend their lives pushing people around, hurting and dominating them. They use money or authority or position or sex or even sermons to hurt people. Does all this affect their Christian experience? Yes, very deeply. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=183))

- Then there are the people who are filled with fears. Perhaps the greatest of them all is the fear of failure. These damaged persons are so afraid of losing the game of life that they have a simple way out: never get into the game; just sit on the sidelines. They say, “I don’t like the rules” or “I don’t care for the referee.” “The ball isn’t quite round.” “The goals are not right.” ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=187))
- Life is filled with wheel kickers, people who fear failure and fear making the wrong decision. What happens to such people as they approach the Christian life? Believing is a great risk; it’s very hard. Decisions tear them up. Faith comes hard. Witnessing is difficult. Launching out in the Holy Spirit and really surrendering to God is almost a trauma. Discipline is difficult. The fearful people live on if onlys: “If only this or if only that, then I would be okay.” But since the if only never comes to pass, they usually never accomplish what they would like to. The fearful are the defeated and the indecisive. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=195))

- 2. Accept your responsibility in the matter. “But,” you say, “I was sinned against. I was a victim. You don’t know what happened to me.” True enough. But what about your response? What about the fact that you learned to hate or resent, or to escape into an unreal world? ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=233))
- Life is like a complicated tapestry, woven with a loom and shuttle. Heredity, environment, all the things experienced in childhood, from parents, teachers, playmates, all of life’s handicaps—all these things are on one side of the loom, and they pass the shuttle to you. But remember, you pass the shuttle back through the loom. And this action together with your responses weaves the design in the tapestry of your life. You are responsible for your actions. You will never receive healing for your damaged emotions until you stop blaming everyone else and accept your responsibility. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=237))

- 4. Forgive everyone who is involved in your problem. Facing responsibility and forgiving people are really two sides of the same coin. The reason some people have never been able to forgive is that if they forgave, the last rug would be pulled out from under them and they would have no one to blame. Facing responsibility and forgiving are almost the same action; in some instances you need to do them simultaneously. Jesus made it very plain that no healing occurs until there is deep forgiveness. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=248))
- You have no right to dredge up anything that God has forgiven and forgotten. He has put it behind His back. Through an inscrutable mystery, divine omniscience has somehow forgotten your sins. You can forgive yourself. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=255))

- Ask the Holy Spirit to show you what your real problem is and how you need to pray. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=257))
- The Holy Spirit knows where to tinker. We do not know what we ought to be praying for. We often do not receive because we ask for the wrong things. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=271))

- the unforgiven and unforgiving person is plagued with guilt and resentment. He lives in a prison house where he finds himself tortured by all manner of inner emotional conflicts. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=306))
- Woven into Jesus’s parable is a picture of human relationships. The world is made for forgiveness; it is made for grace; it is made for love in all of life. The need for these has been built into the structure of nature, of persons. It is in every cell of our bodies, in every interpersonal relationship. We are made for grace and love and acceptance. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=308))
- the two major causes of most emotional problems among evangelical Christians are: (1) the failure to understand, receive, and live out God’s unconditional grace and forgiveness, and (2) the failure to give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=330))
- Grace is not only God’s undeserved mercy and favor. It is also unearned and can never be repaid. The failure to see and know and feel grace drives many Christians to the tragic treadmill of performing, achieving, and striving. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=347))
- He believed and even preached grace, but he had never completely accepted God’s forgiveness. He was trying to repay by promissory note. He was doing a self-atonement job, with the guilt disposal unit going inside him. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=370))
- Anger and resentment against yourself, a refusal to forgive—these are just as damaging when directed at yourself as when they are directed against other people. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=376))
- The unforgiven are the unforgiving, and the unforgiving complete the vicious circle because they cannot be forgiven. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=379))
- The vicious circle becomes more vicious. The unaccepted are the unaccepting. The unforgiven are the unforgiving. The ungraced are the ungracious. In fact, their behavior is sometimes positively disgraceful. And emotional conflicts and broken relationships are the result. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=386))
- They owe you affection and love, security and affirmation, but since you feel indebted and guilty, resentful, insecure, and anxious, since you see yourself as unforgiven and unacceptable, you in turn become unforgiving and unaccepting. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=392))
- You’ve got to collect on the grievances, collect on your hurts. You must make all these people who have hurt you pay the debts they owe you. You are a grievance collector. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=394))
- If they work at it, men make good husbands and women make good wives. But they make lousy gods. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=397))
- 1. First of all, there’s the resentment test. Is there someone you resent, someone you’ve never let off the hook? ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=423))
- 2. The responsibility test is a little trickier. It goes something like this: “Oh, if only Mary, Joe, or Pete, my parents, my wife, my children, life, God—if only they had given me what they owed me, I wouldn’t be in this mess today. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=426))
- 3. The reminder and reaction test is really subtle. Do you find yourself reacting against a person because he reminds you of someone else? ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=433))
- Where we accept because we are accepted. Where we grace one another and are gracious because we have been graced, because we know the joy of having seen the Master tear up the charge card that we have spent beyond the limit. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=447))
- because He has set us free, we can set others free and thereby set in motion grace and love. The apostle Paul summed it in nine words: “Owe no man any thing, but to love one another” (Rom. 13:8). ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=450))
- In Jesus’s words, “Freely ye have received, freely give”; the root word for gift is used four times, so that it literally says, “Giftwise you have been given, giftwise give!” (Matt. 10:8). ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=451))

- If you put an a in front of sthenos, which means “strength,” you get the root word for infirmity, astheneia, “a want of strength, a lack of strength, a weakness, an infirmity, a crippling.” The word is hardly ever used in a purely physical sense in the New Testament. Rather, it refers to mental, moral, and emotional weaknesses, to lack of strength. Infirmities in themselves are not sins, but they do undermine our resistance to temptation. In the New Testament, infirmities are qualities in human nature that may predispose or incline us to sin, sometimes without any conscious choice on our part.

- Of all the words for the Incarnation, the greatest title is Emmanuel, “God with us.” God is in it with us. Better still, God, having gone through it Himself, knows how to be in it and feel it with us. That is why we can come boldly; we can draw near with confidence. God doesn’t say, “You can come guiltily” or “You can come shamefacedly.” You never need to think, There’s something wrong with me because I’m having this depression. I’m not spiritual. These are cruelties we Christians often inflict on one another, and they are not biblical. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=497))

- Nothing is more destructive to a human personality than a slap in the face. It is so humiliating, so demeaning, so deeply dehumanizing. It destroys something very basic to our personhood. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=530))

- Yes, He was a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. If you are grieving, He can feel it with you. For the lonely one—the widow or widower, the divorced—He understands what it is to be alone, to feel that a part of yourself has been literally torn away. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=545))

- Studies show that the two greatest stress-producing factors to body, mind, and emotions are the death of a spouse and divorce. In some ways, divorce can be worse. The death of a spouse, though painful, can be a clean wound. Divorce often leaves a dirty, infected wound, throbbing with pain. Jesus understands when a single parent is trying to be husband and wife, mother and father, all in one. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=547))

- As Christians, we often thank God that Jesus bore our sins in His body on the cross. We need to remember something else. In His full identification with our humanity, and especially on that cross, He took unto Himself the entire range of our feelings. And He bore the feeling of our infirmities, that we would not have to bear them alone. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=575))

- Because he is of the spirit world, Satan knows your weaknesses; he understands your infirmities and uses them to great advantage against you. The Bible doesn’t speak as much of the power of Satan as of his extreme subtlety, trickery, and deceptiveness. He uses clever wiles and devices, stratagems and designs. He knows how to exploit your weaknesses in the direction of discouragement, disappointment, failure, and abdication of the Christian life. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=604))
- Some of the most powerful weapons in Satan’s arsenal are psychological. Fear is one of these. Doubt is another. Anger, hostility, worry, and of course, guilt. Long-standing guilt is hard to shake off; it seems to hang on even after a Christian claims forgiveness and accepts pardoning grace. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=610))
- Satan’s greatest psychological weapon is a gut-level feeling of inferiority, inadequacy, and low self-worth. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=614))
- We wrap a lot of our fears in morbidly sanctified self-belittling. We piously cover this self-despising and call it consecration and self-crucifixion. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=672))

- What happened to your dream? Where is the vision God put before you? What wrecked it? Your sins and transgressions and bad habits? I doubt it. Probably your dream has been delayed or destroyed because Satan tricked you into thinking of yourself as a grasshopper or a worm. And as a result, you never have realized your full potential as a son or a daughter of God. You’re filled up with fears and doubts, inferiority, and inadequacy. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=675))

- Low self-esteem also spoils your relationships with other people. Satan uses your nagging sense of inferiority and inadequacy to isolate you. For the most common way to cope with feelings of inferiority is to pull within yourself, to have as little contact with other people as you possibly can, and just occasionally to peek out as the rest of the world goes by. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=688))

- You are able to give to others only when you have a proper and healthy opinion of yourself. When you devalue yourself, you become overly absorbed in and with yourself, and you don’t have anything left over to give to others. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=693))
- If you have low self-esteem, you ask another human being to do for you what no other person can do—to make you feel adequate and able—when you are already convinced that you are inadequate and unable. That’s too heavy a demand on husband or wife, on children, friends, neighbors, or church. You may become either suspicious and hostile, or cringing and clinging. God wants you to bloom with your own individual beauty, to do your part in making His garden colorful and beautiful. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=697))

- You have a whole system of feeling-concepts and concept-feelings about yourself. This is at the very core of your personality. And nowhere is the biblical statement about the heart and mind more appropriate than here: “As he thinketh in his heart, so is he” (Prov. 23:7). The way you look at yourself and feel about yourself, way down deep in the heart of your personality—so you will be and so you will become. What you see and feel will determine your relationships both with other people and with God. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=763))

- the three essential components of a healthy self-image: The first is a sense of belongingness, of being loved. This is simply the awareness of being wanted, accepted, cared for, enjoyed, and loved. I personally believe that this sense begins before birth. I’ve counseled people with such deep wounds that I am convinced their sense of rejection traces back to their parents’ attitudes before birth. If a child is unwanted, rarely will he have a sense of belonging. The second component is a sense of worth and value. This is the inner belief and feeling: “I count. I am of value. I have something to offer.” The third is a sense of being competent. It is the feeling-concept: “I can do this task; I can cope with that situation; I am able to meet life.” Put them all together, Dr. Wagner says, and you have a triad of self-concept feelings: belongingness, worthwhileness, and competence. ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=770))

- There are four sources of self-image, four factors that help a person construct self-image: the outer world, the inner world, Satan with all the forces of evil, and God and His Word. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=778))
- Now, move those mirrors over into the family. What if somehow your mother, your dad, your brother, your sister, your grandparents, the important others in your early life—what if they had taken every mirror in the house and curved them a certain way, so that in every mirror you saw a distorted reflection of yourself? What would have happened? It wouldn’t have taken you long to develop an image of yourself just like the one you were seeing in the family mirror.

- He was too sensitive to what people said about him and found himself freezing up at the slightest criticism. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=810))
- he had been neglected by his father—and that “mirror” tells a kid a lot. If a dad doesn’t have time for his child, he reflects an important message: “You’re not worth my time; I’ve got more important things to do.” I knew of the constant put-downs from his father, and the honeyed, syrupy, spiritual way his mother was always trying to help him. Her way of helping was to remind him of what was expected of him, or to compare him with a very bright and attractive older sister. I knew the destructively curved mirrors of neglect, lack of affection, criticism, and comparison in which his self-esteem had been badly distorted. Those hurts and those wounds were infecting his personality thirty years later, paralyzing his potential and sabotaging his service for God. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=814))

- there is also a spiritual factor. And it is at this point that we differ with all secular, humanistic, and pagan psychology, which looks at human nature as essentially good and morally neutral. We Christians do not do that. God has revealed to us in His Word that we do not enter this life morally neutral. Rather, we are victims of a basic tendency toward evil, a proclivity toward the wrong. We call it original sin. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=886))
- “Children are the world’s greatest recorders, but they are the world’s worst interpreters.” Kids pick up many of the imperfections around them and, because of the self-centeredness that is in all of us, they misinterpret much of what they take in, and this greatly affects their self-image. Regardless of how well parents do by their children, it seems that most people reach young adulthood feeling, “You’re okay, but I’m not okay.” It is almost a part of our human equipment.

- I have never seen anyone truly healed until, along with forgiving all those who hurt and wronged him, he also received God’s forgiveness for his own wrong responses. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=900))
- Satan is a third source, and we have already considered him as a source of our low self-esteem. Satan uses our feelings of self-despising as a terrible weapon in three roles that he plays. Satan is a liar (see John 8:44), the accuser (see Rev. 12:10), and the one who blinds our minds (see 2 Cor. 4:4). In all three roles he uses inferiority, inadequacy, and self-belittling to defeat Christians and prevent them from realizing their full potential as God’s own children. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=901))
- The truth is that self-belittling is not true Christian humility and runs counter to some very basic teachings of the Christian faith. The great commandment is that you love God with all your being. The second commandment is an extension of the first—that you love your neighbor as you love yourself. We do not have two commandments here but three: to love God, to love yourself, and to love others. I put self second, because Jesus plainly made a proper self-love the basis of a proper love for neighbor. The term self-love has a wrong connotation for some people. Whether you call it self-esteem or self-worth, it is plainly the foundation of Christian love for others. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=912))

- He was authoritatively restating the principle of the eternal triangle—proper love for God, for ourselves, and for other people. This basic law of God is written into the nature of the entire universe. It operates in every cell of your body. The person who has proper self-esteem is healthier in every way than the person with low self-esteem. This is the way God has made you, and if you go against this, you are not only following wrong theology but bargaining with your own destruction. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=926))
- For the person with low self-esteem is always trying to prove himself. He has a need to be right in every situation, to verify himself. He gets all wrapped up in constantly looking at himself. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=941))

- person with low self-esteem becomes extremely self-centered. This doesn’t necessarily mean he is selfish. He may be a doormat, and this is part of his problem. But he is self-centered in that he is always looking at himself and wondering about himself. He may even become a praiseaholic, constantly maneuvering others into reassuring him. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=942))
- You cannot really unconditionally love others when you need to prove your own self-worth. It may look as if you are loving them, when actually you are just using them to reassure yourself that you’re okay. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=945))

- Perfectionism is a counterfeit for Christian perfection, holiness, sanctification, or the Spirit-filled life. Instead of making us holy persons and integrated personalities—that is, whole persons in Christ—perfectionism leaves us spiritual Pharisees and emotional neurotics.

- 4. Legalism. The oversensitive conscience and comprehensive guilt of the perfectionist are usually accompanied by a great scrupulosity and legalism that rigidly overemphasize externals, dos and don’ts, rules and regulations.

His yoke is comfortable because it is tailor-made to your personality, your individuality, and your humanity. “My burden is light” means that the Christ who fits you with a yoke will never leave you alone but will always be yoked with you in the form of the Paraclete, the One who comes alongside to help you carry that comfortable burden and yoke.

- HEALING IS A PROCESS The first step is to abandon all ideas of a quick cure. Don’t let anyone delude you with the idea that a crisis cure will instantaneously heal you. In fact, part of the disease itself is to be always looking for a solution just around the corner. For perfectionism specializes in “if onlys”: “If only I could __________________, I would be okay.” ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1188))

- This youngster doesn’t sit down and figure this all out. He doesn’t know what is happening in his life—that he is not receiving fulfillment of deep, God-given needs that are basic to the development of a human being. Some very necessary feelings never come across to him, feelings such as security, acceptance, belonging, and value. His needs to be loved and to learn to give love are not met. Instead, there develops a growing deep anxiety and feelings of insecurity, unworthiness, and undesirableness. And the youngster begins to climb the long, torturous trail of trying to become someone else. ([Location 1357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1357))

- Unfortunately, when this person becomes a Christian, this self-destructive process is not automatically stopped. Forgiveness, loving acceptance, and God’s grace penetrate some outer layers of his unreal self, bringing a new spirit of honesty to his life. But if the distortion is serious and the emotions are badly damaged, a deeper kind of healing is needed. For all too often, the pseudoself transfers over into the Christian life itself and reorganizes around the new religious experience.

Paul was saying, “Express your anger, but be sure that it doesn’t lead you into any form of bitterness, resentment, or hatred.” Now the strange fact of the matter is that unless you and I learn proper ways of expressing and resolving anger, we will become resentful and bitter.

- 2. Anger. The most concise definition of depression I know is this: “Depression is frozen rage.” If you have a consistently serious problem with depression, you have not resolved some area of anger in your life. As surely as the night follows the day, depression follows unresolved, repressed, or improperly expressed anger. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1670))
- who didn’t have a terrific sense of injustice and unfairness. The only answer to this deep anger against the injustices of life is forgiveness. Who most often needs to be forgiven? Parents and family members. So often, the roots of depression are buried in the subsoil of early family life. And unless you learn to deal honestly with those angry roots, to face your resentment and forgive, you’ll be living in a greenhouse where depression is sure to flourish. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1679))

- You may need to forgive your marriage partner for past mistakes. But to forgive is also a present extension of grace to the person himself. Forgive your partner for just being the way he or she is—unable to meet some of your needs. Some of the most serious marital depressions arise when a husband or a wife thinks, But, God, I have a right to feel this way! I ought to feel this way because she/he … And when we say we have a right to feel cheated and resentful and betrayed, we are on the road to depression! ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1707))
- He does invite you to join Him in His work of forgiving and loving. “Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,” as God would say it—“even as [I] for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you” (Eph. 4:32). Get out of the setting-right-and-getting-even business and into the forgiving-and-loving business. ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1717))
- When you surrender your anger and oversensitivity to injustice and unfairness, you won’t have trouble with self-pity, and your depressions will lessen immediately. ([Location 1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1720))
- 1. Avoid being alone. When you are depressed, you don’t want to be around people. You want to withdraw. But withdrawing means isolation, and isolation during depression means alienation. Force yourself to be with people. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1725))
- 2. Seek help from others. During depression your perceptions change. A little hill becomes a great mountain. But real friends can help you see its true height in perspective. You can no more pull yourself out of depression than you can get yourself out of quicksand by pulling at your own hair. Seek out people and situations that generate joy.

- 4. Praise and give thanks. All the saints of the centuries agree on this one. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1732))
- 5. Lean heavily on the power of God’s Word. God can use any portion of the Scriptures to minister to you during times of depression, but throughout the centuries His people have found the Psalms to be the most beneficial. ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1736))
- Out of the 150 psalms, there are 48 that can speak to your condition. Here is a list I often give out: 6, 13, 18, 23, 25, 27, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 51, 55, 57, 62, 63, 69, 71, 73, 77, 84, 86, 90, 91, 94, 95, 103, 104, 107, 110, 116, 118, 121, 123, 124, 130, 138, 139, 141, 142, 143, 146, and 147. The most profitable procedure is to read them out loud. This allows the psalmist to become your contemporary, expressing both his and your feelings of abandonment, despair, and melancholy, and his (and I trust, your) affirmation of faith and hope in God. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1738))
- 6. Rest confidently in the presence of God’s Spirit. The psalmist repeatedly affirmed the secret of deliverance from depression. He encouraged himself, “Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance” (Ps. 42:5). It is the assurance of God’s “countenance”—His face—that is the guarantee of His personal presence. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1742))
- The important words in that protest are “this world,” and they are precisely Paul’s point. We suffer because it is this world, not some dream world that we would like to have, some utopia that we may fantasize about and wish to live in. We live in this world—after the fall, this side of Eden, this paradise-lost world where sin entered by the choices of God’s children. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1784))
- Imagine that particular time when one cell of life from your father broke into the living cell of your mother, and you came into existence. That’s when you broke into human history. As you think about that, ask yourself one question: Where was God at that moment?” ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SSL1WL4&location=1889))
