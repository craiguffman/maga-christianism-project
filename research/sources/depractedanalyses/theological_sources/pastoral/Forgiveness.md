### Highlights

- It was how we treated the person at the cash register or the way we snapped at our spouse. Sometimes sins are more serious. They’re the intentionally hurtful things we say and do over and over again. We carry around these sins, big and small, and as long as we don’t confess and repent of them, they remain in our souls.

- I sought to illustrate this idea to my congregation the last time I preached on forgiveness. I had a table on the chancel, covered in rocks of all shapes and sizes. Some rocks were small, just pebbles; others could be weighed in pounds. I had a backpack that represented the way we carry our sin and guilt with us. I took two handfuls of pebbles and named them things like Harsh Words, An Irritating Glance, Speeding, Little White Lies. When you tossed them into the backpack, you hardly felt it. But after adding handfuls of pebbles over time, the backpack became quite heavy. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=155))

- Then there were the big rocks, each stone the size of a bread loaf, some as heavy as twenty pounds. They represented very serious sins—the kind that, at work, for example, would merit our dismissal if discovered. Some might be criminal acts. Some represented such fundamental violations of trust that, if found out, would lead to divorce or a loss of friendships. I put a few of those in my backpack. I took my backpack, now filled with nearly sixty pounds of rocks, hoisted it onto my back, and continued to preach and move around the chancel of the church. But quickly, I began to become winded. My shoulders drooped. One of my arms tingled, and my lower back hurt. The congregation winced as they watched, seeing the metaphorical effects of sin and guilt on our souls played out on my body as I sought to carry that pack while preaching. Like the psalmist, I could feel it: “My guilt has overwhelmed me, like a burden too heavy for me to carry.” ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=163))

- Those who don’t seek forgiveness carry a host of burdens. Every harsh word, every unclean thought, every instance in which we neglect to do the right thing or go ahead and do the wrong thing—they’re all there. Without forgiveness, they create an ever-widening gap between us and God, and between us and our fellow human beings. They sap our joy and then our strength.

- a Christianity obsessed with guilt is no Christianity. Christianity is a faith whose central focus is not guilt, but grace, redemption, healing, forgiveness, and mercy. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=183))

- But the process of forgiveness begins with our awareness and understanding of sin, for if we are not aware of our sin, we go on living self-absorbed lives while hurting others. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=185))

- the healing can’t start until patients are willing to admit they are sick. Once patients admit this, there is the important task of the diagnosis, which then makes possible the cure. So it is with Christianity. We speak about sin in an attempt to diagnose the spiritual malady that afflicts us all. My goal, then, is not to accuse you of being, or even to tell you that, you are sick, but to offer you the medicine that makes you well. It’s not simply to ask you the question, but to lead you to the answer. Yes, we’re all sinners, and yes, this is a serious issue, but God is a God of grace and mercy.

- Once, while Jesus was teaching, the religious leaders brought to him a woman caught in the act of adultery. The leaders were carrying stones, since the penalty for adultery, according to the Law of Moses, was death by stoning. They brought the woman to Jesus, hoping to trap him because they knew he showed grace to sinners. They asked him, “Jesus, what shall we do with this woman?” To which he replied, “The one of you who is without sin, you cast the first stone.” One by one, the religious leaders walked away. Then Jesus turned to the woman. She was ashamed and filled with guilt, but he looked at her and said, “Woman, where are your accusers? Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more” (John 8:10-11).

- Over the years, I’ve learned that LaVon is bothered by clutter, so I try to clean up in order to bless her. For her part, LaVon has learned to accept the fact that I will never be as neat as she is, and she has agreed to buy the “good stuff” when shopping for jam.

- too often in our intimate relationships we stop recording credits and go right on recording debits.

In the darkness, I set my hands on the bed, palms uplifted, and pray. I thank God for the day. I praise him for all the blessings in my life.

- There are two possible responses to these bigger hurts: we can seek justice or offer mercy. If your partner never hears you ask for mercy and doesn’t ever feel mercy from you, then he or she is going to seek justice, which, in this case, looks like getting even. He or she may adopt the attitude of, “You’ve hurt me so many times, I’m going to hurt you. I know what your needs are, but why would I meet them when you won’t meet mine? I know this will hurt you, but after the way you’ve hurt me, you deserve it.” In this way, one by one, we put stones in each other’s backpack.

- It begins with awareness, our consciousness of the fact that something we’ve done has brought pain to our partner. In acknowledging that fact, and in doing our best to understand what our partner must feel like, we experience true regret, or remorse. This, too, requires time and effort. When LaVon makes me aware of something I’ve done wrong, I am much more likely to be defensive than remorseful. I have to think about it for a while. I have to search my heart. When I do, I find myself thinking, “I married you with a promise to love and bless you, not hurt… ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=451))

- Once we are aware of the stone we’ve placed in the other’s backpack, and we’ve begun to understand the impact it has had, we’re ready for confession, which sounds something like this: “I think I finally understand how you were affected by what I did, and I’m very sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you, but I realize that I did. Would you please forgive me?” Don’t use the opportunity to point out your partner’s faults; that’s not confession. Neither is a quick, mumbled “Sorry.” Either of these approaches simply puts more stones in your partner’s backpack. This is about acknowledging the wrong you’ve done and earnestly asking for grace.

- In the Greek New Testament, the word for repentance is metanoia (and several other related words). It means “to change one’s mind and one’s heart, leading to a change in behavior.” If sin is stepping off the path God intends, repentance is returning to the right path. True repentance is not simply feeling bad about what you did and asking for forgiveness, although those steps are essential as well. You’ve also got to commit to change.

- Of course, once repentance is extended, the question then becomes whether the other party will forgive. Sometimes we don’t feel like forgiving, but we decide to do so anyway, knowing that at some point we are going to need forgiveness ourselves. Part of forgiveness is sheer willpower, a hard-won decision to go through with the process. One woman wrote to me and said, “I find that husbands are a lot like kids. It’s when you want to love them or forgive them the least that you need to do it the most. I find that when I make up my mind to stop being bitter or annoyed at my husband that our love is the best.

- When your partner has done everything or, more realistically, almost everything possible to take the pain away, to lift the rocks from your backpack, then it’s up to you. Sometimes we decide that we like to collect these old rocks. We hear our partner earnestly seek our forgiveness, but we decide to hold on to the rock. We decide that we like it in our backpack. At that point, the offended becomes the offender. You become responsible for the wall between you. That’s no better or fairer than creating it in the first place. Both repentance and forgiveness take effort. Yet both are works and expressions of love. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=487))

- Examples that come to mind include serious and persistent deceit; physical, psychological, or verbal abuse; addictions; and infidelity. These are each like forty-pound boulders. It’s not possible to carry a stone like that for long. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=494))

- There are exceptions, however. For example, there are those who suggest that God requires the wronged party to stay in an abusive or deceit-filled marriage. I don’t believe this. Marriage was not meant to be a life sentence or a time of torture; neither were our homes meant to be places of fear. A marriage filled with persistent deceit, addictions, or abuse has ceased to be a marriage as God intends. Marriages can survive these serious sins, provided there is real and substantial change, but even then, they cannot do so without grace. I’ve known many who overcame these sins and whose marriages were healed. But I’ve also known many whose marriages were unable to survive, largely because the abuser, deceiver, or addict was unable to set aside the boulder, continuing to place it back in the partner’s arms by reverting to the sinful behavior.

- A more common form of serious sin in marriage and committed relationships is infidelity. In an anonymous survey of the congregation I serve, 8.1 percent of married people had been unfaithful at some point in their lives. The number was lower for couples in their twenties and thirties, and went up the longer a couple was married. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=506))

- It is the role of the offender to do everything possible to bear the burden with the wounded mate. If you feel the weight of that burden, if you acknowledge and confess it honestly and openly, and if you are committed never to violate the covenant again, then your relationship may have a fighting chance. Until your partner can set aside the boulder they carry from the affair, your task is to help them carry it. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=538))

- You will struggle, wondering when they will finally forgive. They will eventually be ready for you to help them set aside the boulder. But this is not something people get over in a week or a month. You will increase the likelihood of success with counseling, and with a sincere turn toward God. Trying to heal a breach like this without turning to God for support and in repentance will be infinitely more difficult. You’ll need to help your partner carry that stone until you’ve taken it away, until you are carrying it. When your partner is finally able to let it go, it’s not that he or she has forgotten it, but has chosen no longer to think about it.

- 92 percent of marriages will not face the issue of adultery. Most will not face abusive situations or addiction, though these are possibilities in all of our lives. All couples, however, will need to decide what to do with the thousands of pebbles tossed their way each year by their mates. Generally we bear with each other, and, as we learn what irritates our mates, we seek, in compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, to refrain from doing these things. And as we mature in our love, we learn to change our accounting systems, keeping track of the credits while setting aside the debits.

- When the other has wronged us, we choose to forgive not just seven times, but seventy times seven times. And once we forgive, we don’t go dredging up past sins. When the wrongs are of the most serious kind—the forty-pound boulders—time will be needed for healing and regaining trust. These wrongs likely will require the help of a counselor.

- Peter asked a similar question in the Scripture passage at the beginning of this chapter. He asked, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? Seven times?” Note here that when Peter referred to “the church,” it consisted primarily of his brother Andrew, his friends James and John, and a handful of others. Peter was asking, in essence, “Lord, if Andrew or James wrongs me, how often do I need to forgive them? Is seven times enough, Lord? I’m on six and I’m hoping seven is all that I owe them.” Jesus surprised Peter by answering, “No, not seven times, but seventy times seven times,” an idiomatic phrase that meant, in essence, an infinite number of times.

- I’m guessing that if each of us held on to every little irritant, slight, and perceived wrong, within a few days, we could easily wind up with more gravel than a person can carry. Often, others aren’t even aware that we feel they have wronged us. They don’t know to ask forgiveness. So, somewhere along the way we’ve got to find the capacity to let go. But how do we do that? For these little slights, I suggest three steps captured by the acronym RAP. The first step is to remember your own shortcomings, the little sins you regularly commit. When you feel that somebody has offended you, stop and consider how many times you’ve done something like it. When someone cuts me off in traffic and I feel a twinge of irritation, I remember the times I’ve done it myself, and my frustration disappears. It’s difficult to stay mad at somebody else when you’re conscious of your own flaws. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=636))

- When I remembered my own recent failure at kindness, compassion, and patience, I found I was much more gracious toward our flight attendant, which led me to the second step in letting go of the little things: assume the best of the person who has slighted you.

- I began imagining what may have caused the flight attendant to be so impatient and grumpy. I wondered if she had a child sick at home, or if she wasn’t feeling well. I imagined she might be working overtime and was just very tired. That led me to the third step in letting go of the little things. I did what Jesus told us to do for those who may not treat us well. He told us to pray for them and to love them. The Apostle Paul, quoting the Proverbs, told us not to return evil for evil, but to return blessing instead. I began to pray for my flight attendant: “Lord, you know what her circumstances are. She seems particularly stressed, tired, or at the end of her rope. Please bless her, and use me to bless her.” As I began to pray for the flight attendant, an interesting thing happened. In my heart, I felt compassion for her and wanted to bless her. When she finally came to my seat and asked what I wanted to drink, I felt prompted to tell her, “I want you to know how grateful I am for you and for the way you serve us. Your job really matters, and you make our flight easier.” She paused, taken aback, and then she smiled and said, “It’s been a hectic day, and it seems I’ve had one complaint after another. You’re the first person to thank me in a long time. I really appreciate that.” For the rest of the flight, she was a different person. All she had needed was one person to show kindness, and she was able to let go of the frustration and stress she’d been feeling all day. Before I got off the plane, she thanked me again for my encouraging words. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=650))

- Once you begin practicing the RAP method a lot, it can almost become a game—assuming the best of those who throw pebbles at you and finding ways to return blessings. In the process, you can avoid being caught up in anger or irritation, and, every once in a while, the blessings you return might just have a remarkable impact on the pebble thrower. Just RAP: remember your own shortcomings, assume the best of people, and pray for them. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=662))

- Is forgiving the same thing as condoning? No, forgiveness is not the same as condoning. Forgiveness means letting go of the right to retribution. We are letting go of the pain in our own lives and putting down the stones we have carried in our hearts. Yet we are also putting down the stones we might have thrown at those who wronged us. Having said that, we can, and usually must, choose to let go of these stones, while still being clear that what happened was not okay. We are choosing not to allow these wrongs to continue to affect us. We are choosing not to give the wrongdoer any more power over us.

- Does forgiving dismiss the consequences? Often forgiveness means setting aside the right to retribution, but sometimes there are consequences that cannot be avoided. If someone lies to you or betrays a confidence, you may forgive that person, but it may be a long time before you trust the person again. This loss of trust is a consequence people face by virtue of their dishonesty or betrayal, even though you may have forgiven them. When my children were small and they did something that required punishment, we would put them in time-out. As they got a little older, we would ground them. At some point during the punishment, one of my daughters, Danielle or Rebecca, might say, “Dad, I’m really sorry. I know I did the wrong thing. I shouldn’t have done that.” And I’d say to her, “Thank you for saying that. I love you so much. I understand, and it’s all right now.” “Am I still grounded?” “Yes, honey, I’m sorry. You’re still grounded.” ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=679))

- Her being grounded was not retribution; it was a way of teaching her and forming her character so that she would avoid repeating the transgression in the future.

- If the aim of a punishment is only retribution, then this punishment must be set aside once forgiveness enters the picture. But if the aim of a punishment is redemption, then that punishment may be essential, even after forgiveness happens. God works through consequences and punishment.

- Do we forgive someone who has done something serious and who hasn’t repented or asked for forgiveness? Once again, the answer can be both yes and no. If we’re talking about pebbles, we must routinely forgive even when the other doesn’t repent. Sometimes people don’t understand that they’ve done wrong. Sometimes they are not even aware of what happened. Some pebbles can become more serious, and we must confront the one who has wronged us, even though the issue is minor, to keep it from becoming bigger. Typically, though, we let go of the pebbles and offer forgiveness without waiting for repentance on the part of the person who wronged us. We do this as much for ourselves as for the offender, and, in the process, become grateful that others routinely forgive us. But what about larger stones? Do we forgive these more serious wrongs when the other has not displayed an awareness of the wrong, expressed regret, asked for forgiveness, or expressed a willingness to change? Here, it is important to remember that there are two dimensions to forgiveness: there is your internal release of bitterness, anger, or desire for revenge, and there is the extension of mercy toward the one who has wronged you.

- In the second dimension of forgiveness—extending mercy to those who have wronged us—we may actually harm wrongdoers if we extend mercy too quickly. Wrestling with the hurt they have caused is a part of their redemptive process, and for Christians, redemption should always be the goal.

- Yes, Jesus tells us to forgive, but at that point, Michael wasn’t asking for anybody’s forgiveness. Offering him mercy did not help. Of course, those students would eventually need to let go of the hate and bitterness in their hearts, but extending mercy so quickly to one who had not asked for it, who had not repented, who had done something so terrible was surely not what Jesus had in mind. In fact, their actions could well have stopped the redemption process. Michael needed to come to terms with the terrible weight of what he had done. He needed to feel the horror of it, to confess and be changed because of it. Once that happened, it might have been appropriate to show mercy to him, although even mercy would not have waived the consequences of such an act. Offering mercy before a person understands the need for it can diminish the gravity of the act. It gets in the way of the true goal of forgiveness, which is the redemption of the other person.

- I am reminded of a domestic violence workshop I attended. Often, after the first time an abuser beats his spouse (in most cases domestic violence is committed by men, though not always), the abuser feels terrible remorse. He is apologetic and swears it will never happen again. He seems to have repented. The spouse takes him back, often, if the abused is a Christan, believing that this is what Christians are supposed to do. Then, in many cases, a week or a month later, he abuses again. He feels bad again, and she may show mercy once more. But mercy doesn’t bring change. Instead, the victim has become an inadvertent enabler of abuse. The cycle of violence, remorse, and mercy develops a rhythm, and suddenly it’s a pattern. That’s what can happen if mercy is extended when it should not have been. The New Testament calls people to repentance so they may receive forgiveness. Let’s look again at the four basic components of repentance: awareness of the wrong done, regret for the pain and harm caused, confession and a request for forgiveness and restoration, and change, or a real effort to avoid committing the wrong again.

- While it is generally true that we don’t extend the gift of mercy before earnest repentance happens, there are exceptions to this rule. There are times when extending mercy before repentance actually leads to shame and guilt on the part of the one who has wronged us, and moves them toward genuine repentance. The greatest example of this is Jesus and his death on the cross. From the cross, he prays, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” Such a magnificent act of mercy would haunt those who… ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=732))

- In Matthew 18, Jesus assumed there would be times of conflict in the community he was forming, which was the church. He knew his followers would sin against one another. So he gave advice for how Christians should seek reconciliation. He had already spoken of this in Matthew 5:23-24, as part of the Sermon on the Mount: “So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.” Keep in mind that Jesus was speaking in Galilee, and the altar was in Jerusalem at the temple. He was saying, “After you’ve made your way to Jerusalem, which is a ten-day journey, if you realize that you’ve neglected to seek the forgiveness of someone you have wronged back home, before offering your sacrifice to God, travel back and make amends, then travel ten days once again to offer your sacrifice to God.” This… ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=740))

- In Matthew 18, Jesus went on to tell his disciples that if someone else wronged them and the other person did not come forward to make amends, it was the disciples’ responsibility to initiate reconciliation: If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. (Matthew 18:15-17) Remember that when Jesus spoke of the church, he was referring to a rather small group. He was saying, “Peter, when John says or does something that wounds you, if he doesn’t see it or acknowledge it, go and speak to him in private and tell him.” Jesus’ admonition had two parts: we are to initiate reconciliation, not waiting for the other; and we are not to tell all our friends about the wound inflicted upon us by another, but instead are to speak with them alone.

- How different this is from the way many Christians address being wronged in their lives today. Too often, if others don’t notice the wrong they’ve committed, or don’t believe they’ve done anything wrong, we don’t have the nerve to sit down and talk with them. Instead, we tell our entire group about the other’s sin. Perhaps we share it on social media. When we do this, we make reconciliation even harder, but more than that, we now have sinned against the other, and often our sin is worse than the sin committed against us to begin with!

- Jesus went on to offer a second and third suggestion about what to do if the one who has sinned against you fails to acknowledge it. (We can assume these are not small slights or pebbles that we can routinely let go.) Jesus said that if the other doesn’t hear or acknowledge what we’re saying, then we return to speak to this person with two trusted friends whose job is to listen, bear witness to the supposed wrong, and help bring about reconciliation, which is the goal of the entire process. Finally, if the person does not accept the witness of these friends and instead persists in sin, then the church (at that time a group of perhaps twelve to twenty) appeals to the individual… ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=770))

- This entire process described by Jesus is sometimes referred to as church discipline. The last proscription, to treat the offender as a Gentile or tax collector, is interesting. In some churches, this command has been interpreted as excommunication. But it is helpful to remember that Jesus spent much of his time with Gentiles and tax collectors. He loved them, enjoyed fellowship with them, healed their sick, and invited them to be his followers. Seen in this light, it appears that Jesus was instructing the church to treat the offender as they would treat anyone else who needed his grace and love. The other may have broken fellowship because of… ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008R3YOWC&location=776))

- Each of us has hurt somebody else. Somebody is carrying rocks with our names on them in their backpack. If you can think of a person like that, why not acknowledge your wrong-doing and express your remorse? Why not ask forgiveness? Pray for the strength and courage to do that, and to have the right words to express your sorrow. Even if the other doesn’t forgive you, it will help you both. And if there is someone whose stones you’ve been carrying around, someone toward whom you feel bitterness and the desire for retaliation, perhaps now is the time to let go, or at least to try placing that person in the hands of God, allowing God to be responsible for justice. It’s time for you to trust and to let it go. Pray for God to bless and heal the other and to give you the strength to forgive. We all need healing and reconciliation in our lives. It takes willingness and work, but the rewards are huge. And on the other side of the process is freedom, for you and for others, as well as joy in walking the path God has laid before us.
