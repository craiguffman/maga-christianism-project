### Highlights

- Why should describing the relations between God and humanity as a `story' implicate one in equating God with a story? It does so because the driving force of narrative theology, the method itself, slides into the place of content or subject matter. That is the thesis of this book, and this introductory chapter gives the argument in nuce. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=49))
- For Lindbeck, it's not so much the substantial content which the colourful types convey that matters, but rather typology as a method of reading the Bible. `In the early days,' he says, `it was not a different canon but a distinctive method of reading which differentiated the church from the synagogue. ...a certain way of reading Scripture (viz. as a Christ-centered narrationally and typologically unified whole in conformity to a Trinitarian rule of faith) was constitutive of the Christian canon and has ... an authority inseparable from that of the Bible itsel£'3 Biblical types or images can be imagined as a set of icons or pictures possessing a redoubtable reality quotient, but they can also be conceived as picturings. For narrative theology, Scripture is, not a picture, but a picturing, the rule-governed process by which reality is construed.

- The presence of Christ to us in narrative theology is like that of a screen actor to a movie-viewer. The screened `self' is both product of a collective imagination and delivered to one. This analogy undermines personality, or so I shall argue in the second chapter. In Chapter 3, on arguments for the existence of God, I try to show that the manner in which narrative theologies invite us to intuit the existence of God is like the way a director edits out whatever distracts our attention from the film's driving questions. Suchdefective arguments exacerbate the problem of evil: our fourth chapter will tease out the way in which this produces a melodramatic perspective on the relation between God and vulnerable humanity.

- In the expressions `story Barthianism' and `grammatical Thomism, `Barthianism' and `Thomism' refer to principles which narrative theologians have considered these writers to yield, not to historical figures or texts. Our typology relates to certain types of Barthianism and Thomism, not Barth and Thomas. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=116))

- Nicholas Lash remarks that, `critical scrutiny of the tales that we inhabit, while drawing its criteria from the narratives themselves, first focuses on the ethos, way of life, or project which is shaped and generated by the tale'.20 Many Thomists of the last generation would agree: the primary manifestation of Christian theology is the Christian way of life-Christians doing the story. Christians don't originally believe a set of propositions, they inhabit a peculiarly biblical narrative world. For the grammatical Thomist, `all human action is speech, including the speech-acts themselves'.2' Pure-blooded historical readers of Thomas Aquinas can debate whether these opinions can be found in the Summa Theologiae or whether Ludwig Wittgenstein… ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=122))
- The `family resemblance' amongst members of the Yale School of post-liberal theology, such as Hans Frei (1922-88), George Lindbeck, and David Kelsey, comes back to their shared interest in Karl Barth. Lindbeck christened their project as `post-liberal' in order to call attention to their mutual rejection of the efforts of liberal theologians to find common ground with extra-Christian rationality. For post-liberalism, `the biblical narratives provide the framework within which Christians understand the world' without `assuming someuniversally acceptable standard of rationality' 22 Such a means of parting the ways with theologians like Friedrich Schleiermacher and Rudolf Bultmann has its roots in Barth's own disavowal of liberalism. Historical scholars may point to differences between the work of the Yale… ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=127))
- To affirm withLindbeck that `Intratextual theology redescribes reality within the Scriptural framework rather than translating Scripture into extrascriptural categories'24 is to deny, with Barth, that one could have one foot on the `common ground' of natural… ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=144))
- Richard Bauckham remarks that `Greek philosophy... typically defined divine nature by means of a series of metaphysical attributes.'27 Catholic neo-scholasticism, Protestant orthodoxy, and liberal Protestantism used the tools of philosophical theology in speaking about God and about the Trinity. For example, they drew on notions such as simplicity or transcendence or immateriality-they used metaphysics, and somehow brought this metaphysic to bear on the Christian God. This can make it look as if the biblical characterizations are larded in as an after-thought. A well-known neo-Thomist was heard to remark that he had finished his book on God and now he needed only to put in some scriptural quotations. That is what Barth suspected the moderns, Protestant and Catholic, were up to, and this is why he decided to develop a doctrine of God extrapolated from… ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=154))
- It is important to this method that the scriptural revelation is not something other than God but an elementary articulation of God's being. Barth observes that, `If we really want to understand revelation in terms of its subject, i.e., God, then the first thing we have to realise is that this subject, God, the revealer, is identical with His act in revelation and also identical with its effect.'29 One consequence of this is that one cannot speak of God metaphysically. What we must aim at, instead, is description. The methodological principle at work here is that, on the one hand… ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=160))
- For some, the ejection of the concealed decretum absolutum is at the heart of Barth's theology of revelation. As Barth would have it, turning the Calvinist theology inside-out, Christ, the revelation and exposition of God to humanity, is the decretum absolutum. Jesus Christ is `the type of all election'3 -that is, he is predestination. There is no God back behind this revelation of God in Christ, no done-deals or secret decrees. It is in and through Christ, eternally elected by the Father, that `God moves toward the world'. `In the strict sense,' therefore, `only He can be understood and described as "elected" (and "rejected"). All others are so in him, and not as individuals.' But, if we `would know who God is, and what is the meaning and purpose of His Election ... we must look only upon and to the name of Jesus Christ' in whom all others are `enclosed': He is `God's decree' `all-inclusively'. The Father's election of Christ is a free choice of love, involving his entire being:this means that `the choice actually made must be regarded as a decretum absolutum'. There is no God back behind the revealed God, `no… ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=171))
- One motive for making Jesus Christ the sole and entire revelation of God is to rule out a `God behind God' and thus to exclude the idea that God is `merely a tyrant living by his whims'.34 The answer to the theodicial dilemma… ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=181))
- Narrative theologians object to the practice of trying to ground the truth of theology in a `world' outside itself, in, for instance, some historical or scientific case. When the historical truth of Scripture was defended by biblical inerrantists against historical criticism, says Lindbeck, `the narrative meaning collapsed into the factual and disappeared'.35 It is easy to get tangled up in spatial metaphors like `biblical world' or `common ground, and forget that there are not actually two separate worlds or territories, that of scientists or historians, and that belonging to the Bible. Nor do Barthians think there are. The `worlds' to which they refer are mental paradigms or methods of construing and categorizing evidence, as, for instance, those pertaining to history and to theology. Their… ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=186))
- Building on the features of Maritain's `critical realism' which are developed systematically within Lonergan's transcendental Thomism, and thinning the element of contentual realism further, the next generation, the grammatical Thomists, affirmed that Thomas' discussion of how to name God isa `meta-linguistic'48 exercise, concerned not with naming God but with naming God. Before he began to meditate The Nature of Doctrine in the late 1970s, Lindbeck had undergone `ten years of teaching medieval thought at Yale (mostly in the philosophy department)'. He remarks that this book's `grammatical or regulative understanding of doctrine has patristic roots retrieved with the help of' the transcendental Thomist, and `Canadian Jesuit, Bernard Lonergan'.49 An observation concerning Lindbeck's idea of doctrines applies equally well to a grammatical Thomist's idea of the meaning of propositions about God: if `they are in some sense assertive, their referents are words, like sentences in a grammar book describing grammatical forms.s° Although story Barthianism may owe more of its method to Barth than grammatical Thomism does to Thomas, neither would have been possible without transcendental Thomism.

- Thomists could have learned to live with history by developing the thesis that the most creative moments of Western philosophy have been those in which, aligning itself with Christian revelation, it has drawn on God's historical, revelatory acts-but, aside from existential Thomists like Frederick Wilhelmsen, they largely chose not to take Gilson's suggestion seriously. An allergy to history is the main legacy of Thomism to narrative theologies-including that of Robert Jenson. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=271))
- As Lindbeck understands it, verbal meaning is more immediately linked to use than to correspondence. He argues that, `the proper way to determine what "God" signifies ... is by examining how the word operates within a religion and thereby shapes reality and experience rather than by first establishing its propositional or experiential meaning and reinterpreting or reformulating its uses accordingly'.55 Thus the contents of the Christian doctrines, such as the material set out in the Nicene Creed, are not primarily realities taken to `correspond' to the words of the Creed, but rules to be followed. For the narrativist, the Creed does not primarily define what or who God is, but gives Christians rules to follow in how to synthesize and practise the Christian faith. Lindbeck defines narrative theology as a `rule theory' which bases Christian doctrine neither in experience nor in the reference of its propositions to God:54 Lindbeck, The Church in a Postliberal Age, p. 205.55 Lindbeck, The Nature of Doctrine, p. 114.[Rule theory] ... does not locate the abiding and doctrinally significant aspect of religion in propositionally formulated truths, much less in inner experiences, but in the story it tells and in the grammar that informs the way the story is told and used. ... a religion ... is ... a categorial framework within which one has certain kinds ofexperiences and makes certain kinds of affirmations. In the case of Christianity, the framework is supplied by the biblical narratives… ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=277))
- Many narrative theologians would argue that the use of the metaphor of `story' in their theology does not automatically imply that God is a story. They would say that the metaphor of `story' relates to the methodology, the means of approaching the subject of theology, not the content itself-God. They believe that it's only a few over-the-top theologians like Robert Jenson who take the method so literally as to identify God with a story. However, we are apt to use language to speak about things, to make `first-order' affirmations. Even when we speak of the weather, we want to affirm something real, and our use of language has a metaphysical or substantive trajectory, although what we say is nothing very metaphysical, or substantive. The metaphysical impulseof language fulfils its natural desire to touch reality in the supernatural revelation of reality to us by Scripture. When this primary ordering is inverted into `talk about talk; the `first-order' or referential use of language does not… ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=296))
- If Jenson's thought proves on close inspection to be more redolent of Hegel than of Thomas Aquinas or Karl Barth, then why call it `story Thomism'? The reason is that Jenson's own thought does not emerge from systematic use of German Romantic philosophical theology, but from a synthesis of the principles at work in grammatical Thomism and story Barthianism. An introductory sketch of his thought looks somewhat like the Wittgensteinian `duck-rabbit; since one must constantly turn `from the one hand' (to the grammar) `to the other' (to the Deus ipse narrativus). From the 1960s, one of Jenson's concerns has been the public meaning of Christian language, and the question of how we identify a name for God. Like the grammatical Thomists, he draws on Wittgenstein and on Austin's notion of performatives to fill out the first question; with the Barthians, he affirms that we get our name for God from God. By the late 1960s, the American Thomist schools had begun to interpret Aquinas' idea of `God talk' as referring, not to a real analogy of creaturely and divine things, but to the logic of our language for God. Jenson assumes, with the grammatical Thomists, that the meaning of our language about God is a function of its use. He wants to appropriate both the idea that, for Thomas Aquinas, the primary aspect of analogical `God-talk' is that it refines upon how we use… ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=317))
- For what sustains Christian theological language with a grammatical Thomist like David Burrell is a primitive drive to know God. Thomas' `philosophical grammar, Burrell says, is aimed at `making explicit what a religious life implies'; such an `activity can also be considered as a quest for God'; Thomas' purpose is `to sketch some points of contact between grammar and a religious way of life'; `knowing how to respect the grammatical difference which logic demands for discourse in divinis... requires the disciplines ... associated withreligious living and practice'.66 This is an Augustinian reading of Thomas, one which places his `procedure, not in proximity to Aristotle and thus… ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=330))
- Some scholars, such as the redoubtable Paul Molnar, have criticized narrative theology on the grounds that it ought to have set itself a different objective tothe ones it has, such as the creation of a genuinely God-centred theology.79 It is difficult for a theology to be God-centred if, like movies, it presents `the doing of an image, not the image of a doing'.80 Our argument will be that narrative theology does not achieve its own most valuable aim of reinstating the imaginative and biblical basis of theology. It does not obey the curves of the narrative of salvation history. In order adequately to respond to the images of this revealed history, one needs to know or understand this image, but also to respond to it in love-because the mystery which the God-given image expresses is love. We will argue that, in place of such loving assent, narrative theologies offer a pre-verbal machination of the reality, providing the materials for an abstraction of essence, not for the concretization of an image. Since such cognitive acts do not set the perceiver free to love another as another, narrative theologies substitute a methodology for the personal love of God. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=380))
- What is the purpose of drawing aesthetic perceptions into theology? What good does it serve when Barth, for instance, uses a theologian's aesthetic insight to notice that there is something analogous to space and time in the biblical God, or when he uses the image of the prodigal son's departure into a far country to reflect upon the procession and mission of the divine Son?" The images are an indispensable reminder to Christian theology that our God is, as Bauckham rightly says, not a metaphysical what but a who.82 The authentically Christian function of imagination in theology is to remind us that God is three persons united in love. The Bible images are `done' by a divine act of love. This is imaginative dynamite, and all great theologies have been captivated by the image of the divine as three persons united in love. If the movie parallel is accurate, we may be forced to concede that the story theologians do not make the biblical images an iconostasis of the personal and loving God.

- A methodology is a technique. What matters to method are the protocols, prescriptions and proscriptions which enable it to `do the image'. The technique is abstracted from the `image of a doing'. It is because the technology divests the human act of its human spontaneity and freedom that it is loveless. This human freedom is, we shall argue, analogous to the divine freedom. The human act is most fully itself in responding to the divine act in kind. Is it really like what we know of how human persons manifest themselves to one another to state, with some story Barthians, that, because all of God is revealed in Jesus Christ, that revelation is not the expression of a mystery? Is it comparable to how we know human persons to affirm with the grammatical Thomists that, because we do not know God's essence, God is essentially unknowable? Or are both propositions more akin to the objective auto-projection of a machine than the self-giving of a person? In the 1940s, Karl Barth challenged Hans Urs von Balthasar to make Catholic theology speak more existentially, that is, more Christocentrically. The last… ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=402))
- Like a human painter or sculptor, the biblical God makes with his hands. The crucial difference between cinematography and the other visual arts is that the movie-director has no hands. `Photographs are not hand-made; they are manufactured.' The `material basis of the media of movies (as paint on a flat, delimited support is the material basis of the media of painting) is ... a succession of automatic world projections'.87 If that is an appropriate analogy for the biblical God, then, when He speaks the world into creation, the words can hardly be said to flow from a free gift of love. It will follow that language, the basic media of… ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001E6V56M&location=419))
