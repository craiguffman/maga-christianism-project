### Highlights

- Brunner meant to suggest that the image of God had not been completely destroyed by human sin and disobedience. Remnants of the image were still present in human nature and formed a point of contact for the gospel. Furthermore, the revelation of God in nature was not lost to Christians, who, by using the spectacles of Scripture, could once again know God in and through his works. In all these contentions Brunner claimed Calvin as his ally and mentor. Calvin considers this remnant of the imago Dei to be of great importance. One might almost say that it is one of the pillars supporting his theology, for he identifies it with nothing less than the entire human, rational nature, the immortal soul, the capacity for culture, the conscience, responsibility, the relation with God, which—though not redemptive—exists even in sin, language, the whole of cultural life.2 ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=590))
- Barth argued that Calvin constantly pointed to the Bible as the true source of the knowledge of God. The possibility of a real knowledge by natural man of the true God, derived from creation, is, according to Calvin, a possibility in principle, but not in fact, not a possibility to be realized by us. One might call it an objective possibility, created by God, but not a subjective possibility, open to man. Between what is possible in principle and what is possible in fact there inexorably lies the fall. Hence this possibility can only be discussed hypothetically: si integer stetisset Adam (Inst., I, ii, 1).3 ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=599))
- Because the human race has fallen into sin, the content of its natural knowledge of God is nothing more than idolatry and superstition.4 Therefore, the revelation of God in nature, whatever its original purpose may have been, serves only to render fallen human beings inexcusable and to justify the wrath of God against them.5 As Barth understands… ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=604))
- Unlike Karl Barth, Bouwsma is convinced that Calvin does in fact advocate a natural theology based on natural insight and innate religious instinct.7 While Calvin is not altogether certain “how far or how deep the natural knowledge of God could go,” he is convinced at… ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=611))
- On the question of God’s essence, Bouwsma believes that Calvin is more ambiguous. On the one hand, Calvin warns against speculative theology that attempts to know the essence of God from his works; on the other hand, he regards “every aspect of external nature” as “redolent with religious instruction.”9 Rivers and mountains, birds and flowers, even the human body itself, are important sources for the natural knowledge of God. Calvin is particularly interested in the heavenly bodies as theological tutors and regards astronomy as the alphabet of theology.10 Yet in spite of the fact that Bouwsma has found impressive evidence for a kind of natural theology in Calvin’s thought, he nevertheless concludes that the debate between Brunner, “for whom Calvin… ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=614))
- In what follows, I want to examine one of Calvin’s earliest discussions of natural theology—namely, his exegesis of Rom. 1:18–32—a passage in which the question of the natural knowledge of God is crucial to the development of Paul’s argument. What I hope to demonstrate is that Calvin gives this passage a highly original, if problematic, reading that remains crucial to his later thought. In order to assess the originality of Calvin’s interpretation of Paul, I intend to compare his exegesis with the exegesis of Augustine and four other well-known and widely cited interpreters, who inhabit to a greater or lesser degree Calvin’s own intellectual and spiritual world.14 ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=627))
- Paul takes the line that the pagans did have a knowledge of God from nature and conscience. While this knowledge was primitive in comparison with the rich revelation of God entrusted to the Jews, the really decisive question for Paul was not how much the Gentiles knew, but what they did with what they knew. Although the Gentiles admittedly had little, they abused the little they had. God was therefore within his rights to hold them accountable for their sins and to punish them for their disobedience. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=636))
- Augustine does not seem to have in mind a knowledge of God the Creator through creation possessed by all human beings, but only by some. The wiser Gentiles knew in fact what others could, but did not, know in principle.15 ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=644))
- Denis admits that God has revealed truth to human beings in a variety of ways: through an infusion of wisdom, through angelic revelation, through the teaching of the saints, and through natural reason. Paul, however, is speaking about natural reason in Romans 1.17 Through the influence of the light of natural reason, a rational soul can understand the creator by means of the created order, since effects bear some likeness to the cause in which they participate.18 Specifically, one can know that God is just and wise, that God approves of what is just and disapproves of injustice, and that God deserves reverent worship.19 One can even know the “invisible things” of God; namely, the perfections such as power, justice, and providence that are one in the simple, incorporeal being of God. Furthermore, Denis agrees with John Damascene that all human beings have an innate knowledge of the existence of God.20 If the Gentiles have merited the wrath of God, it is not because they do not know the truth but because they do not obey it. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=649))
- The themes sounded in Augustine and developed by Denis recur in the three Protestant commentators mentioned favorably by Calvin in the preface to his own commentary on Romans: Philip Melanchthon (Wittenberg, 1532), Heinrich Bullinger (Zurich, 1533), and Martin Bucer (Strasbourg, 1534).21 But there are other themes as well. Important to Melanchthon’s treatment of Rom. 1:18–32 is a Lutheran distinction between law and gospel.22 As Melanchthon sees it, Paul posits a natural knowledge of God, but it is a knowledge of the law and not of the gospel.23 What the Gentiles know through nature is that there is a God, that this God is just and requires justice, that he punishes the ungodly, and that he hears and saves whoever is obedient to the law. What cannot be known through natural reason alone is the gospel; namely, that God desires to remit sins, to be reconciled to the unworthy and unclean… ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=658))
- Melanchthon understands Paul to teach that the natural knowledge of God is implanted in the human mind by God and is not simply a conclusion derived from the observation of nature.25 Indeed, reason would not marvel at the works of God in nature if it did not already have an innate, proleptic knowledge of God. The rise and fall of nations, the change of times and seasons, the punishment of the wicked and the terrors of conscience are all testimonies that there is a good and just God, to whom all human beings are responsible. By the exercise of reason the human mind can know that things do not exist through themselves but depend on a prior transcendent cause. This natural knowledge ought not, however, to be confused with speculations concerning the essence of God. Natural knowledge of God is knowledge of God’s will toward sinners, not of his hidden nature.26 Paul is a practical, not a speculative, theologian.… ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=667))
- If Melanchthon’s discussion is dominated by a characteristically Lutheran distinction of law and gospel, Bullinger seems preoccupied with a typically Zwinglian concern with superstition and the cultic use of religious art.29 Bullinger believes that idolators are particularly blameworthy because God has richly revealed himself to them in the natural order. Through the visible order they know that the invisible God is the omnipotent, true, wise, just, good, and supreme Being through whom all things subsist and by whom all things are governed.30 This sentiment is found not only in Paul, but also in the Old Testament and in the writings of the pagan philosophers, especially in the writings of Seneca.31 The Gentiles did not lack all knowledge… ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=679))
- The most extensive discussion of Romans 1 is found in Bucer’s lengthy commentary on Romans.33 Like Melanchthon, Bucer wants to emphasize both the external revelation of God in creation and the internal conception of God imprinted on the human mind. This innate notio Dei is so firmly implanted that it can never be expunged from the mind.34 Bucer cites as proof of his contention the speech of the Stoic philosopher Lucilius Balbus in book 2 of Cicero’s De natura deorum. For Bucer as for Melanchthon it is the innate knowledge of God that predisposes the mind to see the handiwork of God in nature. Because God has revealed himself through nature and the human mind to the Gentiles, who do not worship him, it would seem that this revelation was given in vain. Bucer, however, wants… ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=687))
- In his Conciliatio locorum Bucer distinguishes between two kinds of knowledge of God (duplex notitia Dei): (1) a general or natural knowledge of God given to all human beings who are sound of mind and body and (2) a full and solid knowledge of God, given by the Holy Spirit only to the elect, that generates love and reverence for God.36 The former undercuts human excuses; the latter leads to eternal life. Therefore it can be rightly argued that the Gentiles both know God and do not know him.37 They know God sufficiently to condemn themselves, but… ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=695))
- if we compare the exegesis of Denis the Carthusian with the exegesis of Melanchthon, Bullinger, and Bucer, we can, I think, point to a general consensus on the meaning of Romans 1 that incorporates Augustine’s point in a more complex and nuanced vision. All agree that there is a general knowledge of God from creation that is accessible to human reason apart from grace. This knowledge rests in part on inferences drawn from observation of the created order (Denis, Melanchthon, Bullinger, Bucer) and in part on an innate knowledge implanted in the human mind by God (Denis, Melanch thon, Bucer). All agree that human reason, on whatever grounds, knows that God exists. Melanchthon insists that what fallen human reason knows is God’s will toward us and not God’s essence, though the qualities Melanchthon insists are knowable—that God is just, that he punishes the ungodly, that he hears and saves whoever is obedient to the law—are simply accepted by other theologians as perfections belonging to the divine essence. All agree that while the natural knowledge of God is not saving—and may even need to be corrected by the gospel (Melanchthon)—it is, nevertheless, real knowledge. The problem is not with the quality or even the quantity of knowledge gained by human reason through the natural order. The problem is human sin, which has so weakened human nature (… ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=702))
- While Calvin repeats many of the themes developed by Denis, Melanch thon, Bullinger, and Bucer in his own exegesis of Paul, it is clear that Calvin intends to take the discussion in a somewhat different direction by focusing on the knowing subject and the noetic effects of sin. Calvin certainly agrees that human beings were “formed to be … spectator[s] of the created world” and endowed with eyes to see “the world as a mirror or representation of invisible things” and so to be led through the contemplation of creatures to the praise of their divine Author.38 While Calvin, unlike Melanch thon and Bucer, does not speak of an innate knowledge of God, he does mention “a manifestation of God’s character which is too forceful to allow men to escape from it, since undoubtedly every one of us feels it engraved on his own heart.”39 On the other hand, he immediately qualifies his sole… ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=715))
- Calvin repeats Paul’s argument that pagans naturally know there is a God but “suppress or obscure” his “true knowledge.”41 While the natural order demonstrates the existence of God, it reveals, not God’s essence, but knowledge accommodated to the limited capacity of human beings to comprehend God.42 Calvin calls this a revelation of God’s glory, which he defines as “whatever ought to induce and excite… ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=725))
- At this point Calvin breaks with the exegetical tradition since Augustine by distinguishing sharply between what is offered to natural reason and what is received. On the one hand, Calvin wants to insist that “the manifestation of God by which he makes his glory known among his creatures is sufficiently clear as far as its own light is concerned.”45 On the other hand, he wants to point to the fact of culpable human blindness. The difficulty is not with what is… ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=730))
- The metaphor of blindness, however, is too strong. If blind, then ignorant; if ignorant, then not culpable. The earlier exegetical tradition did not have this problem because it admitted that natural reason knows both that God exists and that God is just, powerful, and providential. Such knowledge is not saving, but it is nevertheless authentic. Calvin realizes that blindness overstates Paul’s case and retreats to the metaphor of severely damaged sight. “We are not so blind,” he concedes, “that we can plead… ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=735))
- The thrust of his argument, however, is that while human beings know that God exists, they misperceive his self-revelation in nature because of the noetic consequences of human sin. Since sin is a condition that is not natural to the human race, but a consequence of Adam’s fall, the misperceptions of the revelation of God in nature are inexcusable. Fallen human beings therefore create fictitious new gods, imaginary pictures, insubstantial phantoms, which they worship in place of God.49 Since all human beings, and not merely philosophers and intellectuals, seek “to form some conception of the majesty of God, and to make Him such a God as their reason could conceive Him to be,” their “presumptuous attitude to God is not … learned in the philosophical schools, but is innate, and accompanies us, so to speak, from the womb.”50 Even Plato,… ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=741))
- One further note, mentioned by Calvin but not developed, is introduced by a reference to Heb. 11:3, which “ascribes to faith the light by which a man can gain a real knowledge [of God] from the work of creation.”52 Calvin suggests that creation, which is no longer an effective source of the knowledge of God for fallen human reason, can be reclaimed as a source by… ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=749))
- If we compare Calvin’s exegesis with the exegesis of Denis, Melanchthon, Bullinger, and Bucer, we find some points of agreement among them. All agree that the created world demonstrates God’s existence and that human beings without exception know by nature that there is a God. Calvin even agrees that the world is a mirror of God’s glory, and that it reveals enough of God’s will and nature to stimulate human beings to praise and glorify God.53 Calvin demurs, however, when the other interpreters of Paul argue that human beings have a reliable, if rudimentary, knowledge of the will or essence of God.54 The problem is not with the objective revelation of God in nature but with the perception of God by fallen human reason. Human beings are very nearly blind because of sin. Since they know that there is a God and since they misperceive the self-revelation of God in creation, they… ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=753))
- These ideas, sketched in all too brief a form in the commentary on Romans, are expanded and developed in successive editions of the Institutes, beginning with the 1539 edition. For example, in the Institutes Calvin adopts the theme of an innate knowledge of God’s existence (sensus divinitatis), advocated by Denis, Melanchthon, and Bucer, and missing or at best only hinted at in his interpretation of Romans 1.55 Furthermore, his clumsy use of a blindness “not so blind” is replaced by a more satisfying appeal to the metaphor of… ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=763))
- What is striking, however, is the singularity of Calvin’s reading of Paul. In the judgment of Calvin’s contemporaries, Paul does not stress an acute noetic impairment because of sin or distinguish sharply between what is revealed in nature and what is perceived by fallen human reason. The thrust of Paul’s argument, indeed, runs in the opposite direction. The point that Paul makes is not how little the Gentiles knew, but, considering the circumstances, how much they did know and how little use they made of it. By stressing the damage human… ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=768))
- Other Protestant theologians, of whom Melanchthon may be taken as representative, tend to argue that God is revealed in nature, that this revelation, however limited and inadequate, is nevertheless perceived by fallen human beings, who, precisely because of their sinfulness, proceed to suppress, distort, deny, ignore, forget, and abuse what they know.57 Calvin argues, rather, that God is revealed in nature, that this revelation is misperceived by fallen human beings, who, precisely because of their sinful and… ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=774))
- Calvin avoids the difficulties he has placed in his own path by arguing that human blindness is culpable; but it is an argument which, in the form Calvin presents it, is not embraced by Denis, Melanchthon, Bullinger, or Bucer. These four commentators are joined in their dissent by Desiderius Erasmus,58 Faber Stapulensis,59 Martin Luther,60 Huldrych Zwingli,61 Johannes Oecolampadius,62 Erasmus Sarcerius,63 Andreas Knöpken,64 Johannes Bugenhagen,65 Thomas de Vio (Cajetan),66 Johannes Lonicer,67 Jean de Gagney,68 Jacopo Sadoleto,69 Ambrosius Catherinus Politus,70 Marino Grimani,71 Johannes Arboreus,72 Claude… ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=779))
- The distinction between what is offered by God and what is received by fallen human beings is echoed in Calvin’s eucharistic theology. The question had been posed many times whether unbelievers receive the body and blood of Christ when they take the elements of bread and wine. Calvin argues that the substance of Christ’s body and blood is offered to the congregation in the eucharist, whenever it is celebrated, but can only be received by faith. Men and women who lack faith participate in the simple meal of bread and wine and not in the spiritual real presence of Christ. Christ is truly offered whether faith is present or absent; Christ is truly received only when faith is present.85 ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=802))
- In short, Calvin draws a distinction between what is offered and received that becomes a guiding principle of his thought, even outside the context of natural theology. In spite of the human fall into sin, the created order continues to function as a theater of God’s glory. The whole world is, to use Bouwsma’s phrase, “redolent with religious instruction.” While fallen human reason perceives that God exists, it misperceives what God is like. Only when reason is illumined by faith can it once again see the world for what it is, a mirror of divine glory. On this fundamental point Calvin is, I think, sometimes ambiguous, but never ambivalent. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=807))
- The medieval distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God is a distinction in Christian theology between what God can do in view of his sheer and unlimited ability to act and what he has chosen to do in the light of his wise and sometimes inscrutable purposes. God cannot, of course, will his own nonexistence or suspend the principle of non contradiction. Omnipotence does not extend to the production of nonsense. But apart from these limitations, the sovereignty of God is absolute. Whatever God chooses to do (excluding, of course, what is inherently self-contradictory), God can do. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1007))
- In the third book of the Institutes (III.xxiii.2) Calvin attacked the distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God as a speculative doctrine that separates the omnipotence of God from his justice and transforms the compassionate Father of the biblical narratives into an arbitrary tyrant. Anyone who has ever tried to trace Calvin’s relationship to his sources knows how difficult it is and how few clues Calvin himself provides. What clues there are in the text, however, suggest that Calvin is drawn to the position of Duns Scotus—and, to a lesser extent, William Ockham—on several controverted issues. Like Scotus, Calvin stresses the priority of predestination to glory over predestination to grace (III.xxii.9) and argues that whatever God wills, “by the very fact that He wills it, must be considered righteous” (III.xxiii.2). Like Scotus and Ockham, Calvin wishes to preserve the transcendent freedom of God and to stress the radical contingency of the world and of all created being. It therefore comes as a shock that Calvin refuses to accept the very distinction they used to safeguard God’s transcendent freedom and to underscore the world’s radical contingency. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1017))
- The distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God was first suggested by medieval theologians in the late eleventh century. By the twelfth century it was a distinction common to all the theological schools.4 In the thirteenth century Thomas Aquinas discussed the distinction in his disputation De Potentia Dei q.1 a.5 as well in the Summa Theologiae I q.25 a.5 and in II Summa contra Gentiles c.23–30. Thomas used the distinction to make the point that God’s actions are free and not subject to necessity. Although the created order expresses God’s wisdom, justice, and goodness, it does not exhaust them. God could have created de potentia absoluta a quite different order of the world and yet one in which his wisdom, justice, and goodness would still have found adequate expression. Thomas made this point in order to reject all necessitarian doctrines of God, whether pagan, Islamic, or Christian in origin, and to emphasize the contingency of the created order. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1041))
- The revisionists admit that it is true that nominalists celebrate the absolute freedom and transcendence of God. God is exlex, free from all claims and demands external to his own will. Prior to his self-revelation, God is unpredictable and unknowable. One cannot apply human concepts of justice to the justice by which God guides his actions in history. God is a free and sovereign Lord who acts in a manner that cannot be anticipated and which appears at first glance scandalous and an affront to reason. The absolute power of God means not only that God is utterly free but that the created order is radically contingent. ([Location 1081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1081))
- But while God is radically free from external limitations, he is not free from limitations that he has imposed upon himself. According to nominalist theology, God enters into covenants that restrict his freedom and that he regards as permanently binding. God could, had he chosen to do so, justify a sinner who lacks an infused habit of grace or refuse to accept a viator who has one. The point is that he does not choose to do so de potentia ordinata. Having limited himself by his covenant to justify sinners who are infused by a habit of grace, he remains faithful to his decision. The fidelity of God to his covenants de potentia ordinata is a central theme of late medieval nominalism. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1085))
- When the Scotists and Occamists celebrated the freedom and transcendence of a God who, although under no natural obligation to his creation, nevertheless bound himself to fulfill the terms of certain freely assumed covenantal obligations, they were returning to a theme which had a long and venerable tradition in Western thought, beginning with St. Augustine and continuing through such early Franciscan theologians as Odo Rigaldi.32 Ideas concerning covenant and promise that seem radical in the fifteenth century were already taught by Cardinal Laborans and his contemporaries in the twelfth century.33 Indeed, the notion that human merit should be established primarily on the basis of the covenant and promise of God34 rather than on ontological grounds is a dominant motif if one takes the whole Middle Ages and not merely the thirteenth century into account. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1091))
- The absolute power of God, therefore, must always be kept in tension with his ordained power. The fidelity of God to his covenants is just as important to late medieval theologians as the fact of his utter transcendence and radical freedom. Secondary causes are not suspended, though God by his absolute power could dispense with them. The point which Scotus and Ockham make is that the present order is radically contingent, not that it is thoroughly unreliable. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1098))
- What remains constant in the history of the use of this distinction is the continuing attempt by medieval theologians to protect the freedom and transcendence of God and to stress, for whatever reasons, the contingency of the created order. Thomas and Ockham did not altogether agree about what threatens the doctrine of that freedom, and they certainly differed with each other about what God had bound himself to do. This distinction remained serviceable to Christian theologians who disagreed about many other matters because they shared a common conviction that creation did not exhaust the possibilities open to God and that divine omnipotence stretches beyond the furthest bounds the human imagination can reach. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1126))
- Sarah’s laughter leads Calvin to make two points to his readers. The first is to warn them not to limit the power of God to the “scanty measure” of their own reason. They doubt God’s promises because like Sarah they “sinfully detract from his power.” But the second touches on the distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God. God’s power should only be considered in the context of God’s Word, what God can do in the framework of his declared will. In this way the Papists plunge themselves into a profound labyrinth, when they dispute concerning the absolute power of God. Therefore, unless we are willing to be involved in absurd dotings, it is necessary that the word should precede us like a lamp; so that his power and will may be conjoined by an inseparable bond.41 ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1140))
- The pagan notion that there are no gods and that the world is at the mercy of irrational fortune is not an idea that Jeremiah seriously entertains. He knows that there is a God and that this God governs the world by his providence. Jeremiah’s task is therefore to show that this God is just and that “the disorder in the world”43 does not reflect any disorder in God. The wicked have mistaken God’s forbearance for God’s favor. Indeed, the wicked are accumulating a “heavier vengeance” for themselves on the day of judgment by their continued abuse of God’s patience.44 What Jeremiah does not do is “set up the judgments of men against the absolute power of God, as the sophists under the Papacy do, who ascribe such absolute power to God as perverts all judgment and all order; this is nothing less than sacrilege.”45 What he does do is suggest to God (and to the wicked who are listening to this conversation) that it may be time on the basis of God’s declared will in the Torah to bring this period of patience and forbearance to an end. God’s justice may be slow but it has not arbitrarily been set aside. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1153))
- Calvin is unwilling to entertain even a hypothetical separation of God’s power from his justice. Of course, Scotus and Ockham do not seriously intend to separate God’s power from God’s justice, except as an experiment in thought. But Calvin refuses to do even that. God’s power and justice are so tightly bound together that they cannot be separated. What the scholastics regard as a useful experiment in thought, Calvin regards as shocking blasphemy. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1208))
- Calvin reads the distinction between the potentia absoluta and the potentia ordinata, not as a distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God, but as a distinction between potentia ordinata and inordinata, between “ordered” and “disordered” power. What the scholastics call the absolute power of God is a disordered power because it disjoins God’s power from his justice. In that sense all power of God, realized and unrealized, actual and potential, is potentia ordinata, power ordered by God’s justice. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1215))
- Calvin, who hates and fears disorder in a fallen world, refuses to accept the idea that the disorder and confusion in the world are in any sense a reflection of disorder in the will of God. Whatever God has done, is doing, or plans to do is an expression of his potentia ordinata, even if the justice that guides his will is secret and hidden from us. That ordered power is displayed in miracles, providence, and predestination. Indeed, even the impenetrable darkness outside revelation cannot rob the godly of their confidence that the hidden power of God is not the power of an arbitrary tyrant, but the infinite power of a just Father. ([Location 1220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=1220))
- In short, Calvin is not opposed to the points made by Scotus and Ockham about the freedom and transcendence of God and at times sounds more Scotistic that Scotus himself. But he finds it impossible to make those points by appealing to the theological distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God. Absolute power is for him disordered power, omnipotence divorced from justice. The will of God may be hidden and mysterious; it may even contradict human concepts of justice, but it is not disordered. Calvin is therefore not only opposed to the abuse of this doctrine, as Turrettini speculated; he is opposed to the distinction as such.

- Among Calvin’s closest allies and friends in Strasbourg was an ex-Dominican priest, Martin Bucer (1491–1551). Bucer had entered the Dominican Order in 1506 at the age of fifteen. In 1516 he transferred to the Blackfriars cloister in Heidelberg, where in April 1518 he heard Martin Luther preside at a theological disputation sponsored by Luther’s own order, the Hermits of St. Augustine. Bucer was so captivated by Luther’s thought that he applied for release from the Dominican Order and in 1521 became a simple parish priest in Landstuhl. After brief parochial duty in Landstuhl and Weissenburg, Bucer fled for refuge to the free imperial city of Strasbourg, where he became the pastor in turn of the churches of St. Aurelia (1524–31) and St. Thomas (1531–40). From Strasbourg he swiftly rose to prominence as one of the principal leaders of the Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire.

- What I propose to do in this chapter is to examine the exegesis of Romans 9 by Thomas Aquinas, Martin Bucer, and John Calvin, in order to isolate the agreements and disagreements among them and to deter mine whether those agreements and disagreements argue for or against the presence of a common school tradition.4 In order to provide a contemporary context for Bucer’s exegesis, I will compare Bucer’s interpretation of Paul at several points with the exegesis of two prominent Dominican theologians who did not become Protestants, Thomas de Vio, known as Cajetan (1468–1534), and Ambrosius Catherinus Politus (1484–1553). ([Location 3405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3405))
- Although Bucer is indebted, at least to some extent, to Thomas for his under standing of free choice and the role of second causes, his discussion of election shows little direct dependence on Thomas’s exegesis. Unlike Thomas, Bucer does not distinguish between election and predestination or attempt to offer a theodicy based on an argument from design. Whereas Thomas emphasizes the justice of God that permits and then punishes the wickedness of the reprobate, Bucer appeals to the wisdom and goodness of God that merits un wavering confidence and trust. Although Bucer sounds some specifically Thomistic themes in his exposition of Paul, it is probably more accurate to say that Bucer, like Thomas, embraces a strongly Augustinian view of election than to say he embraces it in a distinctively Thomistic way. ([Location 3592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3592))
- The list of agreements between Thomas, Bucer, and Calvin is impressive: all three reject predestination based on foreknowledge, insist that human salvation is dependent on God’s election alone, confess that there is no reason higher than God’s own will for the election of some over others, and affirm the justice of God in the punishment of the reprobate. Furthermore, Calvin shares with Bucer a horror of speculative theology that attempts to probe the mystery of predestination beyond the limits set by God’s self-revelation in Scripture.55 Yet there are differences among the three, some substantial, some simply a matter of nuance. ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3603))
- Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that Calvin declines to offer more than a sketchy apologetic for God’s justice, he does make some attempt to explain how God’s electing and reprobating activity should be viewed. The apologetic has three elements: (1) God is debtor to no human being and so may confer his kindness on whomever he will.66 This argument is strikingly similar to Thomas’s contention that distributive justice has no place outside ex debito relations. (2) The reprobate are in fact wicked and are therefore justly punished by God. Indeed, the godly praise God all the more when they contemplate the wretchedness of the ungodly, who do not escape God’s wrath.67 (3) Finally, the power that God exercises over his creatures is not an inordinate, but an equitable right, similar in every respect to the power of a potter over his clay.68 Therefore, both the salvation of the elect and the punishment of the reprobate demonstrate God’s “unimpeachable equity,” even though there is no reason why God elects except his purpose alone.69 ([Location 3627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3627))
- Calvin breaks most sharply with Thomas (and, to a more limited extent, with Bucer) over the question of the hardening of Pharaoh. Calvin complains that many interpreters attempt to mitigate the harshness of 9:17–18 by appealing to God’s permissive will, which leaves the nonelect to their own devices, or by positing a general impulse from God that is abused by the wicked.70 The notion that Pharaoh had been aroused by God to defend his realm but abused this impulse when he repressed the Israelites or that equates hardening with the noninterposition of grace is flatly rejected by Calvin. God did not merely move or permit Pharaoh to be hardened; God hardened Pharaoh in order to destroy him. The ruin of the ungodly is not merely foreseen or permitted by God, but ordained.71 The asymmetrical relationship between election and reprobation so carefully worked out by Thomas is flattened into a harsher symmetry by Calvin. ([Location 3636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3636))
- If the question of reprobation is set aside, it would be difficult to find three more vigorous exponents of an Augustinian reading of Romans 9 than Thomas Aquinas, Martin Bucer, and John Calvin. All three reject predestination based on God’s foreknowledge of human merit, insist that human salvation is grounded in divine election alone, acknowledge that there is no reason higher than God’s will for the election of Isaac and Jacob over Ishmael and Esau, and assert that God is just in the punishment of the reprobate. While there are differences between them in matters of detail, there are no significant differences between them in matters of substance. ([Location 3649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3649))
- Bucer, who accepts the important role of second causes, is clearly more receptive to Thomas’s ideas than is Calvin, who rejects Thomas’s notion of a general impulse toward the good and finds no place in his theology for divine permission. This difference between Bucer and Calvin becomes evident when the question on the table is the reprobation of the nonelect. Thomas, Bucer, and Calvin all agree that the final explanation for reprobation, as for election itself, lies in the mystery of the divine will. The nonelection of Esau, like the election of Jacob, rests on God’s free decision and therefore remains a mystery that cannot be rationalized. Yet the response of Thomas and Bucer to this mystery differs from Calvin’s response. Thomas defends God’s justice, while Bucer recommends God’s goodness. Against both, Calvin understands himself to be maintaining God’s honor. ([Location 3658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3658))
- The thesis that Calvin is the beneficiary of a Thomistic school tradition mediated to him by Martin Bucer finds no support in the admittedly limited context of the interpretation of Romans 9. Although it is true that Calvin agrees with Thomas and Bucer on most exegetical issues and that Bucer adopts some themes from Thomas in his interpretation of Paul, their agreement may be better explained by appealing to a common Augustinian heritage than to a common school tradition. Indeed, on the issue of the justice of God’s action, Calvin shows himself unfriendly to what he regards as the misguided attempt of Thomas and others to mitigate the harshness of God’s decree. Calvin wants to fix the unwavering attention of all theologians, including Thomas and Bucer, on the “eternal and inexplicable counsel of God, whose righteousness is worthy of our worship rather than our scrutiny.”74 ([Location 3670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=3670))
- Calvin’s support of Luther, however, was not unqualified. In the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), Calvin, who had modeled his Institutes on Luther’s Smaller Catechism, criticized Luther’s doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, repudiating especially his doctrine of the ubiquity of Christ’s body. Luther taught that the body of the risen Christ was no longer subject to the limitations of space and time and so could be present to believers in, with, and under the consecrated elements of bread and wine. Calvin agreed with Luther’s opponent, Huldrych Zwingli, that Christ assumed a finite humanity, which remained finite even after his resurrection and ascension. The body of Christ, like every human body, “has a fixed dimension, is contained in a place, is touched” and “seen.”2 ([Location 4140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4140))
- In the Consensus Tigurinus, written in 1549 and published in 1551, Calvin and Zwingli’s successor at Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, attempted to bridge their disagreements by confessing that sacraments are “instruments by which God acts efficaciously when he pleases” and not simply signs of God’s invisible and unmediated activity.5 To be sure, their joint confession is hedged with qualifications intended to quiet Zwinglian fears that too much has been conceded to external rites and ceremonies. For example, the Consensus insists that sacraments are powerless to confer grace apart from the action of God, who alone effects what the sacraments figure.6 Nevertheless, Calvin and Bullinger were able to agree that sacraments are “instruments,” “signs,” “helps,” and “seals” (organa, signa, adminicula, sigilla) God uses to offer “Christ with all his gifts … to all in common.”7 In careful language that corrects what Calvin had regarded as Zwingli’s chief error, the Consensus distinguishes between signs and things signified without disjoining the reality offered to faith from the signs that offer it.8 ([Location 4154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4154))
- Calvin offers four ways in which the distance between the believer and the ascended humanity of Christ can be overcome. The first means for bridging the distance between heaven and earth depends not so much on the descent of Christ as on the ascent of the believer.39 When Christians participate in the eucharist they ascend in the ecstasy of faith to the right hand of God, where they contemplate the risen Christ, seated at the right hand of God the Father. The spiritual experience of believers, the sursum corda of their faith is one, though by no means the most important, ladder linking heaven and earth. More important for Calvin than the spiritual ecstasy of faith is the threefold descent of Christ by his virtue, Spirit, and divine nature. By virtue Calvin means the boundless power of Christ for our salvation.40 Calvin is willing to concede that the substance of the body of Christ is present in the eucharist, if the word substance is properly defined.41 The substance of the body of Christ is not veins and sinews, but rather the power and effect of Christ’s crucified and risen humanity for the redemption of the world. Christ is substantially present in the eucharist when he bridges the chasm between heaven and earth by his boundless redemptive power. Christ descends from heaven to earth, not only by his boundless power, but also by his Spirit.42 Since Calvin regards the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of the Son as well as of the Father, he converses readily about the presence of Christ in the church by the Spirit. Because Christ’s Spirit is not limited by space and time, as Christ’s finite humanity is, it can bridge all distances between heaven and earth, including the distance between the right hand of God and the eucharist. Where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there Christ is present. ([Location 4282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4282))
- Calvin’s problem is to explain how the humanity of Christ, though absent from the bread and wine in one sense, is nevertheless present in another. Calvin’s explanation involves the invocation of two christological principles. The first principle is one that Tilemann Hesshusen has already invoked—namely, the union of two natures in Christ. The divine nature of Christ is omnipresent; the human nature is not. Nevertheless, wherever Christ’s divine nature is present, it is present as a nature indissolubly united to Christ’s humanity. To encounter Christ’s divine nature is not to encounter a discarnate, disembodied deity. Therefore, wherever Christ is present, both natures are present, even though the finite humanity of Christ is seated at God’s right hand. This point can be restated as Calvin’s second principle—namely, that the whole Christ can be present even where Christ is not wholly present (totus Christus sed non totum).44 ([Location 4305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4305))
- By denying the manducatio infidelium, Calvin does not mean to deny that Christ is really offered in the eucharist to the entire gathered congregation, believers and unbelievers alike. Christ with all his benefits is offered in the eucharist to men and women without distinction. In that sense Calvin agrees with Hesshusen and the medieval Catholic tradition that the real presence of Christ is not dependent on human faith. On the other hand, Christ, who is offered to all, is authentically received only by believers. Unlike Hess husen, Calvin draws a sharp distinction in his eucharistic theology between what is offered and what can be received.46 ([Location 4316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4316))
- From Calvin’s perspective, the Lutheran doctrine of the eucharist rests on three absurdities: the distinction of definitive from local presence (which Hesshusen affirms);48 the doctrine of the ubiquity of the body of Christ (which Hesshusen denies in principle but admits in practice);49 and the notion of physical reception of the body of Christ (which Hesshusen accepts with certain qualifications).50 Christ does not pass through the door (as Luther and Hesshusen contend in their defense of definitive presence), but simply appears in the room with his disciples. Christ’s body is not ubiquitous, in either Luther’s or Hesshusen’s sense, unless one wishes to contend that Christ has a monstrous, inhuman body, in no way similar to ours. Christ is not chewed by the teeth (as Westphal, that new Berengarius, proclaims)51 or even taken by the mouth (as Hesshusen argues),52 but is offered to the mouth of faith.53 ([Location 4326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4326))
- When Hesshusen attempts to mimic Luther by decrying reason, he only succeeds in revealing his theological confusion. In his general condemnation of human reason, Hesshusen fails to distinguish between three kinds of reason: (1) “reason naturally implanted,” which “cannot be condemned without insult to God”; (2) “vitiated reason,” which subjects the self-revelation of God to human judgment and arrogance; and (3) “reason … derived from the Word of God,” which grounds its point of view in the teaching of Scripture.57 This third form of reason, reason derived from the Word of God, is antithetical to the judgments of vitiated reason, but not to faithful theological inquiry. ([Location 4343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4343))
- Calvin describes the original controversy over the Lord’s Supper as a controversy between Lutherans who alleged “that the grace of the Spirit was tied to external elements” and Zwinglians who contended “that only bare and empty figures like theatrical shows were left.”61 In Calvin’s view, “this contention has now ceased.”62 The controversy between Lutherans and non-Lutherans is no longer over the fact of real presence, which is conceded by Calvin and the Zwinglians alike, but over the mode of eating.63 ([Location 4358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4358))
- Although he is not prepared to abandon altogether the place of figurative language, he devotes his principal attention in the controversy with Hesshusen to the explication of the reality of Christ’s presence. “When I say,” writes Calvin, that the flesh and blood of Christ are substantially offered and exhibited to us in the Supper, I at the same time explain the mode, namely that the flesh of Christ becomes vivifying to us, inasmuch as Christ, by the incomprehensible virtue of his Spirit, transfuses his own proper life into us from the substance of his flesh, so that he himself lives in us, and his life is common to us. ([Location 4368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4368))
- For Luther, the question is how Christ who is already present, even in unconsecrated bread and wine, can be present for me. For Calvin, as for Hesshusen, the question is how Christ who is absent in his finite humanity can bridge the distance between heaven and earth with his saving presence. ([Location 4376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=4376))
- What I intend to do in this essay is first to describe scholasticism and scholastic method as briefly and as accurately as I can and then to reexamine Calvin’s relationship to it. What I hope to show is that Calvin’s relationship to it was both more positive and more profound than is commonly assumed. While it is clear that Calvin was not a scholastic in one sense, it is not so clear that he was not a scholastic in another. ([Location 5942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=5942))
- Lombard organized his four books of Sentences according to two distinctions in the theology of St. Augustine: the distinction between two kinds of loving as indicated by two Latin verbs, uti and frui, and the distinction between signs (signa) and things (res).7 The verb frui means to love a thing with the love of enjoyment. Things can be enjoyed if they are loved as ends and not as the means toward some other higher end.8 In Augustine’s view only God could be loved with a love of enjoyment, since only God could be loved for himself alone. The verb uti means to love a thing, not for itself, but as a means toward something else. Because everything that is not God—that is, the whole realm of creatures—could only be loved as a means that deflects one’s final love toward God, the verb uti describes the love that is owed to creation. ([Location 5973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=5973))
- Book 1 deals with things to be enjoyed, that is, it deals with the triune God who is to be loved with the love of enjoyment. Book 2 deals with things to be used as means, that is, it deals with creation, which is to be loved with the love of use. Book 3 deals with things to be loved both as an end and as a means, that is, it deals with Jesus Christ, the God-man, who insofar as he is divine may be enjoyed and insofar as he is a creature used. Finally, book 4 deals with signs, that is, it deals with the church’s sacraments. ([Location 5981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=5981))
- Scholastic theologians were well aware that asking the right questions is the first and indispensable step in arriving at a knowledge of the truth. They were also well aware that rhetorical solutions that glossed over the difficulties in an issue with a homiletical nostrum did not advance the church’s knowledge. Their ideal was to proceed by careful argument, firmly rooted in the texts Lombard had assembled, to a more adequate grasp of Christian truth, never raising their voices in anger when their arguments failed or appealing to the prejudices of their readers or listeners. ([Location 5986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=5986))
- Exegesis alone could not answer such questions. Scholastic masters, while grounding their arguments in the Bible and tradition, hoped so to pattern the minds of their students with the logic of Christian faith that they could witness to the gospel without losing themselves in unresolved contradictions, logical absurdities, imprecise definitions, or maudlin sentimentality. Clear thinking about theological issues was an important skill for a university don to cultivate. It was an equally important skill for a bishop, entrusted with the care of souls. ([Location 5996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=5996))
- The second major element in the scholastic theological program was its exegetical component.12 Medieval theologians did not draw a sharp distinction as we would between biblical exegesis and dogmatic theology. The words theology and sacred page could be used interchangeably, since biblical interpretation was by definition theological, and dogmatic theology exegetical. The texts, of course, differed. Exegesis proper (in our sense) required the text of the Ordinary Gloss as its foundation, while dogmatic lectures (again in our sense) regularly took the form of commentary on the Sentences. Exegetical lectures followed the text of whatever biblical book was under discussion from the first verse of the first chapter to the last verse of the last chapter. Theological lectures followed the order of distinctions or topics in the Sentences, moving from subject to subject rather than from verse to verse. At the same time it should be noted that a fair amount of the Patristic material in the Sentences had been culled by Peter Lombard from the Ordinary Gloss.13 ([Location 6008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6008))
- While a newly minted Master had many duties, he was free to lecture either on the Bible or on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. In the early scholastic period he would have been expected to lecture primarily on the literal sense of the Bible.15 His students had already been taken by a teaching assistant (the cursor or baccalaureus biblicus) through a quick survey of the glossed biblical text. It was his duty to open up the mysteries of divine revelation by a thorough attention to the Latin text that presupposed his mastery of text, glosses, and the theological distinctions in Lombard. ([Location 6021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6021))
- There were, however, questions that could not be answered on the basis of the biblical exegesis alone. While the scholastics thought the Bible taught a rudimentary anthropology and psychology, they did not think they could derive an analysis of the powers of the human soul from the Bible. But an analysis of the powers of the soul might in fact be important in order to understand the nature of contrition or the possibility of union of the soul with God in this life. Calvin agreed with the scholastics that the philosophers taught things about the nature and powers of the human soul that were useful for Christians to know. God is, after all, the Creator and Redeemer of heaven and earth and all that they contain. Yet not everything necessary and useful to know about heaven and earth can be found in the pages of the Bible. Therefore, scholastic theologians made free use of the philosophers, not as a substitute for divine revelation and never willingly in contradiction to it. Philosophy was a good gift of God to human beings made in the rational image of God and like God capable of creative thought. ([Location 6026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6026))
- It is probably never possible or even desirable for Christian theologians to become overly loyal to a single philosopher, since the odd shape of the Christian faith forces a kind of philosophical eclecticism on its serious practitioners. No philosophy—not the philosophy of Aristotle or Plato or Kant or Hegel or Kierkegaard—is exactly cut to the shape of divine revelation. The Aristotle whom Christian scholastics adopted was an Aristotle who had been baptized, chastened, and corrected by Christian theology and shorn of his most incorrigibly pagan convictions. Thomas Aquinas, to take a famous example, is frequently described as an Aristotelian. But Thomas was not so loyal to the opinions of Aristotle that he did not abandon them when what he regarded as better opinions could be found elsewhere. One has only to consider how important the theme of participation was to Thomas to see… ([Location 6036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6036))
- It is important to keep clearly in mind how important biblical exegesis was to the scholastic enterprise. The essence of scholasticism cannot be found in distinctions, questions, and disputations alone. Nor was exegesis scholastic only when the lecturer drew a distinction, composed a syllogism, or raised a disputed question. Central to the scholastic… ([Location 6044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6044))
- If we compare Calvin’s biblical commentaries with late medieval lectures on the Bible, we see similar differences. Calvin did not comment on the glossed Latin text but on the unglossed Greek and Hebrew text. For Calvin, who even took the Hebrew and Greek Bibles with him into the pulpit, the Bible could not be properly understood without a mastery of the original languages in which it was written. ([Location 6060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6060))
- Calvin made only limited use of philosophy. It is obvious from what he wrote that he had read philosophy and approved of themes and ideas from various philosophers. He appealed to an innate sense of divinity, which he derived from Cicero rather than from St. Paul, and used the notion to clarify what Paul had written about the Gentiles in Rom. 1:18–32.17 He employed a causal scheme borrowed from Aristotle to set in order the causes of salvation, accepting as well a scholastic distinction between consequent necessity and necessity of the consequence.18 He commended philosophers for their analysis of the powers of the soul, and although he did not single out one philosopher for special commendation, his general recommendation surely covered Aristotle’s De anima, on which his friend Melanchthon had written a commentary.19 ([Location 6071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6071))
- Like most of the Protestant theologians of his generation (Melanchthon, Zanchi, and Musculus are obvious, if partial, exceptions), Calvin set out to write a theology that was wholly exegetical. If he did not entirely succeed (and no one who professes the doctrine of the Trinity can entirely succeed), it was not for lack of resolution. Like many early Protestants he was in the grip of an exegetical optimism that proved not altogether workable in practice. Melanchthon abandoned philosophy only to take it up again. Calvin discovered that some philosophical distinctions, including many of the distinctions drawn by the schoolmen, were too useful to be discarded lightly. If one objects that there is still very little philosophy in Calvin’s late theological and exegetical writings, the obvious reply is that there is even less in Peter Lombard. ([Location 6079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6079))
- Yet, in spite of Calvin’s resolution to avoid what he regarded as the failings of scholasticism, anyone who reads the preface to his Commentary on Romans will be struck by the similarity between his bipolar program for writing theological and exegetical works and the bipolar theological and exegetical agenda of medieval scholasticism.20 Like the scholastics and unlike the early Christian Fathers, Calvin announced his intention to write not only exegesis (with, perhaps, occasional writings on limited themes), but also a book which organized theology by topic. Topical discussions would allow Calvin to address complex doctrinal issues in a separate volume without interrupting the flow of exegesis in his commentaries. At the same time, such topical discussions could provide an indispensable frame of reference within which to read and comprehend Scripture. ([Location 6085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6085))
- The question also has to be raised whether Calvin has in certain cases understood the scholastic theologians correctly. For example, in treating the scholastic distinction between the absolute and the ordained power of God, Calvin misstated what the scholastics meant by the use of this distinction, restated what he regarded as the correct answer (which was, more or less, what the scholastics taught when they drew the distinction), and concluded, quite wrongly, that he and the scholastics were worlds apart.23 Either Calvin did not understand the distinction and simply made a mistake; or he understood the distinction correctly but was disingenuous and misstated the position of the scholastics in order to score a cheap point; or he first encountered this distinction in the teaching of a third party, who had himself misunderstood what the scholastics intended and so misled Calvin. I am inclined in this case to apply the hermeneutic of charity and to assume that Calvin, who after all was educated as a lawyer rather than as a theologian, made an honest mistake and misrepresented the scholastics unwittingly. However, the point I want to emphasize is that Calvin and the scholastics were in agreement on the substance of the issue, even though Calvin himself was convinced that they differed. ([Location 6106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6106))
- If one compares Calvin’s doctrine of predestination with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus, one will undoubtedly be impressed with how close they were to each other, in large measure because each remained close to Augustine.24 All three, for example, rejected as Pelagian the notion that predestination was based on God’s foreknowledge of human good works or even of a good use of grace. However, on other issues on which Scotus differed with Thomas Aquinas, Calvin unfailingly chose the position of Scotus. Like Scotus and unlike Thomas, Calvin asserted that predestination was first to glory and only then to grace and that whatever God willed was by that very fact righteous and just, propositions that Thomas could not accept in the form in which Scotus and Calvin taught them.25 ([Location 6117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6117))
- What I want to do is suggest another way to approach this issue, one that focuses on the parish rather than on the university as the locus for the pursuit of a kind of school theology. When Calvin was asked to define the church, he took the famous dictum of Cyprian—one cannot have God for a Father who does not have the church for a mother—and modified it to describe the church as both mother and school.26 Scholastic theology was, as the name implies, theology appropriate to a school. If, as… ([Location 6126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6126))
- Medieval scholastic theology was also developed for a particular kind of school. The medieval school was not a public school open to laity. It was not even a clerical school open to all of the clergy. It was an elite school for the training of the church’s leadership. Some of the young clergy who studied theology at such schools became teachers themselves. Most were recruited to serve in positions of leadership in their diocese or order. The parish was not regarded in the medieval church as the appropriate place for the pursuit of scholastic theology. The parish priest was frequently a man of limited education, often not much different from the people he served. He said prayers for the community, baptized their children, married their couples, blessed their homes, and buried their parents. He presided at worship and heard their annual confession before Easter mass.27 He might preach or he might not. Laypeople could always hear a sermon in a Dominican or Franciscan church if there were one nearby. Some might even be lucky enough to live in a larger town with a well-known preacher supported by public funds. But theology was not as central to the life of the late medieval community as it would become in early Protestant churches. The local parish was… ([Location 6131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6131))
- Calvin knew perfectly well that not every member of the church was capable of theological reflection at an advanced level. Many of his sermons dealt with exegetical questions at a somewhat lower level of difficulty than his commentaries. Even his French translation of the Institutes, prepared for people of lesser culture who did not read Latin, added explanations that were missing in the Latin text. Nevertheless, the fact that Calvin regarded the church as both mother and school meant that in his view all Christians, no matter how limited their capacity, had a theological task to discharge. They could not sidestep their theological responsibility by relying on implicit faith and claiming, as they had once done in the old church, that they believed whatever the church taught.28 That was far too indolent a faith. The church was school, not only for an elite, but also for quite ordinary people. The broadening of access to theological education may also help to explain Calvin’s impatience with what he regarded as excessive speculation in medieval scholasticism. A clerical elite could spare the time to consider questions that were only experiments in thought. But a church focused on the theological education of ordinary men and women, particularly ordinary men and women who had been incorrectly formed in the Christian faith by the late medieval church, could not afford such a luxury.29 ([Location 6148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6148))
- Not everything, of course, was reconceived. Many of the functions of the old parish priest were still discharged by the new Reformed parson, who baptized, catechized, married, and interred his parishioners. The new minister presided at the eucharist four times a year and preached at every worship service, though preaching, which had been a peripheral duty in the late medieval church, now became central, while the celebration of the eucharist, which had been primary, became comparatively infrequent. Moreover, Calvin and his allies were unwilling to restrict themselves in their preaching to a few comments on pericopal lessons. Unlike the old parish priest who preceded them, but like the former university lecturer whom they emulated, the new parsons preached through an entire book of the Bible, chapter by chapter, phrase by phrase, omitting nothing. The kind of thorough exegesis that had been limited in medieval scholasticism to a clerical elite was now offered on a somewhat more elementary level by Calvin to all the faithful. The Calvinist ideal was to place a learned glossator in every pulpit. The local parish became less a sacred space for the celebration of religious mysteries than an assembly room for the theological education of the laity. Historians should not be surprised that the pastor in Reformed churches was often known as a teaching elder. Teaching became a central function of the parish minister in a church that was both mother and school ([Location 6165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6165))
- In short, the relationship of Calvin to scholasticism is a good deal more complicated than we might first have thought. If we raise only the limited question of Calvin’s attitude toward scholasticism in the late medieval church, we can say that Calvin despised it, respected it, borrowed from it, misrepresented it, and emulated it. Indeed, his own bipolar theological program of theology and exegesis bore a striking resemblance to the bipolar program of the scholastic theologians. If, however, we focus on Calvin’s understanding of the nature of the church, we find that he regarded it as a school of faith in which all the laity were called to exercise their theological responsibility before God. It could be argued—and I am inclined to argue it—that Calvin’s reconception of theology as a school theology for the church represents a democratization and expansion of the scholastic ideal. The time is therefore overdue for historians and theologians to acknowledge what they can no longer credibly deny, namely, that the phrase “the scholastic Calvin” is not an oxymoron. Even if Calvin was not a scholastic in the sense Duns Scotus was (and there is a sense in which he clearly was not), he was undeniably a scholasticus in another equally important sense, a schoolmaster in the church that he regarded as both mother and school.

- Medieval Christians spoke not of a twofold but a fourfold sense of Scripture: a literal sense and three spiritual senses, each spiritual sense corresponding to one of the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love.8 The allegorical sense corresponded to the virtue of faith. It was devoted to the credenda, the theological sense of Scripture that dealt with matters of belief. The tropological or moral sense corresponded to the virtue of love. It clarified the agenda, the moral duties Christians should discharge. The anagogical sense corresponded to the virtue of hope. It contemplated the speranda, the final ends toward which all Christians should aspire. Ordinarily the literal sense of the Bible could be expected to nurture one or all of the three theological virtues. But when it did not, preachers and theologians could rest in the sure and certain confidence that the seemingly barren text that confronted them could yield edifying fruit, if interpreted allegorically or tropologically or anagogically. ([Location 6336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6336))
- The usual example cited to illustrate the quadriga or fourfold sense was the city of Jerusalem. On the literal level, Jerusalem was a city in Palestine with homes, bazaars, mosques, churches, and remnants of the Second Temple. On the allegorical level, it was the church, radiant in holiness, adorned with saints and martyrs, proclaiming its ancient faith and dispensing its life-giving sacraments. On the tropological level, it was the faithful soul, marked by its trust in divine mercy and devoted to patient works of love. Finally, on the anagogical level it was Jerusalem the Golden, the heavenly city of the Apocalypse, a city not made with hands, which would appear at the end of time.

- Thomas Aquinas, who lectured on several biblical books, including Job, Matthew, Romans, and John, gave a theoretical foundation for the primacy of the literal sense of the Bible when he distinguished the significative power of words from the significative power of things.9 In ordinary human speech words signify things. The word “lion” signifies a large member of the cat family that can be found on the plains of Africa or in a local zoo. But in the Bible the things signified by words may themselves signify other things. Under these conditions “lion,” not the word but the beast itself, may signify other things, such as the Lion of Judah or the devil who rages like a roaring lion. When interpreters deal with the sign-function of words, they are dealing with the literal sense of the biblical text; when they deal with the sign-function of things, they are dealing with its spiritual sense. How this scheme worked in practice is less important for us to consider than the obvious point Thomas was attempting to make, namely, that there is no access to the spiritual sense of the text except through the literal. Even when the letter kills, it is the only entrance to the Spirit who gives life. ([Location 6364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6364))
- Nicholas of Lyra, a Franciscan friar who greatly admired Thomas Aquinas, seized upon the dictum which Thomas repeated that the literal sense of the biblical text is the sense which the author intended. Unlike some theologians, Albert the Great for one, Thomas had in mind not the human author—not Moses or Isaiah or David or Paul—but God, who was the principal author of the Bible. Whatever God intended to say defined for Thomas the boundaries of the literal sense. In response to Thomas, Lyra asked whether God might have intended more than one thing at a time in the same text and concluded that he might. Isaiah 53, the language of which is familiar to anyone who has ever heard Handel’s Messiah, refers in the first instance to ancient Israel, the suffering servant of God. But no medieval Christian could read lines like “Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows” without hearing in them a reference to the sufferings of Jesus Christ. Lyra did not think it necessary to appeal to the spiritual sense of Isaiah 53 to explain the Christian intuition that such lines pointed not only toward Israel, but also toward the passion and death of Jesus of Nazareth.

- In his commentaries on the literal and moral senses of the Bible, Lyra distinguished between a literal-historical and a literal-prophetic sense. The literal-historical sense refers to the immediate historical circumstances in which a text was composed and first understood. In its literal-historical sense Isaiah 53 refers to ancient Israel, surrounded by enemies who despised it. The literal-prophetic sense offers a more or less hidden reference to events and circumstances that have not yet taken place. In its literal-prophetic sense Isaiah 53 refers to Jesus of Nazareth, “despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.” Not every text has a literal-prophetic as well as a literal-historical sense, nor does the distinction between them exclude the possibility of three further spiritual senses, allegorical, tropological, and anagogical. Indeed, it is possible in principle to have all five in one text. The text “The letter kills but the Spirit makes alive” takes on a new resonance in the face of the… ([Location 6381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6381))
- Still, Calvin did make a serious effort to prune what he regarded as allegorical excesses and to concentrate on the literal sense of the text, that is, the story as it presents itself to the common reader. He wanted to find, if possible, the rich range of spiritual meanings inside the letter of the text rather than behind or beyond it. One way to do this was to proceed by analogy. Analogy posits a similarity of circumstance between the characters in the Bible and the persons who live in Calvin’s own world, even while acknowledging the existence of important differences. This similarity may be grounded in part on their common humanity. ([Location 6420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6420))
- One of the most striking characteristics of Luther’s preaching (evident also in his magisterial commentary on Genesis) was his imaginative re-creation and amplification of the biblical stories. He assumed the role of a Greek chorus, briefing the reader on the deep background of the stories, suggesting psychological motivations for the actions of the principal characters, and fitting the elements of the plot into the larger narrative of the unfolding purposes of God. Luther treated the biblical characters like the citizens in Wittenberg who heard him preach, invested with the same anxieties, armed with same common sense. By doing so, he made the past real by making it local. ([Location 6427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6427))
- Although I called this essay “Calvin and the Irrepressible Spirit,” I could as easily have called it “Calvin and the Elusive Letter,” since it is clear that the phrase “the literal sense of the text” is not unambiguous and has meant different things at different times to different authors. Historians who announce that Nicholas of Lyra or Thomas Aquinas stressed the literal sense of Scripture (which, of course, they did) may be asserting something less or something other than they imagine. By the end of the Middle Ages, 2 Cor. 3:6 was widely understood to imply a distinction between the literal-historical sense and four other senses. Biblical interpreters accepted as a theological axiom the proposition that, although the literal-historical sense of Scripture sometimes kills, the Holy Spirit could nevertheless make the Bible alive and life-giving through the literal-prophetic, allegorical, tropological, and/or anagogical senses. ([Location 6506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6506))
- Although Calvin severely limited the use of allegory, he did not think that the letter of Scripture could be so identified with the original setting of a biblical story or oracle that its significance remained limited to and exhausted by the past. In the letter that was also a lively Word of God, the Holy Spirit bound past and present together. The competent expositor could uncover the unity of past and present through the use of analogy, especially analogy grounded in the covenant with Israel and the church, and through the proper interpretation of typology, understood primarily as prophetic foreshadowings of Christ. Calvin’s emphasis on the literal sense of Scripture, while abandoning the medieval quadriga in principle, retained it in fact, especially, what medieval theologians had called the literal-prophetic sense of the biblical text. The literal sense was for Calvin what the allegorical sense had been for Origen, a sensus plenior, a generous, big-bellied letter filled with spiritual significance and unfailingly edifying. It was never reducible to a bare narrative of events. ([Location 6513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0057CZ5IS&location=6513))
- In the light of the history of the interpretation of 2 Cor. 3:6, I would like to propose an alternative hermeneutical principle based on the nature of the Bible as Christian Scripture. The Bible was not written primarily to inform us about the dietary customs of ancient Semitic tribes in the Mediterranean basin or the social organization of the late Roman world, though a good deal of useful information about both of those subjects can be culled from it. The Bible as Christian Scripture (i.e., the Hebrew Bible joined to the New Testament rather than to the Talmud) exists to serve as an instrument of the Holy Spirit to reconcile men and women to God through Jesus Christ in the community of the church. Unless the Bible achieves that goal in the community of the church, it does not realize its own true nature. Given the instrumental character of Scripture and its goal of reconciliation in Christ, it cannot be interpreted solely in its literal or historical sense without violating its deepest nature. The nature of Scripture requires the church to read the biblical text in its literal-historical (including historical-critical), literal-prophetic, allegorical, tropological, and anagogical senses.
