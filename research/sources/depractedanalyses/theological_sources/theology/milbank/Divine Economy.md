### Highlights

- This original event is given completely to and in history and then is diachronically passed on through its non-identical repetition in and through the church. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=64))
- To find God is, of course, from a theological perspective, to discover what is reasonable, what is true, good and beautiful. It is the end to which all other ends point. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=95))
- A central theme of this book is that any theological acceptance of the factvalue, or is-ought, distinction will inevitably de-historicize and departicularize theology, and render it to the margins of social, political, and economic discourse. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=111))
- This distinction, however, did not occur because of some secular conspiracy against Christianity. It was produced within Christianity itself through the work of the theologians who created a two-tiered world where nature could be known without God. Such a self-evident nature gave rise to the modern fact-value distinction. It is now so embedded in our politics and economics that resistance to it can hardly even be recognized. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=114))
- The question assumes a form of rationality, known as ‘marginalism,’ that inevitably reduces all forms of life to ‘utility’ and ‘interest. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=136))
- viewing all human action in terms of ‘opportunity costs.’ In fact, this putatively harmless example contains a complex metaphysics that assumes all human action and language takes place in a tragic world of scarcity. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=137))
- The Anglo-Catholic theologian, John Milbank, presents an explicitly theological development of both MacIntyre’s recovery of virtue and a Catholic notion of economy, understood in terms of ‘complex space.’ His theology gives a central role to theological themes, which the dominant tradition incorporated into its strategy with difficulty—a central role for Christology and ecclesiology. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=178))
- Hans Urs von Balthasar recognized that the modern era had lost the beautiful and with it a significant understanding of the truth. Von Balthasar noted that beauty had been destroyed by ‘interests.’ His theological trilogy reversed the order of Kant’s three critiques by beginning with beauty, proceeding to the good and ending with the true.1 In his Theological Aesthetics he stated: Beauty is the word that shall be our first. Beauty is the last thing which the thinking intellect dares to approach, since only it dances as an uncontained splendour around the double constellation of the true and the good and their inseparable relation to one another. Beauty is the disinterested one, without which the ancient world refused to understand itself, a word which both imperceptibly and yet unmistakably has bid farewell to our new world, a world of interests, leaving it to its own avarice and sadness.2 Without beauty, truth too easily loses its relationship to vision and story. The result is that truth can be conceived only as brute facticity. Interests then predominate, because those facts stand alone and do not exist within a rich world of beauty that gives them their intelligibility. Meaning becomes a volitional activity of human techne: something that is accomplished after the facts have been presented. This should never be satisfying for Christian theology. It proceeds from the gift of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Christ is the form of beauty and all human exchanges are called to participate in that form. ([Location 5209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5209))
- Milbank, like James Cone, regards capitalism as a Christian heresy. ([Location 5224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5224))
- To believe in plenitude is to believe in the already commenced and yet-tocome restoration of Creation as Creation. ([Location 5245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5245))
- MacIntyre wants to argue against this stoic-liberal-nihilist tendency, which is ‘secular reason’. But my case is rather that it is only a mythos and therefore cannot be refuted, but only out-narrated, if we can persuade people—for reasons of ‘literary taste’—that Christianity offers a much better story. ([Location 5254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5254))
- Whereas MacIntyre remains wedded to the power of the good as that which can stand over and against the liberal reduction of the moral life to rights alone, Milbank, drawing upon the theological method of Hans Urs von Balthasar, appeals to beauty. Milbank’s theological aesthetic does not eschew reason, but he is suspicious that the antique virtue to which MacIntyre appeals remains wedded to arguments grounded in conflict, scarcity, and self-possession in such a way that the contents of particular narratives are subordinated to an overarching antagonistic dialectic. ([Location 5257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5257))
- In his definition of a practice MacIntyre states that the excellences involved are cooperative and cannot be scarce. This already moves MacIntyre’s account of virtue away from Aristotle’s self-possessed, great-souled, man and toward Thomas’s disciple, who receives virtues not as a self-possession but as a gift from God’s charitable plenitude mediated through the church’s sacraments. ([Location 5265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5265))
- The central problem Milbank finds with the liberation theologians is their insistence on the autonomy of the social sciences. ([Location 5313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5313))
- As I will show, Milbank finds this abstract right a Christian heresy because it represents a deformation of power relationships between God ([Location 5338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5338))
- Barth, like Milbank, found Kant too dogmatic in asserting what can be known about God. But the theological implications Milbank and Barth draw from this criticism differ markedly. For Barth this meant that theology should eschew analogical language about God and the world altogether. But Milbank suggests that ‘theology must always speak “also” about the creation, and therefore always “also” in the tones of human discourse about being, nature, society, language and so forth.’17 It is this also that Barth would find objectionable. But it is this also that requires Milbank to read economics theologically. Theology has no ‘proper subject matter’ of its own, so it must use analogical speech drawing upon other discourses and fitting them into its own logic. This distances Milbank from Barth. ([Location 5346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5346))
- theology works, but the way through which it must work. Milbank fears that once Barth makes Christ the object rather than the (theo)logic ‘theology will be distinguished only by the specificity of its empirical object, and the question of whether this object can call into question the methods and supposed “objects” of other sciences cannot really arise.’19 Although Barth suggested the possibility ([Location 5364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5364))
- he denies altogether the need to distinguish creation from grace. Milbank asserts, drawing on and extending the work of Henri de Lubac, that ‘there is no gratuity in addition to the gratuity of creation.’21 ([Location 5370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5370))
- This primacy of the church becomes the pattern for economic life and leads Milbank to condemn capitalism as a heresy that celebrates a formal power established in opposition to the divine-human drama. It leads him also to call for the recovery of a pre-1848 Christian socialism. ([Location 5404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5404))
- John Milbank’s theology develops Hans Urs von Balthasar’s theological aesthetics. Balthasar found aesthetics to be the only definitive inroad to the center of theology.26 For him, the formosus, the beautiful, originates from forma, shape, and speciosus, the comely. ([Location 5406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5406))
- The beautiful never exists in the general alone: the beautiful is not merely the Kantian sublime—to think the infinite without contradiction—which becomes a subjective assertion about humanity’s own powers and still assumes two separate spheres between the finite and the infinite. The beautiful exists as the universal in the particular; it is to think the infinite in and through the finite; it may be in the eyes of the beholder but it is what those eyes behold that matters. It must have an objective content, compelling and eliciting our desire. It is to gaze upon Jesus, and all those saints whose lives embody the beauty of Christ. ([Location 5426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5426))

- Neither the true nor the good alone can adequately convey the Christian revelation: for that, the beautiful also is required. ([Location 5433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5433))

- Because our cultural products confront us and are not truly ‘in our control’ or even ‘our gift’, this allows that somewhere among them God of his own free will finds the space to confront us also. The transcendental possibility of revelation is the decision of God to create the poetic being humankind, and with this realization one can, at once, overcome a liberal, merely ‘ethical,’ reading of religion, and also an (equally modern and deviant) positivistic notion of revelation as something in history ‘other’ to the normal processes of historicity. The event of revelation itself may be defined as the intersection of the divine and human creations. ([Location 5435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5435))

- Although he has been influenced by von Balthasar’s theological aesthetics, Milbank does appear to eviscerate Jesus of any substantial content. The key to Christology is not the substance of Jesus in his two natures but the practice he initiates, which then becomes repeated as church. ([Location 5443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5443))
- For Milbank, the heart of the Gospel is not ‘the story of Jesus and how he wrought human salvation’: it is ‘the (re)foundation of a new community.’38 It is the establishment of an ongoing practice of nonidentically repeating the gift of Jesus through the church. Otherwise the incarnation and death of Jesus become isolatable data to be believed separately from the meta-narrative that makes them significant. ([Location 5463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5463))
- If the primacy of ecclesiology (the refoundation of a new community) is maintained, then the incarnation and atonement can maintain their rich significance through the repetition of the historical creation of this new community. ([Location 5467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5467))
- Thus, says Milbank, the historical concreteness of Jesus is forever buried beneath—although at the same time preserved within—an avalanche of metaphors and typological stories which themselves tend in the direction of spelling out the mere formal grammar of the ‘fact’ of incarnation…. [The] ‘textual’ Christ, who has always been the Christ who saves us, is the real historical ‘person’ Jesus, for ‘real’ human identity resides in its ‘force’ or the effect upon others made by an individual. ([Location 5477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5477))
- But in this he follows Thomas, who argued that what Jesus instituted was not a new teaching per se, for what he taught was already present in the ten commandments. What Jesus institutes is a new community to promulgate this teaching, and his own vision and presence, to sustain it. We then participate in it through our own poetic activity. ([Location 5497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5497))

- For Milbank, Jesus does not represent an identifiable telos toward which we are moving in such a way that the present (and the past) are rendered merely transitory phases of becoming. Instead Christianity embodies a ‘telos which subverts teleology’ because ‘no aspect of life is merely a stage on the way to a final outcome.’ And this means that the church has less definite ideas about the roles and characters it seeks to produce than does the polis. As Milbank puts it, ‘what must be done again is nothing specific and definable…but…a work of continuous judgment.’ ([Location 5499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5499))
- Nietzsche, whom Milbank recognizes is a ‘remote and bastard descendant of Luther.’ Nietzsche’s reactive notion of virtue resembles the Lutheran doctrine of simul Justus et peccator taken to an extreme. If taken seriously, holiness will no longer be present. Instead delight will be taken in the fact that no infallible performance of goodness is possible. ([Location 5525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5525))
- This new politics first of all ensured that men, when enjoying unrestricted, unimpeded property rights and even more when exercising the rights of a sovereignty that ‘cannot bind itself’, come closest to the imago dei. Secondly, by abandoning participation in Being and Unity for a ‘covenantal bond’ between God and men, it provided a model for human interrelationships as ‘contractual’ ones. ([Location 5614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5614))
- Milbank finds a contractual economy problematic because it assumes a process of exchange which is not based on gift but merely on will. In modern contractual economies, my labor is an investment that goes out from me and is then alienated: it represents a sacrifice made by my will. It becomes a commodity that receives a return only in the form of abstract equivalence such as wages. ([Location 5618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5618))
- There is no place for a sacrificial economy within Christian theology: ‘a self-sacrificial view of morality is first immoral, second, impossible and third, a deformation, not the fulfillment of the Christian gospel.’60 The very idea that Christian love requires disinterested concern for the other, as Reinhold Niebuhr and Max Stackhouse have taught us, is for Milbank a Christian deformation, a misunderstanding of the necessary relationship between agape and eros. And it is the basis for a contractual understanding of exchange based on alienation and substitution. ([Location 5622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5622))

- This is how the divine economy itself works—as ‘inexorable gift and infinite return.’ God on the cross receives our refusal of being, so manifesting the refusal as, after all, the reception of a gift. ([Location 5628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5628))
- For Milbank, the divine economy, with its basis in gift, must be represented in our lives because our lives are also fundamentally based on exchange. We have no alternative to exchange: there is no self-sacrificial morality that gives without expecting a return; no heroic sacrifice that is redemptive in itself. Such an understanding of morality would be inhuman, not even fit for God. ([Location 5632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5632))
- presence. Natural laws alone will not provide its basis. Instead a theological poetics must seek to make possible a participation in daily labor and necessary exchanges as an aesthetic and liturgical offering, as an encounter with God. This ‘supernatural pragmatics’ demands that Christians work for the abolition of capitalism and the recovery of a Christian socialism destroyed by Marx and Engels’ scientific socialism. ([Location 5646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5646))
- theology works, but the way through which it must work. Milbank fears that once Barth makes Christ the object rather than the (theo)logic 'theology will be distinguished only by the specificity of its empirical object, and the question of whether this object can call into question the methods and supposed "objects" of other sciences cannot really arise.'19 Although Barth suggested the possibility ([Location 5876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5876))
- he denies altogether the need to distinguish creation from grace. Milbank asserts, drawing on and extending the work of Henri de Lubac, that 'there is no gratuity in addition to the gratuity of creation.'21 ([Location 5882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FBFGXK&location=5882))
