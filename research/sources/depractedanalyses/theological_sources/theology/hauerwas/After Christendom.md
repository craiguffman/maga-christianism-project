### Highlights

- this strategy turned Christianity into a set of beliefs to legitimate the false universalism of liberalism. In this book I challenge that strategy by reasserting the significance of the church as the embodiment of the necessary practices to sustain Christian affirmation of God as Trinity.

- I am not asking the church to withdraw, but rather to give up the presumptions of Constantinian power, particularly when those take the form of liberal universalism. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=250))
- simply do not believe that theology can be done as if our social and political considerations are an afterthought. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=258))
- What I do hope, however, comes through is my unrelieved excitement at what a wonderful thing it is to find one's self possessed by God and God's kingdom. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=288))
- Yet I am not convinced that freedom of religion has been good for church or society in America. It has tempted Christians in America to think that democracy is fundamentally neutral and, perhaps, even friendly toward the church. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=934))
- As a result, Christians in America have failed in our responsibility to this state by domesticating the gospel in the hopes of controlling, if not dominating, the ethos of this society. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=939))
- the First Amendment, when interpreted against the backdrop of political liberalism, has had disastrous results for church and society. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=941))
- am not suggesting we repeal the First Amendment. The First Amendment could be a politically significant way for a state to acknowledge those public enterprises so essential to the public weal that they should be protected from command of the government. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=943))
- my concern is not with the failure of American society in this respect, but with the failure of the church to hold this society to be true to its own best commitments. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=945))
- We thus fail to remember that the question is not whether the church has the freedom to preach the gospel in America, but rather whether the church in America preaches the gospel as truth. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=950))
- The question is not whether we have freedom of religion and a corresponding limited state in America, but whether we have a church that has a people capable of saying no to the state. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=951))

- No state, particularly the democratic state, is kept limited by constitutions, but rather states are limited by a people with the imagination and courage to challenge the inveterate temptation of the state to ask us to compromise our loyalty to God. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=952))
- Freedom of religion is a temptation, albeit a subtle one. It tempts us as Christians to believe that we have been rendered safe by legal mechanisms. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=954))
- We thus become tolerant, allowing our convictions to be relegated to the realm of the private. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=958))
- Rather, the church was subverted by being asked to support society by making the gospel a civil religion in which the church, ironically, can only be politically irrelevant. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AKJZ9IY&location=962))
