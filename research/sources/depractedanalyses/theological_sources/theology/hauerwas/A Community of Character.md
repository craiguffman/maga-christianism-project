- All I mean by secular is that our polity and politics gives no special status to any recognizable religious group.3 Correlatively such a policy requires that public policies be justified on grounds that are not explicitly religious.

- Most recent Christian social ethics in America has thus derived from the largely unexamined axiom that Christians should engage in politics to secure a more nearly just society. Following the lead of the social gospel, social ethics presumes that the task of Christians is to transform5 our basic social and economic structures in order to aid individuals in need. Thus political involvement is seen to be the best mechanism to deal with, and perhaps even transform, structures of injustice.

- In the interest of securing more equitable forms of justice possible in our society, Christians have failed to challenge the moral presuppositions of our polity and society. Nowhere is the effect of this seen more powerfully than in the Christian acquiescence to the liberal assumption that a just polity is possible without the people being just.7 We simply accepted the assumption that politics is about the distribution of desires, irrespective of the content of those desires, and any consideration of the development of virtuous people as a political issue seems an inexcusable intrusion into our personal liberty.

- Indeed, only if such people exist is it possible for the state to be “secular.” Because the church rarely now engenders such a people and community, it has failed our particular secular polity: Christians have lacked the power that would enable themselves and others to perceive and interpret the kind of society in which we ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYO0&location=1637))

- Christians must again understand that their first task is not to make the world better or more just, but to recognize what the world8 is and why it is that it understands the political task as it does. The first social task of the church is to provide the space and time necessary for developing skills of interpretation and discrimination sufficient to help us recognize the possibilities and limits of our society.

- Theologically, the challenge of Christian social ethics in our secular polity is no different than in any time or place—it is always the Christian social task to form a society that is built on truth rather than fear. For the Christian, therefore, the church is always the primary polity through which we gain the experience to negotiate and make positive contributions to whatever society in which we may find ourselves.

- We thus feel puzzled by critiques of our society such as that of Solzhenitsyn. For it is the brunt of his charge that a polity is ultimately judged by the kind of people it produces, and from such a perspective our society can only be found wanting.

- Yet to dismiss Solzhenitsyn in this way is but to manifest the problem he is trying to point out. For we have assumed that we can form a polity that ignores the relation between politics and moral virtue. In contrast, Solzhenitsyn takes the classical view that it should be the function of politics to direct people individually and collectively toward the good.

- In effect he is suggesting that when freedom becomes an end in itself people lose their ability to make sacrifices for worthy ends. The problem with our society is not that democracy has not worked, but that it has, and the results are less than good.13 We have been freed to pursue happiness and “every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the achievement of happiness. In the process, however, one psychological detail has been overlooked: the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many Western faces with worry and even depression, though it is customary to conceal such feelings. Active and tense competition permeates all human thoughts without opening a way to free spiritual development.” ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYO0&location=1670))

- one of the great ironies of our society is that by attempting to make freedom an end in itself we have become an excessively legalistic society. As Solzhenitsyn points out, we feel there is little need for voluntary self-restraint, as we are free to operate to the limit of the law. Thus in condemning Richard Nixon, virtues of decency and honesty were invoked, but the legal system offered the only code by which the unacceptableness of those actions could be clearly and cogently expressed.

- That our society has been brought to such a pass is no surprise to Solzhenitsyn, as he thinks it is the inevitable result of a social order whose base is the humanism of the Enlightenment, which presupposed that intrinsic evil did not exist, nor did man have any higher task than the attainment of his own happiness. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYO0&location=1695))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- But such presumptions are profoundly false and any politics founded on them can only lead men to destruction, for if humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy, he would not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to die, his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature. It cannot be unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life. It cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most out of them. It has to be the fulfillment of a permanent, earnest duty so that one’s life journey may become an experience of moral growth, so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it.

- Solzhenitsyn seems not to realize that our society’s commitment to “religious freedom” is based exactly on the understanding that the church will not challenge the primary assumption of our system. The very materialism and banality of American life that Solzhenitsyn condemns is the price, and not a high price at that, we must pay in order to make the state neutral in matters moral and religious.

- Liberalism is successful exactly because it supplies us with a myth that seems to make sense of our social origins. For there is some truth to the fact that we originally existed as a people without any shared history, but came with many different kinds of histories. In the absence of any shared history we seemed to lack anything in common that could serve as a basis for societal cooperation. Fortunately, liberalism provided a philosophical account of society designed to deal with exactly that problem: A people do not need a shared history; all they need is a system of rules that will constitute procedures for resolving disputes as they pursue their various interests.… ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYO0&location=1729))

- In America we rely on diverse ways to obtain blood, ranging from voluntary programs to buying it. We feel that our system is inherently superior to the British because we do not prevent anyone from giving or selling their blood. We have a choice and are therefore free. What we fail to notice is that by giving a “choice” we also create the assumption that blood, like cars and toothbrushes, can be bought and sold. We thus ignore the fact that the choice of selling blood trains us to see blood as simply one commodity among others.

- Put differently, what we have overlooked is that social policies should not only be efficient and fair, but they should also train us to have certain virtues as citizens.

- But the human costs of distrust are perhaps the most destructive. For we are increasingly forced to view one another as strangers rather than as friends, and as a result we become all the more lonely.

- Or, for example, Milton Friedman, the paradigm liberal whom we mistakenly call “conservative,” claims that for liberals “freedom of the individual or perhaps the family, is our ultimate goal in judging social arrangements. In a society freedom has nothing to say about what an individual does with his freedom; it is not an all-embracing ethic. Indeed, a major aim of the liberal is to leave the ethical problem for the individual to wrestle with.”30 But Friedman fails to recognize that the kind of freedom gained by the individual in our society is incompatible with freedom of the family. A society that leaves the “ethical problem to the individual” cannot engender or sustain the virtues necessary for providing the individual or the family the power to resist the state.

- liberalism’s embrace of the market as the dominant institution of society involved a fundamental change in the conception of human nature. The traditional view of man was that of a being whose activity was an end in itself. With the rise of the market society the essence of rational purpose was taken to be the pursuit of possessions—we are what we own. But as soon as you take the essence of man to be the acquisition of more things for himself, as soon as you make the essential human quality the striving for possessions rather than creative activity, you are caught up in an insoluble contradiction. Human beings are sufficiently unequal in strength and skill that if you put them into an unlimited contest for possessions, some will not only get more than others, but will get control of the means of labor to which the others must have access. The others then cannot be fully human even in the restricted sense of being able to get possessions, let alone in the original sense of being able to use their faculties in purposive creative activity. So in choosing to make the essence of man the striving for possessions, we make it impossible for many men to be fully human.

- No matter how great our abundance, we assume it is necessary to make and want more, even if the acquisition of more requires the unjust exploitation of “less developed lands.” In truth we have no choice, for in a social order where distrust is primary we can only rely on abundance and technology to be a substitute for cooperation and community.

- testimony to the moral limits of the liberal tradition. For the “original position” is a stark metaphor for the ahistorical approach of liberal theory, as the self is alienated from its history and simply left with its individual preferences and prejudices.34 The “justice” that results from the bargaining game is but the guarantee that my liberty to consume will be fairly limited within the overall distributive shares. To be sure, some concern for the “most disadvantaged” is built into the system, but not in a manner that qualifies my appropriate concern for my self-interest. Missing entirely from Rawls’ position is any suggestion that a theory of justice is ultimately dependent on a view of the good; or that justice is as much a category for individuals as for societies.

- In an effort to rid liberalism of a social system built on envy, Rawls has to resort to the extraordinary device of making all desires equal before the bar of justice.

- The challenge of the political today is no different than it has always been, though it appears in a new form. The challenge is always for the church to be a “contrast model” for all polities that know not God. Unlike them, we know that the story of God is the truthful account of our existence, and thus we can be a community formed on trust rather than distrust. The hallmark of such a community, unlike the power of the nation-states, is its refusal to resort to violence to secure its own existence or to insure internal obedience. For as a community convinced of the truth, we refuse to trust any other power to compel than the truth itself.
