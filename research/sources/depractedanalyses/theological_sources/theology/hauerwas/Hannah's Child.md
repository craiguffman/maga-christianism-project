### Highlights

- theology is a discipline whose subject should always put in doubt the very idea that those who practice it know what they are doing. ([Location 13](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=13))
    - **Note:** Stanley Hauerwas, from his memoir, Hannah's Child.
- I do not put much stock in "believing in God." The grammar of "belief" invites a far too rationalistic account of what it means to be a Christian. "Belief" implies propositions about which you get to make up your mind before you know the work they are meant to do. ([Location 23](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=23))
- It is notthat I lack faith, but that I always have the sense that I am such a beginner when it comes to knowing how to be a Christian. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=37))
- When I first read Kierkegaard, I was quite taken with his suggestion that the "what" of Christianity is not the problem. It is the "how." ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=39))
- In contrast to an autobiography, Birkerts suggests, memoir is not a sequenced account of a life but the telling of the stories that have given a life its internal shape. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=46))
- It was never clear to me why we needed to be revived, but you could always count on some members of the church, and they were often the same people year after year, being saved. I sometimes think they wanted to be saved in order to save the preacher, because it was assumed that the Word had not been rightly preached if no one was saved. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=81))
- John's argument was an elaboration of Cushman's account of Plato: knowledge, in this case of God, requires a lifelong transformation of the self. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=196))
- Rather, I slowly learned by his example that to be a Christian meant that you could never protect yourself from the truth. John loved Nietzsche because he admired Nietzsche's ability to get to the heart of the matter. John was a Texan;he had little use for bullshit. Some, I suspect, would have confused his ability to call it like he saw it with cynicism, but he was not a cynic. He was not a cynic because, like Nietzsche, he had a passion for the truth. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=215))
- Intellectually, my greatest strength is that there is nothing in which I am not interested. Intellectually, my greatest weakness is that there is nothing in which I am not interested. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=218))
- I have never known how to negotiate women. That I use those terms suggests how frightened I am of women. Do women need to be "negotiated"? I hope not, but I am never sure I know what women want. I think I need to know what women want because I was raised to think that my job as a male is to give women what they want. I am sure I learned that lesson from my mother. I have always assumed that my task is to make the world all right for any woman who is kind enough to love me. Paternalistic scripts die hard in the souls of Southern males. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=263))
- Liberalism toooften is the attempt to have concrete replace stone in an effort to avoid the necessary existence of a people with wisdom. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=569))
- I think of theology as a craft requiring years of training. Like stonecutters and bricklayers, theologians must come to terms with the material upon which they work. In particular, they must learn to respect the simple complexity of the language of the faith, so that they might reflect the radical character of orthodoxy. I think one of the reasons I was never drawn to liberal Protestant theology was that it felt too much like an attempt to avoid the training required of apprentices. In contrast, Karl Barth's work represented for me an uncompromising demand to submit to a master bricklayer, with the hope that in the process one might learn some of the "tricks of the trade." ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=573))
- I assumed that my parents would never want me to be anything other than straightforward. Bullshit was not allowed. Plain speech and plain thinking was the hallmark of their life, and I took it to be the hallmark of my life. I should like to think that this is still true of how I think and write. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=679))
- I am often asked how I get done all I get done. The answer is simple - I work. I get up at five every morning and I work till six every evening. I do not waste time. If I have fifteen minutes, I can read this or that. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=685))
- the doctrine of creation is necessarily an eschatological doctrine; that is, we know there was a beginning because we have seen the end in Christ. Creation is not "back there." Rather, it names the character of all divine action. God does not need to "intervene" in creation because creation is charged with the grandeur of Christ. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=776))
- I was beginning to understand why Aquinas was right that only God is pure act. Only in God are existence and essence one. Accordingly, our language about God is necessarily analogical, which means that theology has the task of helping the church not say more about God than needs to be said. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=779))
- I was sure Kierkegaard was right to put the stress on the "how" of the faith as necessary for understanding the "what." Put differently, I was learning from Holmer's account of Kierkegaard (as well as from Hartt) that theology is best understood as a form of practical reason. Moreover, I learned from Kierkegaard that the truth of practical reason is Christ, and thus practical reason cannot be constrained by the accommodated form of the church identified with Christendom. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=790))
- From Kierkegaard we learn that the God who is the "infinite qualitative difference" from us has said "yes" to us in Christ. Barth, however, thinks it best that we enter Kierkegaard's school only "once," because the very character of Kierkegaard's attack on the human-centered pietism of his day had the ironic effect of fortifying a quite similar pietism in ours. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=793))
- I lost interest in whether I was or was not a Christian. I simply found what I was reading to be about matters that mattered. This is what I wanted to do with my life. This is what I hope my life has been. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=803))
- I had decided that theology was best done as a form of practical reason. Of course metaphysical issues were constitutive of theological claims, but such issues were best approached indirectly. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=858))
    - **Note:** Hauerwas seems to explain here why he doesn't deal with first principles as Hooker does. It has to do with his perspective of reasoning from analogy per Aquinas. Humility demands we claim the least possible about God.
- under the influence of Collingwood I had become increasingly suspicious of Niebuhr's attempt to distinguish an outer history of things from an inner history of selves. I worried that this distinction might be problematic for the actual practice of history, and I was also beginning to think that it might have unhappy Christological implications. In many ways, everything I have done subsequently has been a continuation of that set of issues. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=862))
- I remember, however, being disappointed in the conclusion of the book, where Jesus seems to do no more than confirm what we might know on other grounds. I began to wonder if Jim thought thatJesus was but the exemplification of what it means to trust that we can trust in trust. I sensed that he, like H. Richard… ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=870))

- I saw that the liberal emphases on the life of Jesus could be interpreted as the rightful refusal to let go of the life of Jesus. Both more "orthodox" Christologies and the Protestant emphasis on justification seemed to give in to the temptation to leave Jesus behind. I think I wrote a paper on H. Richard Niebuhr's Christologyin which I argued… ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=927))
- Mr. Gustafson was kind enough to give me a reading course in which I again read Aristotle and Aquinas on the virtues. Character and the Christian Life grew out of that reading course. That may not quite be true. Character and the Christian Life grew out of everything I had been doing, but Mr. Gustafson's course certainly helped me focus what I needed to do to write my dissertation. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1005))
- the primary task of my work even then was to demonstrate the link between the truth of what we say we believe and the shape of the lives we live. "Ethics" has always been my way to pursue that task. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1020))
- our task was to give the parents the impression that by sending their daughters to Augustana they would not lose the virginity they had already lost in high school. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1124))
- I have spent a lifetime being misunderstood by people who think they know what I think, given what they think, but in fact I am trying to change how they think. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1137))
- I am deeply grateful for what I learned from him, and from his brother H. Richard. But I think I rightly came to see that there are profound limits, both theologically and politically, to the Niebuhrs. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1167))
- Christianity is the ongoing training necessary to see that we are not fated. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1228))
- Niebuhr had seduced me - and "seduction" is exactly the right word - to assume that the way things are is the way things have to be. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1236))
- Yet somehow I began to write. It did not occur to me that I needed blocks of time to write. Give me thirty minutes here or there, and I could get something done. I am often asked how I have written so much. That is how. I write like I learned to lay brick. You do it because you have to get it done before it rains. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1255))
- Those early essays are still at the heart of the way I have tried to think over the years. If you want to understand me, those are the essays with which you should start. I have learned much since I wrote those essays, but I could not have done so without what Murdoch, Kovesi, and McCabe taught me. No doubt Alasdair Maclntyre became increasingly important, but I am sure I was able to read him more intelligently because of the work I had done with Murdoch, Kovesi, and McCabe. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1257))

- increasingly I have come to believe that "believing in God" is not a description that helps us know much about what it means to be Christian. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1271))
- Of all the people I met in the basement of the library, none proved to be more important than David Burrell, ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1461))
- David, deeply influenced by Wittgenstein and Heidegger, sought to provide a rereading of Thomas's account of analogy by suggesting how the language we use is our best resource for thinking about issues identified as metaphysical. He argued, contrary to the received view, that Thomas had no theory of analogy. He therefore sought to distinguish Thomas from Duns Scotus and Cajetan by drawing on J. L. Austin's performative account of language. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1466))
- I was part of an exciting intellectual adventure that might avoid the sterile "liberal" and "conservative" alternatives that seemed to shape the theological world. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1557))
- I came to appreciate Nick Lash's judgment that the modernists were on the whole right, but by the time that was recognized the issues that concentrated their attention were no longer the issues that mattered.

- So I soon found myself teaching a graduate level course in which we read Aristotle, Thomas, Kant, and Barth - in a semester. It was a great course and some terrific dissertations, such as Paul Wadell's Charity as Friendship with God and Form of the Virtues, were the result; ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1569))
- Reading Maria Montessori's books, moreover, was a real eye opener for me because her "method" seemed to suggest that we learn to think with our hands. Though she had never read Wittgenstein, her educational philosophy could well be understood as drawing out some of the implications of Wittgenstein' s understanding of the bodily character of language.

- medicine was facing a moral crisis. The crisis was not that associated with the increasing technological sophistication of medicine, but rather with whether we as a society had the moral presuppositions and practices to sustain medicine as a practice of presence to the ill. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1640))
- doctors treat patients - not diseases. Moreover, every patient is different, requiring doctors to attend to the concrete particular. It occurred to me that the way we train doctors might be a model formoral training. I have often wished that we could train those going into the ministry not unlike how doctors are trained. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1645))
- Too often it is assumed that medical ethics is, or should be, primarily about what doctors do. But far more important is what kind of people we should be to be patient patients.

- I hope my work in a book like Naming the Silences exemplifies what I can describe only as the importance of having a novelist's eye.

- I was beginning to develop a different way of "doing" ethics. I had learned from Wittgenstein and Kovesi that description is everything. But to sustain truthful descriptions requires agents habituated by the virtues necessary to avoid the lies unleashed by our desire to avoid suffering the suffering of others.

- Moreover, many of these lectures became essays that I eventually collected into books. Increasingly, I found myself writing in response to an invitation to give a lecture on some specific topic.

- To learn to see the world and ourselves through the eyes of the gospel makes the world profoundly comic. Put differently, if you are a Christian, you have nothing to lose, so you might as well tell the truth. Such a truth often surprises and delights us.

- What many people find hard to understand, or at least what strikes them as unusual, is how I combine what I hope is a profound commitment to fundamental Christian convictions with a socially radical ethic. At bottom, the convictions involve the claim that Jesus is both fully God and fully human. If he is not fully both, then we Christians are clearly idolaters. A socially radical ethic follows from this theological conviction because our worship of Jesus is itself a politics through which a world is created that would not exist if Jesus were not… ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=1942))

- What I had discovered in my teaching and writing at Notre Dame is the difference it makes when you refuse to ignore the eschatological character of the gospel, a discovery that Barth made in the second edition of his commentary on Romans and that Yoder made as he wrote pamphlets for display in the back of Mennonite churches. Barth's discovery, bound as it was by the possibilities of European Christianity in 1921, awaited and required rediscovery.

- The board discussed the motion quite favorably. John had worked for years to reach this moment. I then suggested that we vote. At that moment, John, who had been quiet during our discussion, suddenly declared, "You will not vote on this issue." I thought he had gone honkers. This is what he wanted. He explained, however, that the Eucharist is about the unity of the church. If a majority vote determined the matter, then that unity would be betrayed. He noted that some people in the church might not be ready to make this move. He would call a meeting, inviting those who might have reservations to come and express their worries about moving to Eucharist every Sunday. If they strongly dissented, we would have to wait.

- He also taught me how Protestant interpretations of the Old Testament were shaped by anti-Catholic polemics - that is, Protestants turned Second Temple Judaism into priest-ridden legalism so that Jesus could be Luther.

- My best advice for those who find that they must learn to live with someone who is seriously mentally ill is that their first duty is to survive. If you do not survive, no one will survive. Trying to survive is not selfish. You must strive to survive if you are to sustain any hope that life can go on. ([Location 2157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2157))
- the emphasis on narrative is not an invitation to use whatever we take to be our "experience"to test or determine the meaning of the language of the faith. Rather, claims for the significance of narrative entail a robust set of metaphysical claims required by our conviction that God creates ex nihilo. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2236))
- I had argued in The Peaceable Kingdom that the stress on narrative was not only an observation about the significance of stories for determining our lives, but also a robust metaphysical claim. Stories are important, but that our lives can be and finally must be narrated is a confirmation, a witness, to the contingent character of all that is. "All that is," of course, is a metaphysical expression suggesting the unavoidability of separating claims about how we best live from an understanding of the way things are.

- In Preface to Theology, John Yoder comments on attempts to distinguish between the kernel and husk of the gospel in order to avoid eschatological claims at the heart of the New Testament. Yoder observes that if all the New Testament means when it speaks of the New Jerusalem is that "God is love," then we do not have anything to say that the world has not already heard. Yoder describes a number of variations on this theme to suggest that the problem with generalizations that attempt to avoid the eschatological character of God's purposes in history is that the gospel so understood has… ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2247))
- In the Bible, Yoder argues, the eternal is not atemporal. Rather, in the Bible the eternal, in Yoder's words, "is not less like time, but more like time. It is like time to a higher degree. The kingdom is not immaterial, but is more like reality than reality is." Yoder argues that if cross and resurrection are real events, then the fulfillment and culmination of God's purposes must be really historic. The God of the Bible is therefore not timeless. Just as Origen and Tertullian insisted that the Logos was with God from eternity, so we cannot conceive of an atemporal God. We can conceive of a hypertemporal God, that is, a God who is more temporal than we are, "who… ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2252))
- My claim, so offensive to some, that the first task of the church is to make the world the world, not to make the world more just, is a correlative of this theological metaphysics. The world simply cannot be narrated - the world cannot have a story - unless a people exist who make the world the world. That is an eschatological claim that presupposes we know there was a beginning only because we have seen the end. That something had to start it all is not what Christians mean by creation. Creation is not "back there," though there is a "back there" character to creation. Rather, creation… ([Location 2256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2256))

- What so often makes us liars is not what we do, but the justifications we offer for what we do. Our justifications become the way we try to defeat the contingencies of our lives by telling ourselves consoling stories that suggest we have done as well as was possible.

- Being Christian means that I must try to make sense of my life in the light of the gospel, and so I do not get to determine the truthfulness of my story. Rather, those who live according to the gospel will be the ones to determine where I have been truthful and where I have deceived myself. ([Location 2269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2269))
- "In the light of the gospel" names for me the discovery that my life depends on learning to worship God. The worship of God does not come naturally to me, as it seems to for some. I live most of my life as if God does not exist. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2271))
- Through worship, the world learns the truth that is required for our being truthful about ourselves and one another. ([Location 2274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003AIL3X2&location=2274))
- I hesitate to put the question of truth in terms of "beliefs." I have come to think that the challenge confronting Christians is not that we do not believe what we say, though that can be a problem, but that what we say we believe does not seem to make any difference for either the church or the world. Stated differently, my early concerns about the truth of Christian convictions were political - not epistemological. Once I realized this, I began to emphasize the necessity of the church's materialityas the precondition for being able to articulate the difference God makes for knowing the way things are.

- I probably did not make clear that at least some developments identified later as Constantinian can be understood as attempts to instantiate the politics of Jesus. However, insofar as such attempts failed, they exposed the deepest problem with Constantinianism: in the name of being politically responsible, the church became politically invisible.

- It is as an attempt to remedy this invisibility that my work began to unfold. Ironically, Christians had created a politics that identified what it meant to be Christian with the holding of certain "beliefs" that were then described as "private." Under Yoder's influence, I came to understand that the politics of Jesus was a public affair, with cosmic consequences.

- If anything, what I have learned over the years as a Christian theologian is that none of us should try to answer such questions.

- I do think I was writing autobiographically when I wrote Naming the Silences: God, Medicine, and the Problem of Suffering. The argument of that book against theodicies was hard learned. When Christianity is assumed to be an "answer" that makes the world intelligible, it reflects an accommodated church committed to assuring Christians that the way things are is the way things have to be.

- For me, learning to be a Christian has meant learning to live withoutanswers. Indeed, to learn to live in this way is what makes being a Christian so wonderful. Faith is but a name for learning how to go on without knowing the answers. That is to put the matter too simply, but at least such a claim might suggest why I find that being a Christian makes life so damned interesting.
