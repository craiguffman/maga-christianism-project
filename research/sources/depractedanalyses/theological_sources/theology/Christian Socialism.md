### Highlights

- Milbank and the Christian Socialists provide an account of social cooperation that makes possible the creation of social bonds through many levels of social exchange. To be sure the development of such bonds can result in hierarchies that tempt one to a top-down social strategy, but it can equally make possible a pluralism that can act as a check on nationalism. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=85))
- Such a reading, Bretherton suggests, is always tempted to make nation or church rather than Jesus Christ the center and subject of history. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=89))
- There were exceptions, of course, but the response of the Christian Socialists had as its aim not institutional reform but reform of the religious and moral foundations of the nation and of the role of the church in restoring those foundations. They were interested in foundational ideals from which they believed would spring a renewed national life. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=131))
- For the Christian Socialists, socialism meant something entirely different. It meant challenging the individualistic and competitive view of human nature and social life that provided a basis for political economy and for that view substituting another that saw human nature as essentially social and human society as essentially cooperative. When the Christian Socialists spoke of socialism they did not refer to state control of the economy. They spoke of cooperative efforts to improve social relations in ways that produce human flourishing and harmony.

- The Christian Socialists believed the ground from which greed grew was a mistaken conception of human nature and human society. To their minds, the ills of society were caused by a false individualism that exalted competition and denied the social and cooperative nature of human ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=147))

- As a result of this false account of human nature and society, people tended to place rights before duties. The result of this reversal of proper moral order, they held, was an incessant struggle to establish the rights of contending individuals and social groups.

- Their diagnosis of the sickness was individualism, competition, and greed. Their prescription for a cure was reestablishment of the social and cooperative nature of human beings, the priority of duties over rights, and the inculcation of the ideals suggested by the life of Jesus and the social/cooperative nature of humankind. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=151))
- of primary importance to them were community, love, equality, fellowship, duty, service, personality, character, freedom, and property. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=154))
- according to the Christian Socialists, the very purpose of social life is the nurture of “persons” (human beings with a fully formed personality) who develop as they should and have sufficient freedom and means to undertake such a journey. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=156))
- In the nineteenth century, Evangelicals were the dominant force in the Church of England. They did hold poor relief to be a primary Christian duty. Nevertheless, their focus was on the state of individual souls rather than the general state of society. In his seminal work The Kingdom of Christ, F. D. Maurice provided an alternative perspective. His focus switched from the atoning sacrifice of the cross to the incarnation of God in Christ. He argued that by becoming fully human God showed his concern and care for all aspects of human life. Further, by entering fully into the life of the world, God established his dominion over all people, whether they acknowledge that fact or not. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=163))
- The voice of the Christian Socialists echoes throughout the works of Rowan Williams and John Milbank. Each in his own way has immersed himself in this tradition, and each in his own way has carried it forward and developed it. They have addressed both liberals and conservatives out of this tradition and, in so doing, pressed them to take a close look at the state of their society and the character of their common life. They have also offered an alternative vision of another form of life that Milbank terms “the postmodern alternative.” ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=178))
- Instead of structural change they sought to convey to the British public a normative view of life in society. Their aim was to educate the public conscience through the articulation of a “Christian Sociology,” a view of life together shaped by what at times they called “ideals” and at others “Christian principles.” ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=217))
- In making their defense of Christian ideals, the Christian Socialists in England had important things to say about the basic moral vocabulary we use to think about and promote what ought to be the political, economic, and social goals of life in society. So, for example, they argued that duties should be given priority over rights, the common good over individual interests, and public over private responsibility for addressing social problems. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=233))
- they are all at one in believing that no stable or healthy industrial or social fabric can be built upon the principle of Individualism, or is consistent with the assertion of an almost unrestricted Right of Private Property. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=242))
- Social and economic change had forced large numbers of people off the land and crowded them into urban slums. Social dislocation was accompanied not only by grinding poverty but also by a high incidence of social insecurity and disorder. The depressed condition of these displaced urban dwellers stood in marked contrast to the huge concentrations of wealth that resulted from inheritance and the profits generated by the age of the machine. As is now the case with the arrival of a digital economy (perhaps the ultimate expression of the machine age), so the arrival of an industrial economy brought with it social disruption and a degree of economic inequality that threatened social stability. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=251))
- the response of the Christian Socialists in England was, with marked exceptions, unlike that of the Fabians in England, the Marxists in Europe, or the socialist followers of Walter Rauschenbusch in America. They sought no social or political revolution. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=258))
- Their aim was to reestablish a society whose foundation rested in Christian belief and practice—a society of ideals that could be offered as a response to the holiness of God made known to the world in and through the incarnation of God in Christ. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=260))
- Was the character of “the poor” fixed by birth and moral state or by social circumstance? As will become clear, this question remained without a satisfactory answer throughout the course of their history, and so it remains to this day. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=318))
- Their chief concern was to fulfill the mission of the Church of England and in so doing provide a moral vision that would prick the conscience of the English people by calling to mind a group of social ideals the Christian Socialists believed would lead the nation to a renewed and markedly Christian vision of its common life. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=325))
- In the industrial cities, by that time, there was “no squire, no parson, no tradition, no community. Instead there was a proletariat. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=335))
- The clergy who served in these parishes found that their neighbors did not lack faith. What they lacked was trust in their pastors and the church they served. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=349))
- First, the people of England had an inadequate understanding of the nature and causes of poverty. Second, they were confronted with changing views of who was responsible for poor relief. Third, the intellectual project of the Christian Socialists, a project that resonated in a positive way with public opinion, nonetheless faced a critical, even hostile intellectual environment associated (sometimes inaccurately) with many of the century’s leading intellects. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=353))
- The collective representations available to the British public (and the Church of England) that referred to those in dire economic straits (the poor) focused on their moral lives rather than on general social conditions (poverty) related to, even generated by, ambient social facts. It is no wonder then that the Christian Socialists, along with the Church of England and most of their fellow citizens, addressed the state of the poor in terms of moral praise or blame rather than in terms of social conditions and social policy. Their available vocabulary and social experience pressed them to think first of moral culpability or rectitude rather than social structure and circumstance. So it was that they referred to the “deserving and undeserving” poor, ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=361))
- Henry Mayhew, the most perceptive chronicler of London’s poor, said that members of every community could be divided into the energetic and the anergetic. Of the latter he said that they were indisposed to work. This “indolent” class he divided between those who cannot work and those who will not work.21 Poverty was always then a possible indicator of one’s moral state. This view is not a thing of the past. It lives on and is a matter of fierce debate to this day. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=368))
- Poor relief centered in the parish church. Further, there was a general understanding that those blessed with riches had a sacred duty to be charitable. Poverty and charity were penetrated with religious meaning. The church was understood to be the instrument both of social amelioration and of spiritual salvation. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=375))
- In prior common usage poverty was taken to refer to the voluntary or involuntary, ignoble poverty of the “lower orders.” Now, however, poverty was coming to be seen by a growing number of people as a natural but unfortunate condition to be alleviated not by the church but by society. Alleviation of this sort on the part of the state became for a growing number the moral measure of a civilization. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=378))
- It is little wonder then that the Christian Socialists struggled over whether the focus of the church and its clergy should be upon the moral state of the poor and the nation or upon policies of government intended to give redress to a social condition. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=387))
- Particular blame is frequently laid at the feet of Adam Smith, whose notion of an “invisible hand” had been mistakenly understood to mean that the market had its own laws of adjustment—laws not to be tampered with by the likes of fallible humans. Study of his ethical writings reveals clearly that Adam Smith did not in fact envision a marketplace devoid of moral guidance. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=402))
- The real culprits of the amoral market were Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo, who broke the relation between the welfare of the nation and that of the lower classes. For them there was no link between individual interest and general interest. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=405))

- In different ways, these ideas, often taken out of context, served to support the idea of a political economy, a system of production and consumption that operates not by moral constraint but by the law of self-interest.

- He argued that sometime in the 1700s England had deserted the moral ideals upon which its society had been built. As a result, industry no longer served its proper “function” or purpose. That purpose is to provide services that are “necessary, useful or beautiful, and thus bring life to body and spirit.”25 However, the changes of the eighteenth century brought an end to the social ideal championed by the Christian Socialists, namely, social institutions and economic activities ought to be related to common moral ends that give them their significance.

- these ideals provided the keystone of the arch of English society and if they were removed, the Christian Socialists feared, social relations would devolve into a jumble of individual rights claims and conflicting private interests. These rights, protected by government, would become the ultimate social reality. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=426))

- Societies such as these Tawney terms “acquisitive societies,” because “their whole tendency and interest and preoccupation is to promote the acquisition of wealth.”28 Acquisitive societies are consequently subject first of all to “irrational” inequalities in wealth. They also become societies torn by “fierce antagonisms” and warlike competition. In such societies only the fit survive, and those who lose out in the competition are soon considered in some way morally reprobate. As Tawney notes in Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, “The most curious feature in the whole discussion . . . was the resolute refusal to admit that society had any responsibility for the causes of distress.” ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=434))

- In our day, political economy has been replaced by neoliberalism, a term first coined by Milton Friedman in his 1951 essay “Neoliberalism and Its Prospects.” As presently employed, “neoliberalism” is a term that takes laissez-faire economics and radicalizes them. The notion of freedom as freedom from constraint is interpreted solely in economic terms. The meaning of the common good is consequently changed beyond all recognition. For neoliberals the common good simply falls out from the free exercise of rational behavior and self-interest on the part of economic agents. The free exercise of rational choice within the market is sort of an invisible hand that works for the benefit of all.

- Now, when the exercise of negative liberty crashes into capital markets, humanity receives a new definition. Human being is defined as a form of capital—by whether one is able to participate in the market either as a self-interested agent or as a speck of human capital. Anyone unable to participate either as a profit-seeking entrepreneur or as a speck of human capital is simply a nonperson. Indeed, all spheres of life are economized. All relations are measured by profit or loss. In all relations we are judged as market actors. Such persons are controlled by their desires and as such are politically manageable. Government can now act on the social environment so as to meet or create desires. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=448))

- As Owen Chadwick has written of them, “They were men of the Reformation, who preached the cross, the depravity of man, and justification by faith alone. Some of them were Calvinists and more of them were not . . . They pondered long and daily over the Bible, were decisive and orthodox Protestants.” He goes on, “They exalted the prayer book, valued the establishment, resented assaults upon a state church . . . Most of them were conservative in politics and wanted the established church to control education.” ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=490))

- Nevertheless, their primary interest was the state of individual souls before God. Duties to the poor to their mind were quite real—linked as they were to concern for both their physical and spiritual wellbeing. Poor relief for them was, however, not properly a matter for government policy but individual practice, linked as it was to evangelistic efforts, the moral reform of individuals, and private acts of charity.

- Maurice laid aside an individualistic account of life with God and in its place proposed a more social one. In his discussion of Methodism in his major work, The Kingdom of Christ, Maurice asks this question: “We have often been obliged to ask ourselves, whether these distinct individual acts, on which Protestantism dwells so excessively, may not, must not, depend at last upon some relation in which men stand to their fellows; whether we can take our start from individuals, and form a society out of them; whether the existence of society be not implied in their existence; and whether, consequently, if each man have a spiritual existence, and be subjected to a spiritual government, there must not be somewhere a spiritual body, of which he should account himself a member?” ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=518))

- They who enter into this state are bound to love their enemies, are bound to love all men, because they see that God loves all; they love those who hate and persecute them, because for these enemies and persecutors Christ died. They love even the enemies of God, because they regard them as creatures still bearing the flesh which Christ bore—not yet finally separated from Him, not deserted by his Spirit. They keep the command given in his Sermon on the Mount strictly, fully, spiritually, for the reason the Lawgiver himself lays down, because they “are the children of their father in heaven.”37 ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=538))

- As aspects of divine providence, the common life of family and nation are, out of love for God and neighbor, to be tended and cared for. In this account of the Christian doctrine of the incarnation, Christian Socialists found a charter for promoting ideals that might lead to changes of heart and so also to a change in the conditions under which their fellow citizens lived.

- Maurice believed that God, in his providence, has provided all peoples with the political and familial institutions that order their common life. Because they are from God, social institutions are to be minded and tended rather than reformed. Maurice wanted to “dig down” below these social arrangements to the moral status and qualities of the people whose lives they ordered. Consequently, he opposed all attempts at social change that were not focused on the moral lives of the citizenry. The way to address the evils of society was not to change its institutions but to change the moral lives of its individual members by drawing them into the fellowship God’s universal love engenders and supports. Maurice’s vision was the harmonious cooperation of each person and each social estate in a way that produces peace, prosperity, and fellowship for all.

- According to Maurice, all people are in Christ, whether they know it or not. Those who do know it are subject to the transformation of their lives by the indwelling Spirit of Christ who transforms lives rooted in self-love into lives rooted in love for God and neighbor. No doubt this personal transformation has transformative consequences in all the dimensions of life. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=563))

- Rather, he sought to “dig down” to the base level of human values and there identify the work of Christ as one that transforms the lives of those who have received him as the ruler of their lives. He did not believe that God intends these transformed lives to be agents of change in the basic structures of society. He believed that God’s intention for them is to be a sort of presence within society that changes the character of relations between people who occupy different positions within a social structure. He thought of Christ more as a transformer of lives and social relations than as a transformer of social order and its defining culture.

- In a letter to Charles Forbes he said this about the French Socialists: “They fancy that society is to be regenerated by an improved social machinery, as if a machine, however perfect, could ever produce any moral good, & were not productive of injury or benefit, exactly in proportion as the hand that moves it is evil or good. That is to say, their Revolution is practically godless . . . They are trying to manufacture a Paradise out of their own theories & imaginations, without thinking of God’s will and their duties towards Him and towards their fellow-creatures. Indeed the word Duty seems forgotten among them; they speak only of Rights.” ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=616))

- In this reform effort, the church is to make clear that love is the governing principle of political and social life and that obedience to God’s will is the only sound basis for social regeneration. Ludlow held that it is idolatrous to place one’s hope in political and social mechanisms. These are tools meant to promote social wellbeing, but they must be founded on right Christian principles guided by love. On this point, Ludlow and Maurice were in complete agreement.

- The fourth is that, because of their convictions about equality before God, the social nature of humankind and the central importance of moral reform rather than institutional change, they preferred to speak of social duties rather than rights.

- In this brief statement of the meaning of the incarnation, Bishop Westcott says quite a lot. Christ is not simply a man. Christ encompasses all humankind united with God as God has intended from before time. All people, therefore, have a common origin, share one Father, enjoy a common nature, have a common status in the world as God’s designated representative and ruler and share a common destiny, namely, to live eternally in the life of God. However, to these points must be added another of crucial importance. Christ does all these things as the “Sinless Head” of “the human race.” It is through the sinless Christ that the human race is enabled to “realize the Divine Father.” ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=704))

- concluded his remarks about the necessity of ideals for social reform with this prescription for rectifying the materialism and selfishness of his age: materialism results in inequality, no “enthusiasm” (desire) for service, and no stable peace. We accept wealth as the standard of success and skill as a means of overcoming an opponent, and the final appeal is to force. But “the contemplation of a great ideal” will constrain us to recognize that classes, nations, races rejoice and suffer together, that our possessions and powers are instruments of service.

- the Christian Socialists linked to Christ’s incarnation, Gore insisted that the incarnation not be understood as the crown of natural or historical development. There may be or may not be progress in both nature and history, but Christ does not arise as the result of natural progression. He is born into history from above. He does not arise out of it from below. According to Gore, if one takes this second view, the Old Testament becomes irrelevant and redemption is reduced to an aspect of historical progress. Further, if one takes this view, divine love is equated with human love and divine judgment is jettisoned as an archaic, even barbarous notion. In giving priority to the doctrine of the incarnation, Gore did not deny the intractable, pervasive nature of sin and so also the need for an atoning sacrifice. He insisted that, in discussing the incarnation, one give attention to the redemptive work of Christ. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=763))

- Yet, with his fellow Christian Socialists, he believed firmly that the church ought never to support state socialism. Such a centralization of wealth and power most certainly would lead to disaster. In this respect, he also believed firmly that the incarnation makes clear the priority of communal claims over individual ones. In spite of all his nods to historical development Gore was no utopian. He vigorously opposed the cult of progress then pervasive in Christian Socialist circles. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08SJ95Y6Z&location=808))
