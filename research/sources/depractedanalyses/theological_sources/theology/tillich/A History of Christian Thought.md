- Now we come to a fourth concept, the concept of harmony. This concept is part of the fundamental faith of the Enlightenment. In my terminology we could call harmony its ultimate concern. All the philosophers of the Enlightenment use this concept directly or indirectly, explicitly or implicitly. All of them elaborated their systems under the guidance of this principle. ([Location 5853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5853))
- The ancient Pythagoreans spoke of a universal harmony, of a cosmic harmony, but in spite of every individual thing and every individual human being seemingly going their own way. Yet, through all there was an overarching harmony. The Greek word cosmos which we translate by universe originally meant beauty and harmony. The Pythagoreans discovered mathematical formulae for the musical harmonies. They believed in the harmony of the sounds produced by the movement of the stars. ([Location 5859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5859))
- Of course, the Pythagoreans also knew that there is a split in reality, which they symbolized by the split between the even and the odd numbers. The odd numbers represent the good, the even numbers the bad, because the odd numbers are perfect. They are finished; the even numbers can be divided and are therefore unfinished. For all Greek thinking the finished is the good, the unfinished is the bad. ([Location 5864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5864))
- The first clear expression of this in the secular realm can be seen in the area of economics. It was expressed by Adam Smith (1723-1790) of the Manchester School of Economics in his idea of harmony. The idea is that in spite of the fact that everyone may be motivated by the profit interest, each one out for his own profit, in the end the total aims of production and consumption will be reached according to some hidden law. With many qualifications, this idea also underlies the theory of modern American capitalism. There is this basic belief in harmony. In spite of the fact that producer, seller, and buyer fight with each other, each bargaining for the greatest possible profit or for the best deal, somehow the laws of economics will be at work behind their backs in such a way that the best interests of all concerned and of the whole society will be satisfied. ([Location 5881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5881))
- The same principle is valid in politics. According to the philosophers of the Enlightenment, democracy presupposes that if every person follows his own reasoning, a general consensus or a majority will can be formed which is to the advantage of all. Then the minority should be prepared to acknowledge that the will of the majority was the true will of the whole, the volonte generate—the mystical concept of Rousseau who distinguishes the volonte generate, the general will, from the will of all. The majority does not represent the will of all, because there is the opposition, but it represents the general will, the true will which is driving toward the best interests of the group as a whole. ([Location 5890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5890))
- If there is no belief in this harmony, democracy cannot work, for the minority will not accept the validity of the decision of the majority. ([Location 5895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5895))
- As soon as a democratic majority appears which is disliked by the military leaders, they instigate a •putsch to overthrow the government. This is the chief characteristic of the negation of democracy. As soon as there is no belief in harmony, that is, in the providential validity of the majority decision, then democracy is impossible.— ([Location 5896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=5896))
- The most profound expression of this idea of harmony in philosophy is to be found in Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), the German philosopher. The whole classical period of German and European philosophy in general is to a great extent dependent on him. He was great enough at the same time so that he can now be the beloved figure of present-day analytic philosophers because he had the splendid idea of « Lessing's Theological Writings, translated by Henry Chadwick (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1957). describing all reality in terms of a logical calculus! Leibniz used the term "harmony," and spoke of a pre-established harmony which makes the operations of reality in all realms possible.

- In Frankfurt at that time I tried to show my students that every great philosophy combines two elements. The one is its vitality, its lifeblood, its inner character; the other is the emergency situation out of which the philosophy grows. No great philosopher simply sat behind his desk, and said, "Let me now philosophize a bit between breakfast and lunch time." All philosophy has been a terrible struggle between divine and demonic forces, skepticism and faith, the possibility of affirming and of negating life.

- This element of classicism was very strong in the early writings of Hegel when he described, for example, the ideal political system. He always described the ideal of the Greek polis, the city-state, in which religion and culture were united and in which the individual participated democratically in the whole ([Location 7141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=7141))

- But because of his sober mind, he very soon separated himself from many of the emotional elements of Romanticism and even criticized them in his greatest published work, The Phenomenology of Mind.ls This title is an unfortunate translation of Die Phanomenologie des Geistes, for Geist in German means "spirit." There we see another element being introduced, namely, the cause of the French Revolution. The students of the theological school in Tubingen participated in the French Revolution to the great anger of the ruling prince of Wurttemberg. Yet, they did not become revolutionaries because that is not the German temperament. Only in spirit did they become revolutionary, but not in a political way.

- Hybris is a Greek word which is often translated as pride. But it should not be so translated because pride is a particular moral or antimoral attitude. It is possible to be without pride and full of hybris, extremely humble but in this humility remain in a state of hybris. The best translation is "self-elevation toward the realm of the divine." That is what it means in Greek tragedy. The great heroes are those who fall into hybris, who try to elevate themselves to the life of the gods, and who then are cast down by the tragic reaction of the divine powers.

- Here you see that the history of philosophy is more than the history of some interesting ideas which people find to contradict in each other. The history of philosophy is the history of man's self-interpretation, and any such self-interpretation stands not only under the judgment of logic but also under the judgment of the meaning of existence as a whole. This is the responsibility of thinking and at the same time its greatness. ([Location 7167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=7167))

- Perhaps one of the ways in which we can try to overcome such difficulties is by reintroducing the concept of spirit, with a small "s" and not use this term for God alone with a capital "S." For if you cannot experience what spirit is in yourself, you cannot apply it symbolically or analogically to God either. When we have a doctrine of man as spirit, we must define spirit as the unity of mind and power, the unity of creativity—which makes human culture possible—and vitality—which is the life-power of man. Spirit is a dynamic concept. If you take away the power element of spirit, as you do by using only the concept of mind, what is left is simply intellectual movement.

- The intellectualization of the mental side of man results in placing the emotional element outside the intellect, in depriving us of what we find in Plato's doctrine of eros, namely, the unity of the emotional, the volitional, and the intellectual elements in the person as a whole; it results also in a loss of what is meant in the Christian concept of gnosis, as Paul used it, which means both knowledge and union. Knowing God means a union of man's spirit with the divine Spirit. It does not mean episteme, that is, detached scientific knowledge, inquiry into the structure of finite things. Gnosis always means union, and if the word were not so distorted today, we could say, mystical union, ([Location 7185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=7185))

- For Hegel God is absolute spirit and man is relative spirit; or God is infinite spirit and man is finite spirit. To say that God is Spirit means that he is creative power, not creative power in a naturalistic sense of a mere objective process, but creative power united with mind, or perhaps better, with meaning. This creative power in union with meaning produces in men personal self-consciousness and creates through men culture, language, the arts, the state, philosophy, and religion. All these things are implied in the concept of the spirit. ([Location 7192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=7192))

- I have often said that I am a crusader for the rescuing of the word "spirit" with a small "s." We need the word. All other languages have it. In French we have esprit, in German Geist, in Hebrew ruach, in Latin s-piritus, and in Greek pneuma, but in English this word has been more or less lost, in part due to British empiricism and in part due to Descartes' division of man into intellect and body. In spite of all Descartes' greatness in creating the method of modern scientific and philosophical analysis, we must say that from the standpoint of the doctrine of man he has omitted the real center of man, which is between mind and body. Formerly this was called "soul"—a word which is now forbidden by the watchdogs of language in every university, because this word is connected with sentimentality and has no scientific value; this despite the fact that it is the central concept in Aristotle's doctrine of man, namely, •psyche, which must be translated by anima (Latin) or soul.

- All life processes are manifestations of the divine life, only they appear in time and space whereas in God they are in their essential nature. God actualizes his own potentialities in time and space, through nature, through history, and through men. God finds himself in his personal character in man and his history, in the different forms of his historical actualization. God is not a person besides other persons. The absolute Spirit of which Hegel speaks is not a being beside the finite spirit, but in God its essential reality is given. In time and space it becomes actualized, yet at the same time estranged from its essential character. ([Location 7211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=7211))

- I want to give you here the theology of the most successful of all theologians since the Reformation, namely, Karl Marx. I will consider him as a theologian. And I will show you that without doing this, it is impossible to understand the history of the twentieth century and large sections of the late nineteenth century. If you consider him only as a political leader or as a great economist, which he also was, or as a great sociologist, which he was even more, then you cannot understand from what sources the power came which transformed the whole world and conquered nearly half of it in the twentieth century.

- Very similarly to Kierkegaard he placed the individual in the center, but unlike Kierkegaard it was the individual without any relationship to God, but only to himself, and therefore without any norm. This was one of the things which produced the resistance of Marx. For this reason I must mention Max Stirner here. He was a neurotic personality and an extremist. Of course, as a mere individual he could not survive for one day without being dependent on others who provided for him. But this is not important for him; he forgets it. The absolute autonomy of the individual is described by him in almost ecstatic words. ([Location 8180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8180))

- And the beatniks of today who attack society forget the fact that it is the basis of their whole existence every minute. The same is true of Kierkegaard. The church which he attacked so radically, with its tradition within culture, was the basis of his statement that in the years A.D. 1-30 God came to man. Without the tradition of the church which produced both the Bible and the church nothing would have come to Kierkegaard, and his whole relationship to God would not have been possible. This is an idea that you should remember when someone attacks "organized religion"—a bad term—and says, I am very religious, but I am against organized religion. That is nonsense. It is nonsense because in his personal religiousness—excuse this terrible word—he is dependent on the tradition of the church for 7 Max Stirner is the pseudonym of Johann Kasper Schmidt, author of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum (Leipzig: O. Wigand, 1901). every word, every symbol that he might use in prayer, in contemplation or mystical experience. Without the community of speaking, there is no speaking whatsoever, and without an inner speaking, there is no spiritual life whatsoever. In this way it is easy to refute these attacks against organized religion. You can and should attack the forms and the ways in which it may be organized, but to use the term "organized religion" as name-calling is totally senseless. It simply shows lack of thought, and is usually rooted in bad experiences in childhood or more likely in Sunday School, which is one of the great laboratories in which Christian faith is expelled from children.

- Marx's criticism of Feuerbach held that materialism is not much better than idealism. It is a little bit better because idealism is merely ideology without any basis in reality. Materialism is closer to reality. But if only the individual is considered in the materialistic philosophy, then it is as bad as idealism. For its universal concept of man is abstracted from the individual and overleaps the social conditions in which man finds himself.

- Then there is ethical materialism, which means being interested only in material goods, in money, etc. When someone is called a materialist in propaganda, no clear distinction is made between ethical and metaphysical materialism. If Marxism is called materialistic, for example, the trick of propaganda is to leave the impression of an ethical materialism. In reality, however, the original socialist movement and also the kind of communism you find in the original Marx attacked the materialism of the bourgeois society, where everything was dependent on buying and selling, on profit, etc. So Marxism was just the opposite. Now the critics of the materialism of the bourgeois society are called materialists, usually with the connotation of ethical materialism, of being interested only in material goods.

- Man is not man as an individual. The idea of the individual existing by himself is an illusion. This sounds quite different from Kierkegaard and Stirner. But Marx saw that we are really members of a social group. It is impossible to abstract ourselves from sociological reality. So he criticized Hegel and Feuerbach because they did not see individual men as members of a social structure. What is needed is an analysis of the social structure and the individual's place within it. ([Location 8227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8227))

- Like Kierkegaard, Marx speaks of the estranged situation of man in the social structure of the bourgeois society. He uses the word "alienation" (Entfremdung) not from the point of view of the individual but of society. In Hegel estrangement means the absolute Spirit goes over into nature, becoming estranged from itself. In Kierkegaard it means the fall of man, the transition by a leap from innocence into knowledge and tragedy. In Marx it means the structure of the capitalist society.

- For Marx estrangement means that the social situation results in dehumanization. When he speaks of mankind in the future, he speaks of true humanism.

He looks for the re-establishment of a true humanity to replace the dehumanization… ([Location 8235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8235))

- These descriptions imply that man is essentially not an object, not a thing, but a person. Man is not the tool but the highest end or aim. He is not a commodity but the inner telos for everything that is done. Man is the inner meaning and aim. Marx's description of dehumanization or the particular form of estrangement that existed in capitalist society completely contradicts what he had inherited from classical humanism. He saw no reconciliation. In historical reality there is only dehumanization and estrangement. Out of this came the power to change the situation. When Marx in the Communist Manifesto spoke about the liberation of the masses from their chains, these chains were the powers of dehumanization produced by the working conditions of capitalist society. Consequently, the essential character of man is lost. Man on both sides of the class conflict is distorted by the conditions… ([Location 8240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8240))

Nature is only the stuff out of which tools are made, and by means of the tools consumer goods are manufactured. Nature itself has ceased to be a subject with which we as subjects can be united in terms of eros, the love which sees in nature the inner power of being, the ground of being which is creatively active… ([Location 8248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8248))

- The reason for this is that Marx lacked a vertical criticism against himself. This is the same situation that we have in all Communist countries, the lack of a vertical criticism. On the horizontal they have a lot of truth, but they cannot put this under the criticism of the vertical, because they have cut it off. Nobody can do that completely, but they have done it to a great extent.

- The churches were the representatives of the ideologies which kept the ruling classes in power over against the working masses. This was the tragic situation. It is a great thing that in America this tragedy has happened on a much smaller scale. But in Europe it has led to the radical antireligious and anti-Christian attitudes of all labor movements, not only of the Communists but also of the social democrats. It was not the "bad atheists"—as propagandists call them—who were responsible for this; it was the fact that the European churches, Orthodox, Lutheran, and Episcopalian, were without social sensitivity and direction. They were directed toward their own actualization; they were directed toward liturgical or dogmatic efforts and refinements, but the social problem was left to divine providence.

- I remember the great churches in the workers' quarters in Berlin. Workers did not enter the church except for baptism, marriage, and the funeral. The churches provided some glorification of these events. But any inner relation to the churches did not exist. To a typical Lutheran minister of that time I said: The workers cannot hear the Christian message. You must do it differently. You cannot expect that they will come into the churches. His answer was: They hear the church bells ringing every Sunday morning, and if they do not come to the church services, they will feel guilty. But they did not hear anything, and they did not know anything. They had no relation to the religious symbols of the tradition. The Lutheran attitude was that the people can come to hear the Christian message in the church. At least the people hear the bell ringing, and that is enough. If they do not come, they will be rejected by God. ([Location 8293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8293))

- The existentialist element in Marx is very great. His concept of truth has a similarity to Kierkegaard's. Truth is truth for human existence, truth which concerns our life-situation. We said that Kierkegaard defined truth as an objective uncertainty passionately held. Marx defines truth in terms of the gap between theory and practice. That is to say, truth must be related to the social situation. A philosophical theory which is not involved in the social situation is not true. We have something of this in pragmatism and in John Dewey. ([Location 8300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8300))

- Here we must cautiously avoid a mistaken idea. In Marx there is no glorification of the proletariat. The revolutionary movements made the proletariat the messiah, the savior, so to speak, not because the proletarians are such wonderful people—Marx never believed that; he knew them—but because they stood at a particular point in history which involved them in a class struggle, and through this struggle a new reality might come into existence. Marx knew that the class split distorted both sides in the situation. Men were made into objects. The leading bourgeois and the working masses are in the same boat with respect to dehumanization. But the proletariat had one advantage. They experienced the estrangement in such a way that they would be forced to revolt.

- So in the Marxist criticism of society a biblical truth has been applied to an analysis of the social situation. When one speaks about the saving power of the proletariat, this does not mean that the proletariat is good and the others are bad. Marx's friend Engels was a big businessman, a capitalist. But the structure of the situation puts the proletariat on the lowest level where the need for revolution is felt. Through its revolutionary role it is thought to be the saving power.

- This idea of the remnant restricts to a certain extent the messianism of the proletariat. In the last analysis it is not the whole proletariat, but the leading groups in it, the vanguards, who are decisive. So a simple identification of the proletariat with messianism is limited by the fact that it is those who are the vanguards who have a messianic role. These vanguards are not always even members of the proletariat. They are people like Marx and Engels who come from the intelligentsia or the upper classes and have broken through their own ideological selfseclusion. They have learned what is going on in history and can join the vanguards. ([Location 8329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8329))
- The tragic thing is that the revolutionary movements in Europe, Asia, and Africa originally came from a prophetic message, but when they became victorious, they did not apply their own criticism against themselves. They could not do it, because they had nothing above themselves. The Communists in Russia answer all the problems in the East-West discussion without showing the element of ultimate selfcriticism. Of course, there is much self-criticism in individual groups in Communist countries. There are individuals who confess they have sinned. But they have always sinned against the party; there is nothing higher than the party; the party cannot err; the party is infallible. The lack of the transcendent line is the reason for the tragic situation that the revolutionary movement which set out to liberate a whole social class has resulted in a new slavery, the totalitarian slavery as we have it today in the Communist systems. This is a world-historical tragedy. ([Location 8338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8338))
- For him will is original being. It is being itself. We can describe being most adequately in terms of will. Being is not a thing; it is not a person; it is will. This idea of will refers to what is often called today "unconscious instinct." But the word "instinct" should be dropped if you are translating Freud. The word "drive" should be used instead. Man has no death instinct. That is a misuse of the word "instinct." But man does have the death drive in himself. Voluntarism is one of the great lines of thought in the history of philosophy and theology, which has been in continual tension with the other great line of thought which goes back to Aristotle and includes among others Thomas Aquinas, the nominalists, the British empiricists, Kant, to a great extent Schelling and Hegel, and modern language analysis. These two lines of thought have made the Western philosophical movements full of life and tension. In naming Thomas Aquinas we should also mention immediately Duns Scotus and William of Ockham as his voluntaristic opponents. ([Location 8353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8353))
- Where does voluntarism come from? Its first clear appearance is in Augustine, who embodies the element of will in his own personal character in a much more dynamic way than it appears in most of the Greek philosophers and writers. Augustine is the philosopher of will, and especially of that will which is love. The substance of all reality for him is will. He could have written Schelling's statement that original being is will, but since it deals with the creation of God he calls it love. Love is original being; the power of love is the substance in everything that is. This love (amor) loves itself (amor amorist, the self-affirmation of the will which is divine love. ([Location 8370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8370))
- In the Franciscan school will precedes intellect. ([Location 8377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8377))
- This is not a vague statement about man's psychology; it is always meant ontologically. That means that in God himself, in the creative ground of being, either will or intellect is the primary power. ([Location 8378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8378))
- Now in the thirteenth century Bonaventura was one of the great Franciscans in whom will was the decisive thing, that is, will as love. He was a great mystic and also an early general of the Franciscan order. This mysticism of love goes back also to Saint Francis. Standing in radical opposition to Thomas Aquinas was Duns Scotus, himself a Franciscan, and the greatest critical mind of the whole Middle Ages and one of the most important philosophical minds of the Western world. Both Thomas and Scotus lived in the thirteenth century. Scotus defined God as will and nothing other than will. In another Franciscan, William Ockham, this became an irrational will. Ockham is the father of nominalistic philosophy of the later Middle Ages. ([Location 8382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8382))
- If God is sheer will, he can do what he wants. He has within himself no intellectual limits. There is no logos structure which would prevent him from doing what he wants. The world is in every moment dependent on something absolutely unknown. Ultimately nothing in the world can be calculated. Only insofar as it is ordered by God can it be calculated, but God can withdraw both the natural and the moral orders. ([Location 8388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8388))
- First the term "will." It is very important that in all these men you understand what the idea of will means. If you examine a text on psychology, you will find that usually will is derived from other elements, the vital drive, on the one hand, and the intellect, on the other hand. It is presented as a secondary phenomenon and primarily as a conscious phenomenon. If will is taken in this way, it is impossible to understand how will can be identified with being itself. How can there be will in stones and crystals and plants and animals? They have no consciousness; they have no purpose which is directed by an intellect expressing itself in language, using universals, etc. But this is not what ([Location 8409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8409))
- will means if it is understood in an ontological sense. Will is the dynamics in all forms of life. Only in man does it become conscious will. If I decide to go to my office after this lecture, that is a conscious act of my will. In voluntaristic philosophy will is not restricted to a conscious psychological act. You cannot derive the meaning of will from man's psychological experience of himself as a consciously willing being. Nevertheless, the word must be used. Will for these ontologists appears in man as conscious will, in animals as instinct or drives—these appear also in man—in plants as urges, and in material reality as trends such as gravitation, etc. If you understand will as the dynamic element in all reality, then it makes sense. ([Location 8414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8414))
- The term "intellect" is also subject to misunderstanding. The idea as the ontologists have used it does not refer to the I.Q. of the college boy. Intellect comes from the Latin "inter-legere," to read between. To read between means to be in something, to be in the reality and reading it, being aware of it. That means participating in the form of things. Readable things have a form. The substance, the dynamics, you cannot read; they are dark; they are the drives. Reading, which is here meant metaphorically, is only possible where there is form. The word "understanding" has a similar metaphorical meaning. Standing under or reading between have the same meaning. They refer to a position in which we are in the reality itself and are able to become aware of its particular form. This awareness we call cognition. ([Location 8419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8419))
- First we must say something about this word "power." I have already had to rescue the word "will" from the misunderstanding that it is merely a psychological phenomenon; rather, it is the universal driving dynamics of all life processes. Now I must rescue the word "power" in Nietzsche from a similar misunderstanding. For him power is the selfaffirmation of being. Will-to-power means will to affirm one's power of living, the will to affirm one's own individual existence. In man this willto-power becomes will to personal and social power. That is not the primary concept, but it is a part of the whole concept. ([Location 8444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8444))
- He asks us to affirm this life in its great ambiguity. Out of this he then has another kind of God, a God in which the demonic underground, the Dionysian underground, is clearly visible. The victory of the element of rationality or of meaning is not as clear as in other philosophers like Kant or Hegel, Hume or Locke, but there is an opening up of vitality, and its half-creative, half-destructive power. ([Location 8459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8459))
- Now where do the norms of life come from? Nietzsche has a theory very similar to that of Feuerbach and Marx. This is his theory of resentment. The Jewish-Christian idea of justice, the Greek-Christian idea of logos, and the Christian idea of love are all ideas which result from the resentment of the masses against the aristocratic rulers. It is the revolution of resentment. ([Location 8462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8462))
- The concept of rationalization shows how the individual man tries to give reasons in a system of values for his natural drives of eros and will-to-power. ([Location 8469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8469))
- The concept of ideology revealed the interest of the ruling classes in preserving their power by producing a transcendent system to divert the masses from their immediate situation of disinheritance. ([Location 8474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8474))
- Nietzsche's psychology of resentment all the ideas of justice, equality, democracy, liberalism, etc., are born out of the resentment of the masses, and the most powerful bearers of this resentment are the religions of Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, this resentment functions in the exact opposite way from Marx's notion of ideology. The ideas produced by resentment are an attack against the ruling classes, while in Marx the ideological system is a weapon of the ruling classes to keep the others down. ([Location 8478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8478))
- Epithumia is the vital drive ([Location 8483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8483))
- philia is the friendship type of love, the person-toperson relationship; eros is the creative, cultural love toward the good, the true, and the beautiful; agape is the word used in the New Testament meaning the acceptance of the other one as a person, which includes the principle of justice. It is the power of reuniting with the other person as one standing on the same ultimate ground, and therefore he is the object of acceptance, forgiveness, and transformation. That is the Christian idea of agape. ([Location 8483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8483))
- Now this agape was sentimentalized long before our time. It was sentimentalized in Romanticism. The concept of Christian love could hardly be distinguished from sentimental desire or from pity. Especially pity was identified with the Christian idea of love. So charity replaced love in the sense in which I have just defined it. Against all this Nietzsche fought with the will to the self-affirmation of life. He is the greatest critic, not of the Christian idea of love, although he thinks it is the Christian idea of love, but of the sentimentalized idea of love, where love is reduced to compassion. In the name of power, the will-to-power, self-affirmation of life, he fights against this idea which undercuts the strong life. ([Location 8487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8487))
- Nietzsche made a good point which we ought to remember in our preaching of love. He said, you speak of selfless love and want to sacrifice yourself to the other one, but this is only a way for the weak person to creep under the protection of somebody else. Erich Fromm, the psychoanalyst, has called this wrong kind of love which Nietzsche attacked "symbiotic love"—from syn and bios, meaning "living together." This is a love of the weak man for the other one who once lived from his strength, and it is a form of love which exploits the other one. This kind of self-surrender has the unconscious desire for exploitation. This is what Nietzsche was actually fighting against. ([Location 8492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8492))
- But Nietzsche meant that when the traditional idea of God falls, something else must fall along with it. The system of ethical values on which society is based fell, and this is the important consequence of this symbol of the death of God. Of course, this is a symbol, for it can only mean that God is dead as far as man's consciousness of him is concerned. The idea that God in himself is dead would be absurd. The idea is rather that in man the consciousness of an ultimate in the traditional sense has died. ([Location 8509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8509))
- somebody else must replace God as the bearer of the system of traditional values. This is man. In the past man had to hear the "thou shalt" and the "thou shalt not" as that which is derived from God or an objective system of values. But now this is gone. So in place of this Nietzsche put man who says "I will." Man no longer says "I shall" because of God, but he says "I will" because I will. I act because I will and I decide what is good or evil. ([Location 8512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8512))
- This idea has many implications. One of them is Nietzsche's famous phrase, "the transvaluation of all values." All the traditional values must be replaced by other ones. Not any transcendent authority does this, but man does it. Who is this man? Does this not imply a tremendous overr estimation of man's greatness? Certainly Nietzsche did not think very highly of man. The mass man who appeared with the industrialization of the European countries was full of resentment; he was weak; he surrendered to the powerful; he produced ideologies which promise him happiness in heaven because he cannot have it on earth. That is man as Nietzsche knew him. So it is not this man, this mass man, who can say "I will." It is the superior man. Nietzsche speaks of the Ubermensch, which could be translated as superman… ([Location 8515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8515))
- Where does this superior man come from? He comes from the development of mankind in a Darwinian sense. When you study Nietzsche you should not forget that this was the time in which Darwinism reached its high point. He simply accepted Darwin's idea of the selective process of life in which the weaker species are annihilated and the stronger ones survive to produce still stronger ones. This evolutionary idea of Darwin is the background to Nietzsche's idea of the superior… ([Location 8522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8522))
- Nietzsche did not think merely of an educational, spiritual development of mankind from lower to higher levels of moral education and ethical life, as has usually been thought of in the Western world. Nietzsche would accept this idea too, but he took Darwin in a much more literal and naturalistic way. The superior man is also stronger physically. He is a man straight in body and soul, as he said. In some of his metaphors, this man is even the wild beast, but the wild beast on the human level,… ([Location 8526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8526))
- If this presupposition is not accepted, Nietzsche would be justified. The superior men are the strong ones, full of unbroken vitality, shaped by strict self-discipline, indeed the very ideal of the aristocratic personality. In contrast to them there is the one symbolized in his expression "the last man." His description of the last man is the antitype to the superior man. He is the man who knows everything, but does not care for anything—half-sleepy, half-indifferent, completely conformist, and full of abandoned creativity. He is like the caricature of the "organization man" described in current sociological literature. The mass man avoids at all costs being controversial; therefore he accepts subjection to conformism in all respects. He is disinterested, without any ultimate concern, bored, cynical, empty. All of these descriptions are given in a poetic way by Nietzsche. This is what he calls the nihilism toward which our culture is running. ([Location 8535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8535))
- When Fascism and Nazism and early Communism used Nietzsche's categories, they did it with the feeling that the coming nihilism of which Nietzsche spoke would make mankind into a herd of higher animals without creativity, satisfied merely with food and clothes, etc. So this ideology was welcomed by the Fascists and the Nazis. They often used Nietzsche, but they left out one thing. They left out the spiritual aspect. Nietzsche's idea of the superior man includes the bodily and the spiritual or the mental. ([Location 8542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8542))
- For Nietzsche the idea of the higher race is the aristocratic idea which you can find in all races and nations. It is the vertical idea of racial superiority. It comes from the medieval ideal of the aristocratic personality shaped by strict self-discipline. ([Location 8549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8549))
- But in Nazism there was the horizontal idea of race, the idea that a particular biological race is superior to others. Then a particular nation or a particular race, like the Nordic race, becomes the group of superior men. Everything becomes vulgar. In this light you can understand better the quasi-religious demonry of Nazism. It was in opposition to the danger of the industrial society symbolized in the idea of the last man who only looks at things with cynicism and without eros.

    - **Note:** Nietzche’s Last Man who has no norms and views all with cynicism and lost Eros is key to understanding Trumpism.
- the famous idea of the eternal return. What is decisive in it is the affirmation of life. Nietzsche expresses this by having Zarathustra teach his disciples to say that in the experience of death they will affirm every moment of it. This is Nietzsche's eschatology; this is his hope. Although his life was full of misery, in opposition to this he affirmed it infinitely. ([Location 8565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0719P6ZLK&location=8565))

- When we use the word "naturalism" we should be clear about what type we have in mind. Today we call the mechanistic or materialistic typ of naturalism a reductive naturalism in which everything is reduced to the movement of atoms. It denies that mind and life have any independent reality. They are supposed to be epiphenomenal; 'phenomenal because they exist and you cannot deny that there is life and spirit; and epx because they are secondary and superficial, and not a part of any substantial reality. That is not a profound philosophy at all. But it is only one form of naturalism. Nietzsche represented quite another one which was great, although presented in a half-demonic form.

- the terms "will" and "power" in the ordinary sense. Rather, it is the urge toward life in everything that is, even beyond the organic life. It is a metaphysical concept. For the nonhuman dimension the word "urge" would even be more adequate. And "power" is not social, political, or economic power, but rather the self-affirmation of life, not only in the sense of preserving life, but of the further development of life. In this respect, Nietzsche's idea is an adequate description of life processes as we can observe them in ourselves and in nature, so no criticism is needed. But insofar as the world of norms in relation to the will-to-power is lost in Nietzsche, criticism proves to be necessary. It is precisely this lack of normative principles which has made it possible for the Nazis to misuse Nietzsche. Nietzsche himself had the aristocratic norms.

- I would also have to criticize his doctrine of the eternal return. His idea is a return to the classical circular notion of repetitious time. There is a lack of novelty, of the really new. True, Nietzsche did have a strong emphasis on the new in history. He could speak of the renewal of all values, the transvaluation of values, and the coming of the superior man. There the concept of the new is present. But this happens only within a particular segment of the circle. Nothing absolutely new is created. A symbol such as the kingdom of God as the aim of history is very remote from Nietzsche. Nietzsche denied Augustine's idea that time is running toward something and not toward a point from which it has started.
