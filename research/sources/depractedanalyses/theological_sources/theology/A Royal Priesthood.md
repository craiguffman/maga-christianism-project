- O’Donovan certainly poses a stark antithesis, informed by his reading of Augustine, between the unique and universal claims of the gospel and the hubristic pretensions of a secularized late-modernity premised on a denial of transcendence, an assertion of the primacy of subjective will and a salvific pursuit of the technological domination of nature. To these aspects of late-modernity, the primary word sounded by the gospel, for O’Donovan as for his fellow modernity-critics, is one of judgement.

- The tradition he seeks to rediscover is the product of ideas and practices of over a thousand years of historical interactions between church and political authority, reaching its clearest expression in the early modern period. He opts to describe its culminating formulation simply as ‘early-modern liberalism’ in order to highlight its contrast with the ‘late-modern liberalism’ which he regards as its secularized antithesis.12 He also terms it ‘Christian liberalism’,13 ([Location 7453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7453))

- This structure discloses the fundamental shape of O’Donovan’s political thought, which is essentially this: what God has done in Jesus Christ is focused in the life and mission of the church,16 which is called to bear witness to the triumph of Christ before the world and its rulers, and to summon them to obedience to him.

- To display the liberal achievement correctly, we have to show it as the victory won by Christ over the nations’ rulers … Apart from this salvation-historical background, liberal expectations lose their meaning, which is to point to a bene esse of political society which presumes an esse. They represent a (provisional) perfection and fulfilment of political order which derives its political character from the rule of divine providence.

- O’Donovan’s fundamental concern is not so much philosophical as missiological: his leading question is not how far liberal political principles survive such a confrontation (though that is searchingly addressed), but rather how the inauguration of the kingdom has impacted upon the political arrangements we have come to inherit as ‘liberal’.

- framed the enduring character of European Christian society. That character, he claims, displays analogically the same narrative structure as is present in the gospel and the church – a structure that turns on ‘four moments’. The four features of liberal society disclosing the impact of the gospel are freedom, merciful judgement, natural right and openness to speech. These witness to the four moments of the gospel itself: advent, passion, restoration and exaltation.30 In turn, these four moments find their parallels in four features of the church, which exists as a gathering community, a suffering community, a glad community and a prophetic community. ([Location 7521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7521))
- as others have noted,34 why does the theologically central notion of ‘covenant’ play such a minor role in a political theology so indebted to the Old Testament idea of kingship, whereas it proved absolutely decisive for Calvinist and Puritan writers equally so indebted? ([Location 7535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7535))
- First, Christian freedom is ultimately what made possible the civil freedom we have come to associate with liberal society. ([Location 7546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7546))

- Freedom is not primarily ‘an assertion of individuality’ but rather ‘a social reality’; Christian freedom always remains engaged in society. Yet it issues forth in a form of individual liberty guaranteed by the prior claims of Christ over any existing social structure. ([Location 7553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7553))

- What O’Donovan means by ‘responsible government’ is something far more momentous: ([Location 7604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7604))

- Rulers, overcome by Christ’s victory, exist provisionally and on sufferance for specific purposes. In the church they have to confront a society which witnesses to the Kingdom under which they stand and before which they must disappear.

- Rulers are not simply responsible in some general way to God as origin of all authority, but specifically to the kingdom of Christ, the historical inauguration of which two millennia ago established an entirely new providential dispensation under which political authority is now required to acknowledge the authority of Christ.

- We might describe this position as a dispensationalist political eschatology. ([Location 7621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7621))
- is essential to note that he subscribes to the patristic notion, most fully articulated by Augustine and continued by Luther, of government as a post-lapsarian, remedial institution providentially established by God to curb human sinfulness and enforce a measure of ‘earthly’ justice until the return of Christ, who will usher in a new, heavenly order of peace and harmony in which political authority will be redundant and so pass away. ([Location 7622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7622))
- O’Donovan supplements this patristic conception with the strategically important assertion that, after the exaltation of Christ, God now commands governments publicly to lay down their own pretensions to supreme authority and concede sovereignty to him upon whom all authority in heaven and earth has been conferred. ([Location 7625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7625))

- (The church, we may add, is to proclaim this divine injunction, ([Location 7628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7628))
- The coming of Christ, then, functions as an eschatological turning point for political authorities. It precipitates an awesome moment of decision for all who bear political authority Anno Domini: will they acknowledge their responsibility to the exalted Christ, accept their limited, provisional authority as mere servants of earthly justice and peace, concede the legitimacy of the church as witness to a higher sovereignty, guarantee it the necessary social space, and listen attentively to its insights into what God has revealed about the requirements of justice and peace during this age? ([Location 7631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7631))
- This eschatologically charged notion of ‘responsible’ government, then, is the core of the political legacy of Christendom that has come to be crystallized in the early-modern liberalism which O’Donovan presents as the distinctive political contribution of the gospel.

- In the light of this new reading of the political situation, the early church was thus able to view government as ‘thrust back by Christ’s victory to the margins, there to be reauthorised to perform a single function of which the church outside the world stood in need for the time being’.

- second phase of the answer focused on the notion of Christian kingship.

- Christian liberalism taught judges to look over their shoulders when they pronounced on fellow-sinners’ crimes. It taught them they were subject to the higher judgment of God, who would judge mercifully those that judged mercifully. Ex-Christian liberalism inherited all the hesitancy; but, no longer grounded in religious humility, it became moral insecurity.

- belief in natural equality, once interpreted against the background of the differentiated claims of given communities of affinity, now ‘has the role of pulling down whatever walls of differentiation the builders of social order have erected … it is a changed notion altogether, atomic in its vision of human individuals, suspicious of any form of non-reciprocal relation’. ([Location 7784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7784))

- Contrary to the intentions of at least some of its framers, the First Amendment ‘ended up promoting a concept of the state’s role from which Christology was excluded, that of a state freed from all responsibility to recognise God’s self-disclosure in history’.

- Jacques Maritain, their twentieth-century descendent, comes in for the same criticism. His ‘democratic secular faith’ was offered as a public creed endorsable by all, but which could be justified differently in private by Christians and non-Christians. For O’Donovan, this means that the democratic creed, rather than the gospel, becomes the core of the church’s political message.

- O’Donovan, then, is no dogmatic advocate of the principle of Establishment, though he holds out as theologically permissible its legitimacy in principle and its possibility in some circumstances. ([Location 7869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7869))

    - **Tags:** #orange
- Christian pluralist reading of that role could argue that the inner logic of the judicial task itself renders such privilege unacceptable in principle even when attainable in practice. ([Location 7872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7872))
- For O’Donovan this form should, where possible, include a public confession of Christian faith by means of some model of Establishment. ([Location 7879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7879))
- For the pluralists, the state demonstrates its willingness to bow before the reign of Christ to the degree that (among other things) it relates to plural religious communities (churches, Christian organizations, etc.) in an impartial way. ([Location 7880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7880))

- O’Donovan always refers to the essential task of political authority in the form of the verbal noun ‘judgment’ (a notion he adopts from Paul Ramsey). ([Location 7894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7894))
- For him, the question of the nature of political authority is not first one of the authority of institutions, but of the political act. ([Location 7895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7895))
- ‘judgment’, not ‘justice’, is his preferred term: ([Location 7897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7897))
- When ‘judgment’ is present, it is not a state of affairs that obtains but an activity that is duly carried out. ([Location 7901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7901))

- This prioritizing of judicial agency is influenced by his larger understanding of salvation as the history of divine action, ([Location 7905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7905))
- his specific grounding of political authority in soteriological, not creational, categories. ([Location 7906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7906))
- Take, for instance, the OT principle of inalienable family land tenure, which seems to lie at the basis of the Jubilee provisions in Leviticus 25. Does this not point towards a universal principle of justice requiring an equitable distribution of essential material resources (however that might be realized in very diverse historical contexts)? Thus a just king intervening to invoke the Jubilee laws, or other related provisions, would be acting to restore (or perhaps implement for the first time) a universally valid normative principle of social order. ([Location 7916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7916))
- O’Donovan’s reservations about the modern constitutional principle of the ‘separation of powers’. ([Location 7928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7928))
- In his view, by contrast, ‘the court is the central paradigm of government – all government, in all its branches’.114 O’Donovan’s entirely laudable concern here is to resist any absolutization of one branch of government and to ensure the subordination of each to the definitive governmental task of judgement. ([Location 7935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7935))
- Legislators are not to suppose that they are entitled to generate public norms de novo. Rather, they are to discern the practical meaning, for this or that item of public policy, of the prior claims of justice rooted in divine and natural law (and, perhaps, already embodied in ‘custom’). ([Location 7941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7941))
- What he firmly opposes, however, is the attempt – an inherently fruitless one, he believes – to separate powers with the intention of deliberately pitting them against each other and so risking governmental incoherence or paralysis.116 Indeed, he takes such an arrangement to be indicative of social decline: ([Location 7948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09QG4VTGW&location=7948))
- he advocates unitary government because it allows for clarity in the expression of a society’s shared moral conscience. The prophetic community – and in the gospel era the church – then serves, not as a countervailing constitutional power, but as an alternative source of communal authority, calling such a unified government back to its subordination to divine and natural law.

- This question emerges at its sharpest in O’Donovan’s crucial distinction between ‘society’ and ‘government’: his position seems to be that salvation restores and vindicates the created orders of society, but restrains and disciplines the providential order of government.

- This is possible if we view the triumph of Christ in the political order not essentially or primarily as the disciplinary curtailment of a providential institution run amok, but as one among many equally dramatic demonstrations of God’s restorative action across the whole of human culture and history. The political consequence of Christus Victor is then not primarily the defeat and displacement of political authority, but its rehabilitation as a created, fallen, judged, but now redeemable, social good. Political authorities are not then ‘thrust back by Christ’s victory to the margins’, but, simply, put in their proper, creational place.

- Given the necessary dependence of law and policy upon principles of political morality (and, behind them, faith commitments), it cannot be otherwise. So where a large Christian majority (or indeed a substantial minority) actively takes up its political responsibilities through the representative process, the result will be a state bearing the impact of Christian political convictions. Thus while the state will, on this pluralist model, officially retain a posture of (what O’Donovan during the consultation termed) ‘confessional silence’, this should not be construed as confessional nakedness.

One moment is the exclusive identification of the state with the perceived interests of a particular group – whether racial, ethnic, or social, such that the state becomes its instrument, to achieve its collective will. The other moment is the state’s absolute self-elevation above the body politic: above its multiplicity of institutions, interests, authorities, communities, and moral sentiments, and above the inherited framework of customary and statutory law through which these are ordered.

But its theological significance has changed, its role in the divine economy ad extra has changed: it is no longer revealed to be the vehicle of salvation, but merely the guaranteed social space within which God’s saving work proceeds.
