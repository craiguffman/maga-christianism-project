### Highlights

- Thus Israel’s travail begins in a cry (2:23) and is transposed into doxological praise and celebration (15:21), sorrow turned to joy (see John 16:20) ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=1313))
- serves to make present in Israel’s imagination and life the rule of YHWH, without which the rule of Pharaoh remains unchallenged and uncurbed. ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=1316))
- The narrative gives the impression, however, that the oases are in fact only staging arenas for narratives of crisis, so that any geographical recovery of the sojourn is likely impossible and, in any case, is of little interest to the narrative community. ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=1336))
- they are in fact relational transactions that report in paradigmatic ways on Israel’s life with God. The themes that dominate the tradition include (a) the rebellious quarrelsomeness of Israel, (b) the generosity of God as sustainer, and (c) the anger of God at Israel’s rebellion. Where or when such encounters take place is immaterial, because they are in fact characteristic enactments of the faith of Israel.

- Hosea, Amos, and Micah are situated in the eighth century and so are related as “minor” partners to the “major” prophetic book of Isaiah. The defining contextual matter for this literature is the imposing reality of Assyrian imperial hegemony that threatened, in turn, the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.

- Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah are situated in the midst of the late seventh century and so are related as “minor” partners to the “major” prophetic book of Jeremiah. ([Location 4519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4519))
- Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi form a third triad that is in the wake of the exilic prophetic promises of Jeremiah 30–31, Ezekiel 40–48, and Isaiah 40–55. These high expectations from the exilic period were quickly transposed into the mundane reality of “small things” involved in the restoration of the land at the beginning of the Persian hegemony of the late sixth century under the leadership of Cyrus and then Darius (see Zech 4:10). The defining contextual reality for this literature is the new, more benign imperial policies of Persia that, unlike the policies of Babylon, permitted some reassertion of local religious and political traditions, of course under the more general aegis of the empire. Haggai ([Location 4526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4526))
- The book of Hosea stands first among the Twelve Minor Prophets. It announces the initial accent of indictment and sentence from broken covenant that provides the access point for the theological thematics of the Twelve. It is apparent that the book of Hosea is rooted in the life and words of the northern prophet in the eighth century (R. Wilson 1980, 225–31). It is not clear precisely when the work of the prophet is to be dated, but it is clearly related to the rise of Assyrian power and the abiding threat of Assyrian power against the northern kingdom. ([Location 4613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4613))
- The accent on broken covenant causes the prophet to speak particularly oracles that are “prophetic lawsuits” that indict Israel and announce a divine judgment against Israel (Westermann 1967). ([Location 4619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4619))
- The daring argument made by the poem is that the violation of Torah commandments, herewith an allusion to the Decalogue, will result in divine judgment, here the undoing of creation through a drought. It is the insistence of this most recurring form of prophetic speech in the eighth century that the world is covenantally coherent and must answer to the covenant Lord. ([Location 4635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4635))
- The first part, chapters 1–3, is famously about divorce and remarriage, that is, infidelity and fidelity and the crisis of broken covenant and renewed covenant. ([Location 4642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4642))
- Hosea’s bold theological articulation is deeply rooted in a personal experience of broken and restored relationship that the prophet receives and reports on as revelatory of the divine character and divine intentionality. ([Location 4644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4644))
- chapter 2 is among the most important presentations of covenantal theology in all of the Old Testament. Verses 2–13 portray the broken covenant of Israel with YHWH that eventuates in rejection and divorce. The theme of Israel’s infidelity is reported through a triangle of husband (YHWH), lover (Baal), and wife (Israel), who has forsaken husband YHWH in order to cohabit with lover Baal. This betrayal of the covenant evokes YHWH’s anger and eventual termination of the relationship. ([Location 4647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4647))
- The difference in Hosea’s presentation is that in Hosea 2, verses 2–13 are followed, astonishingly enough, by verses 14–23 in which the wounded and forsaken husband YHWH “re-woos” Israel and remarries her, a new marriage that causes the earth to flourish again (vv. 21–23). The bold theme of remarriage is as graphic as a new set of wedding vows that are the outcome of YHWH’s “courting”: And I will take you for my wife forever; I will take you for my wife in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. I will take you for my wife in faithfulness; and you shall know the LORD. (Hos 2:19–20) ([Location 4651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4651))
- First, Hosea seems to regard religious, cultic infidelity to YHWH through preoccupation with Baal as “Fertility God” as the besetting sin of Israel. Given that fact, it is remarkable that the poetry of Hosea utilizes the rhetoric of “fertility” (vv. 16–18, 21–23) in order to combat the seductions of Baal. Thus the argument is not that “fertility religion”—that is, appreciation of the “juices of new life” that occur in creation—is in principle bad, but it is that YHWH, not Baal, is the authoritative, reliable fertility God (Harrelson 1969). That is, the tradition of Hosea employs precisely the rhetoric of Baalism in order to combat Baalism, and to make the claim that the “power for life” is administered only by YHWH the Creator who is also the God of the Torah ([Location 4659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4659))
- It is most remarkable that Hosea casts the gravitas of covenantal faith in the categories of the most intimate relationship of fidelity. ([Location 4665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4665))
- First, the tradition of Hosea was situated in and addressed to the religious-political crisis of the north in the last days of the northern kingdom. It is clear, however, that this northern material was subsequently taken up by and found useful to the continuing life of Judah after Assyria had terminated the kingdom of Samaria in 721 B.C.E. Thus, for example, 2:7 recognizes the end of the northern kingdom but anticipates the continuation of the southern kingdom: ([Location 4668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4668))
- The second editorial maneuver, which may or may not be directly related to the eighth-century prophet, is that the devastating message of judgment concerning the unbearable infidelity of Israel toward YHWH, is matched, answered, and overcome by assurances about a future for Israel that follows judgment. It is not impossible that the eighth-century prophet entertained such expectation. It is in any case unmistakable that the completed book of Hosea offers assurance for Israel’s survival and well-being beyond the deep dislocation of judgment. As we have seen, 2:14–23 answers 2:2–13. It is not clear that the second half of the poem belongs to the eighth-century prophet; it is, however, quite clear, in the final form of the text, that the final word for Israel is restored well-being. ([Location 4692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4692))
- The theme of YHWH as “healer” is already known in Hosea (6:2). In this passage, however, the healing anticipated is a complete divine resolution of all suffering and judgment that has been visited upon YHWH’s people. The imagery through which the healing is announced, moreover, is itself the rhetoric of fertility, “blossom, root, shoot,” and so on. We may take this final affirmation of the book of Hosea as a characteristic editorial act that we have already seen in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. The prophetic corpus is framed to move the community of faith into and out of the crisis of displacement. While the theme of restoration becomes more vigorous in the latter parts of the Twelve, the traditioning process cannot leave even the first of the Twelve Minor Prophets unresolved. ([Location 4711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4711))
- Finally, I call attention to 11:1–9, among the most remarkable oracles in the entire prophetic literature. The oracle falls into three parts: 1.   Verses 1–4 review YHWH’s initial kindness to Israel under the rubric of attentive parent to a small child. 2.   Verses 5–7 voice YHWH’s profound indignation toward recalcitrant Israel, and YHWH’s resolve to permit Israel to be devastated by the sword, proper punishment for profound disobedience. 3.   But then in an inexplicable rhetorical maneuver not unlike the break between 2:13 and 2:14, it is as though YHWH reverses field and breaks from the anger of 5–7: How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. (Hos 11:8–9) It is as though YHWH, through the daring of the poet, reaches deeper into YHWH’s own sensibility. There YHWH discovers, so the poet dares to say, a deep passion and, consequently, deep compassion for Israel that precludes the destruction just announced in verses 5–7. In this text the anticipated and legitimate punishment of Israel is foresworn; this divine resolve is different from and much more radical than 14:4–7, where healing comes after devastation. Here the devastation is averted. ([Location 4717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4717))

- YHWH’s own sense of YHWH. YHWH is not “a man” to react in anger; YHWH, rather, is “God.” More than that, YHWH is “the Holy One in Israel,” the God whose holy character is profoundly qualified by loyalty to Israel. This sense of self on YHWH’s part is the ground for well-being in Israel, even when Israel’s shabby treatment of YHWH merits otherwise. Thus, the poetic tradition of Hosea reaches down into the poetic-rhetorical-emotional depths that move past any simple formula of disobedience and punishment or any other quid pro quo. ([Location 4738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4738))

- It is easy to see, nonetheless, how the tradition understood itself to be rooted in the intimate personal suffering of this anguished prophet who received the mandate: The LORD said to me again, “Go, love a woman who has a lover and is an adulteress.” (Hos 3:1a) That articulation of intimate reality moves immediately to become revelation of YHWH: … just as the LORD loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes. (Hos 3:1b) This poetic venture stands close to the lived reality of infidelity; the rhetoric, moreover, makes possible the life of YHWH in the midst of the defining infidelity that endlessly marks the life of Israel. The prophetic word is that such infidelity is indeed defining for Israel … but not finally so. ([Location 4747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SLHGTSG&location=4747))
