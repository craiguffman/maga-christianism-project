- swaraj, ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=144))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- introducing a distinction between swaraj as self-government or the quest for home rule or the good state, and swaraj as self-rule or the quest for self-improvement. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=145))
- Gandhi was anxious to teach the Indians that ‘modern civilisation’ posed a greater threat to them than did colonialism. They appeared to him to take it for granted that modern civilisation was an unmixed blessing, and colonialism an unmixed evil, forgetting that colonialism itself was a product of modern civilisation. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=151))
- The key to an understanding of Hind Swaraj lies in the idea that worldly pursuits should give way to ethical living. This way of life has no room for violence in any form against any human being, black or white’ ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=156))
- But it is an attempt to see beauty in voluntary simplicity, [voluntary] poverty and slowness. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=161))
- You cannot build non-violence on a factory civilisation, but it can be built on self-contained villages’ ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=163))

- In the past dharma was tied to a hierarchical system of duties and obligations and to the preservation of status. It gave little or no attention to the idea of democratic citizenship. Gandhi felt that the time had come to redefine the scope of dharma to include notions of citizenship, equality, liberty, fraternity and mutual assistance. And in Hind Swaraj he presents in simple language his notion of such a redefined dharma, ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=169))
- Gandhian civic humanism, ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=172))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- the Gita and the Ramayana had always contained in potentia, but something which Indian civilisation had not actualised fully in practice. In Hind Swaraj a conscious attempt is being made to actualise that potential. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=172))
- ‘We may read the Gita or the Ramayana or Hind Swaraj. But what we have to learn from them is desire for the welfare of others’ ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=176))

- the author’s conception of what modern India ought to become and how politics may be made into the highest form of the active life. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=180))
- Being critical implies the desire to improve the object criticised. So it is with Gandhi and modern civilisation. Thus he welcomes a number of its contributions – civil liberty, equality, rights, prospects for improving the economic conditions of life, liberation of women from tradition, and religious toleration. At the same time, the welcome is conditional in that liberty has to harmonise with swaraj, rights with duties, empirical knowledge with moral insight, economic development with spiritual progress, religious toleration with religious belief, and women’s liberation with the demands of a broader conception of humanity. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=188))
- The British constitution remained the standard by which to measure the quality of colonial administration: policies in conformity with it were thought to be good, and those contrary to it, evil. This was true even in the context of his doctrines of satyagraha. As he saw it, there was no inconsistency between these and loyalty to the constitution, for, as he said, a ‘love of truth’ lay at the root of both (CW 39:140).

- ‘that mode of conduct which points out to man the path of duty’ (sudharo, ch. XIII). Barbarism (kudharo) is the absence of civilisation. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=202))

- that ‘mode of conduct’ which emerged from the Enlightenment, and more exactly, from the Industrial Revolution. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=203))
- The Industrial Revolution for him was much more than a mere change in the mode of production. As he interprets it, it brought into being a new mode of life, embracing a people’s outlook on nature and human nature, religion, ethics, science, knowledge, technology, politics and economics. According to this outlook, nature was taken to be an autonomous entity operating according to its own laws, something to be mastered and possessed at will for the satisfaction of human needs, desires and political ambitions. This outlook brought about an epistemological revolution which in turn paved the way for the secularisation of political theory. The satisfaction of the desire for economic prosperity came to be identified as the main object of politics. Religion, when it was not dismissed as mere superstition, was valued only for its social and psychological use. The Industrial Revolution altered the concept of labour, now accepted mainly for its ability to produce profit, power and capital. Manual labour was looked upon as fit only for the unlettered and the backward. With the technological revolution that followed the industrial revolution, machines, hitherto allies of humans, seemed to assert their autonomy. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=205))

- the world for all practical purposes was divided into the industrialised and the non-industrialised, or the ‘civilised’ and the ‘non-civilised’, parts. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=217))
- He would in all sincerity use the very doctrine of liberty to justify imperial rule over India. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=219))
- His idea of nationalism does not start with the locality and then gradually extend itself to the province and finally to the nation. Quite the reverse. He was first an Indian, then a Gujarati, and only then a Kathiavadi. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=246))
- If Lenin connected colonialism to capitalism, Gandhi went one step further and connected colonialism to modernity itself. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=257))
- What was intrinsic to it was commercial expansion, the lust for domination and the glory resulting there-from. When the two forces – good of the colonised and the glory of empire – clashed, there was no doubt which would prevail. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=258))

- Christian civilisation and modern Western civilisation: ‘I do not mix up or confuse Western civilisation with Christian progress . . . I refuse to believe that all this [industrial and technological] activity connotes Christian progress, but it does connote Western civilisation’ (CW 8: 244).

    - **Tags:** #pink
- might is right and the survival of the fittest. Moreover, it lacked, he claimed, a ‘goal’, a telos, being ‘centrifugal’ and merely ‘dynamic’. Indian civilisation, on the other hand, had a goal; it was ‘centripetal’, ‘adaptive’ and ‘contemplative’. ‘A civilisation or a condition in which all the forces fly away from the centre must necessarily be without a goal, whereas those who converge to a point have always a goal’ (ibid.). ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=270))
- it was neither vulgar racism nor crass trade jealousy that motivated the thoughtful opponents of Indians in South Africa: what motivated them, in his view, was their concern for modern civilisation, of which they considered themselves the respresentatives, and which they wanted to protect and promote at all costs. They believed that ‘the nations which do not increase their material wants are doomed to destruction. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=275))
- Indians are disliked not for their vices but for their virtues – simplicity, perseverence, patience, frugality and otherworldliness. Westerners are enterprising, impatient, engrossed in multiplying their material wants and in satisfying them. They are afraid that allowing Indians to settle as immigrants in South Africa is tantamount to endorsing cultural suicide ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=282))
- On the contrary, he felt that contact between civilisations would be healthy and beneficial to the civilisations concerned. In particular, he was of the opinion that Indian civilisation would benefit greatly from its contact with Western civilisation. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=285))
- More importantly, it was on these visits that he came into contact with a very important segment of the newly emerging Indian middle class, the expatriate Indians living abroad. These were the new converts to modern civilisation, and it is their uncritical acceptance of their newly found secular faith that really bothered Gandhi. Modern civilisation was bad enough for Britain, but when imported into India and propagated there by Indians themselves, its potential for mischief became incalculable. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=307))
- To Gandhi they appeared to be misguided Indians fully committed to ‘modern civilisation’ who wished to fashion India on the model of Great Britain, Italy or Japan. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=318))

- In 1909, when Gandhi was still in London, four ‘Martyr Dhingra scholarships’ were established to honour the memory of the assassin of Sir William Curzon-Wyllie. The object of these educational endeavours was to bring bright Indian youths to Europe and America for training in the theory and practice of violent revolution.

- Mere constitutionalism, Gandhi knew from his South African experience, did not get anywhere nor did it raise the fundamental moral issue of the reform of the soul, which for Gandhi was a precondition for sound politics.

- His conceptions of nationalism and swaraj, he believed, were neutral as far as religion as sect was concerned. His vision of politics as it emerges in 1909 saw Indians as primarily members of a single nation (praja) and only secondarily as members of a sect or a caste or a region, Indians whose humanity would be strong enough to enable them to tolerate difference within the context of a deeper national identity.

- In defending the modern state merely as an efficient system of coercive power and nothing more than that, the colonial administrators were doing India a disservice. And in attempting to modernise India on the pattern of England and Japan, the modern middle class was wreaking economic havoc on India’s poor and the rural population.

- social scientists. They tended to reject the primacy of the conscience, inner illumination and inner change in favour of external or institutional changes. According to Tolstoy, however, religion is ‘the faculty of seeing prophetically the true meaning of life’; as such it is an indispensable source of all sound political theory. But moderns such as Renan, Strauss, Comte, Spencer and Marx either reject religion as superstition or value it only for its social or psychological uses.

- ‘Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands to others feelings he has lived through, and that others are infected by these feelings and also experience them . . . To evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced and, having evoked it in oneself, then by means of movements, lines, colours, sounds, or forms expressed in words, so to transmit that feeling that others experience the same feeling – this is the activity of art’ (Tolstoy 1924, 173).

- True political economy, unlike the one accepted by modernity, is the proper management of the nation’s labour. Now the proper management of the nation’s labour ought, Ruskin urged, to provide for both ‘utility and splendour’. In other words, it should provide for the basic needs for food, shelter and clothing, pleasant objects of minimum luxury, healthful rest, and serviceable leisure – and in that order. When labour is well managed, it would be able to provide for all these. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=575))

- The introduction of the new utilitarian state, with its new adversarial court system, led to the ruin of the villages as the ultimate unit of national life, shifting their economic power to the new urban centres and their quasijudicial and quasi-legislative powers to the new breed of lawyers condemned in chapter XI of Hind Swaraj.

- Taylor’s Fallacy of Speed was also summarised in Indian Opinion (CW 10: 379). Divided into three short chapters – ‘Speed and population’, ‘Speed and profit’ and ‘Speed and pleasure’ – the book challenges the prevailing assumption that ‘faster is better’. He had in mind the railways (see Hind Swaraj, ch. IX), the shift of population from rural areas to new ugly, urban centres, the dwindling of opportunities for leisure and relaxation. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=646))
- Taylor reaches the pessimistic conclusion that ‘on the whole’ healthy conditions are less readily available under the reign of speed than they were under the reign of a slower pace: ‘there is something about the age in which we live which militates against leisure in considerable sections of the community ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=650))
- Pessimism is never normative to Hind Swaraj; on the contrary, the book is hopeful that the advent of a moral revolution in the hearts and minds of the rich and the powerful, i. e., the advent of real swaraj, would still be a possibility. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00E3UR6X2&location=680))
- His Principles of Civil Disobedience was paraphrased and published in 1907 in Indian Opinion. He was heartened to read that conscience, not majorities, should have the ultimate say in judging what is politically right and wrong, that while it is not one’s duty to eradicate evil, it is certainly one’s first duty not to give support to it, that even one person’s action counts although the multitude may be opposed to it, that in an unjust political regime the prison is the right place for the just person, that only that state is worthy of obedience which recognises the just individual ‘as a higher and independent power’ from which the state’s own power is ultimately derived.

- He would have agreed with Thoreau’s dicta that politics without virtue is ‘a kind of vegetation’, that good manners cannot be a substitute for civic virtue. What modern politics lacks and what it needs most is ‘a high and earnest purpose’, and an appreciation for ‘culture more than for potatoes’.

- The 1903 edition, first series, available in South Africa, contained such essays as ‘History’, ‘Self-reliance’, ‘Spiritual laws’, ‘Heroism’, ‘The over-soul’, and ‘Art’. In any case, Gandhi saw in Emerson’s essays, as he put it, ‘the teaching of Indian wisdom in a Western garb’ (ibid.).

- The soul is the indestructible, non-material, eternal substance whose essence is consciousness, knowledge, bliss and freedom. God is but the soul in its absolute perfection. Humans, being caught in their bodily existence, are in need of liberation from passions, which is attainable only through rigorous asceticism, self-purification and withdrawal from the world.
