- 1903 to 1914, and again from 1919 to 1948, he published weekly newspapers in Gujarati and in English. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=148))
- with his views on politics and society (and much else) being articulated in periodicals owned or at least controlled by himself. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=152))
- We are asked to choose between rule by foreigners and self-rule, between violence and non-violence, between the aggressive proselytizing of one’s faith and the loving understanding of another, between a respect for natural systems and an arrogant disregard of them. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=212))
- The great rush to colonize and claim South Africa took place at roughly the same time as the westward expansion of the United States. The attractions of open territory, of fabulous natural wealth (and natural beauty), of escape from an over-populated and class-ridden Old World – these were what the two processes of economic migration had in common. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=236))
- this additional complicating factor – the presence of Indians from India, who were not indigenous but emphatically not European either. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=239))
- It was in this strange scenario that Gandhi came to acquire, and practise, his four major callings – those of freedom fighter, social reformer, religious pluralist and prophet. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=241))
- Gandhi gave the name ‘satyagraha’ (or truth-force) to the techniques of mass civil disobedience he invented in South Africa and later used in India, ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=248))
- The distinctiveness of Gandhi’s method lay in shaming the rulers by voluntary suffering, with resisters seeking beatings and imprisonment by breaking laws in a non-violent yet utterly determined manner. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=250))
- By coming to South Africa, Gandhi was taken out of this conservative, static world into a country still in the process of being made. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=274))
- in both city and countryside, they rarely came into daily competition with the British or the Boers. There were few African traders, and still fewer African doctors or lawyers. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=294))
- Because they were better educated and better organized, some Indians could more actively challenge the facts of white domination. The rulers responded by changing the laws: by disallowing Indians from living in or opening shops in certain locations, from moving from one province to another, from seeking admission to the best schools, from importing brides from India with whom they could raise families and thus bring more Indians into the workforce. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=295))
- Gandhi’s South African campaigns were an early example of ‘diasporic nationalism’, a nationalism later practised assiduously by (among others) Irishmen in Boston, Jews in New York, Palestinians in Tunis and Sikhs in Vancouver, who have likewise struggled both for civil rights in the land they happened now to live in and for freedom for their compatriots in the land they had left behind. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=305))
- Should immigrants be allowed to practise their own faith and speak their own language? How can they combat discrimination in school and in the workplace? What forms of political organization are best suited to their needs and hopes? What are the rights and responsibilities of the host community and the migrants respectively, in maintaining social peace and democracy?

- Their traditional occupation was trade and moneylending. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=322))
- The code of the caste stressed ‘hard work and frugal living’. Thus ‘Baniyas were taught never to be idle, and they had in consequence a reputation for being a restless people, irritated when there was no work at hand’. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=332))
- In Hindu states or kingdoms, the second most important person was the Diwan, or chief minister. This key post was almost always taken by a member of the two highest castes, Brahmin and Kshatriya. Not so in Kathiawar, where members of the merchant caste could aspire to become chief ministers. Among the many Bania Diwans in Kathiawar were Mohandas Gandhi’s own father and grandfather. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=352))
- Porbandar was one of some seventy chiefdoms in Kathiawar. So many states in such a small territory encouraged a proliferation in titles. Many rulers called themselves ‘Maharaja’ if they were Hindu, and ‘Nawab’ if they were Muslim. Others used more exotic titles such as ‘Rao’ and ‘Jam Saheb’. The ruler of Porbandar was known as the ‘Rana’. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=370))
- 86 per cent of Kathiawaris were Hindus, ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=377))
- from the Hindu fold in about the ninth century BC. The Parsis, also known as Zoroastrians, had fled to India from Persia after the rise to power in that land of the Shia branch of Islam. The Jains and the Parsis, adding to the heterogeneity of Kathiawar, were both admired for their scholarship and business acumen. The Jains were further respected for their austere personal lives; the Parsis, for their easy emulation of Western manners and mores. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=384))
- Unlike in eastern or southern India, the British did not choose to rule over Kathiawar directly. About 80 per cent of the peninsula remained with Indian rulers. These potentates were tolerated, so long as they recognized the military and political superiority of the British, and allowed them to monitor trade and the movement of people. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=388))
- The states of Kathiawar were divided into four geographical divisions, each with a British agent, to whom the chiefs reported. Some towns had British garrisons; others, British railway engineers or Christian missionaries. Detachments of troops led by white officers visited ports and towns at subtle intervals. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=394))
- was broadcast to his 70,000 subjects, among them the Gandhis, a family that for several generations had been in the service of the state. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=399))

- Since the aquifer under Porbandar was brackish, it was necessary to harvest and husband rainwater. Before the monsoon, the roof of the Gandhi home was cleaned. Then as the rain ran down it was purified by some lime, attached to the mouth of a pipe which linked the roof to the water tank below. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=458))
- The American scholar Stephen Hay points out that Mohandas’s mother ‘would have had to develop a good deal of patience and forbearance as a young bride, for her husband’s other wife, whom she had in a sense displaced, was both ill and barren, and the two lived under the same roof for some ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=470))
- the merchant castes looked down on ‘what they saw as the dirty and degrading eating habits of most non-Baniyas’. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=477))
- The sub-caste the Gandhis belonged to was known as Modh Bania, the prefix apparently referring to the town of Modhera, in southern Gujarat. Their kul devata, or family deity, was Ram. There was a Ram temple in Porbandar. (One of the temple’s founders was a Gandhi.) The region was steeped in the traditions of Vaishnavism, the worship of Vishnu and especially his avatars Ram and Krishna. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=493))
- Gandhi remembered being married at the age of thirteen), ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=580))
- his successful conquest of the Bombay Matriculation had already made Mohandas one of the best educated young men in the Peninsula. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=669))
- There existed, among orthodox Hindus, a horror of travel abroad, of losing caste by crossing the polluting ocean, the kala pani. Among Banias the prejudice was even more intense, since outside India they found it hard to maintain the strict food taboos that regulated their lives. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=676))
- The shortfall would be made up by pawning the family jewellery. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=695))
- drink wine, or eat meat. The elders were unmoved. For his transgression, the boy would be treated as an outcaste; anyone who spoke to him or went to see him off would be fined. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=713))
- London in 1888 was a great international city. No city in the world had more people – about 6 million in all, twice the number in Paris – or more nationalities represented in them. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=765))

- This too sought to usher in socialism, albeit by British – that is to say gradualist – methods. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=842))
- to become vegetarian, he argued, was not to deny oneself anything, but simply to share the joy of kinship with the non-human world. The raison d’être of vegetarianism was ‘the growing sense that flesh-eating is a cruel, disgusting, unwholesome, and wasteful practice’. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=867))
- For Salt, vegetarians were the moral vanguard of the human race. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=874))
- The young Gandhi had little interest in the two great popular passions of late nineteenth-century London, the theatre and sport.25 Imperial and socialist politics left him cold. However, in the weekly meetings of the vegetarians of London he found a cause, and his first English friends. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=885))

- Moving further outwards from his native Hinduism, Gandhi began reading Christian texts, supplied to him by a vegetarian from Manchester. The Book of Genesis sent him to sleep, but the New Testament he found compelling. The Sermon on the Mount in particular ‘went straight to my heart’. The lines about offering one’s cloak to the man who had taken away one’s coat touched him greatly. Comparing it to the Gita, he concluded that both taught that ‘renunciation was the highest form of religion’. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=909))
- He calculated that he walked an average of eight miles a day. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=925))
- ‘Unlike the English, the Indians do not take each dish separately, but they mix many things together.’ Moreover, ‘each dish is elaborately prepared. In fact, they don’t believe in plain boiled vegetables, but must have them flavoured with plenty of condiments, e.g., pepper, salt, cloves, turmeric, mustard seed, and various other things for which it would be difficult to find English names unless they be those used in medicine.’ ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=959))
- Gandhi’s involvement with the vegetarians of London was far more important to him than is commonly recognized. Had he not joined their Society, he would have kept to his compatriots, as Indian students abroad were wont to do at the time (and sometimes still are). These first, close friendships with English people expanded his mind and his personality. He learnt to relate to people of different races and religious beliefs, to mix, mingle and eat with them, and even to share a home with them. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=993))
- The first Indians had sailed for Natal thirty-three years before Gandhi did. They were a group of indentured labourers brought in to work on the sugar plantations. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1260))
- The climate and soil of Natal were ideal for growing sugar; the problem, however, was that Africans were unwilling to spare time from their fields to work as labourers. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1269))
- He was booked on a first-class coach. Two hours later, when the train was at Pietermaritzburg station, a railway official asked him to move to a third-class compartment. When Gandhi protested that he had a valid ticket, a constable was summoned to take him and his luggage off the train. From the station he sent two telegrams, one to the railway authorities, the other to Dada Abdulla. The latter sent word to the Indian merchants in Pietermaritzburg, who came to the station to comfort Gandhi with their own stories of being discriminated against in the past. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1337))
- He reached the end of the line at Charlestown, and took a stagecoach on to Johannesburg. The white coachman refused to let him sit inside, on the padded seats reserved for paying passengers. When he protested – for he had, again, a valid ticket – the man boxed his ears. Gandhi hung on dangerously to the rails, before getting off, voluntarily, at the first stop, Standerton, where he was – once more – met and consoled by the town’s Indian merchants. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1341))
- For if the Vedas were the inspired Word of God, why could not the Bible and the Koran claim to be likewise? He began to read Christian and Islamic texts, furthering his knowledge, and perhaps also his confusion. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1367))
- In September 1893 an Anti-Asiatic League was formed to disallow Indians from voting. There were, at this time, a mere 10,729 eligible voters in Natal. All but a handful were European. To maintain white dominance, the vote had to be restricted to the ruling race. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1381))
- A few Indian merchants were on the electoral rolls, by virtue of the property they owned. The white League asked judges to disenfranchise them, since ‘the Asiatic population of Natal is already larger than the European and if the former are to have access to the franchise, then it will only be a few years until the latter are completely out-voted. Then our children will have cause to curse us for our enormous folly’. ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1384))
- Dada Abdulla threw a farewell dinner, at which the discussion turned to a bill before the Natal Assembly, that would prohibit Indians from enrolling as voters. Abdulla’s guests wanted the legislation to be fought, and Gandhi, the lawyer and English-speaker, to stay on and assist them. The ‘farewell party was turned into a working committee’ to plan the resistance to the bill. So long as Gandhi stayed in Durban, said the merchants, they would pay him an annual retainer. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1424))
- a law whereby all except Europeans had to carry a pass when out in the streets at night. Traders complained they were not permitted to sell goods on Sunday – the day their main clients, the indentured labourers, were off work – and not allowed to open shops in the city centre. ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1432))
- The entrepreneurial skills of the Indians, and their desire for self-improvement, posed a problem for the neat racial order the rulers wished to impose on Natal. ([Location 1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1462))
- Not yet twenty-five, a Gujarati educated in London who had been but a year in South Africa, Gandhi had now become the leader of the Natal Indians. ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1504))
- From the European point of view, if ‘the Indian vote grew in number and in strength’ a ‘condition of chronic racial dissension would be unavoidable’, as Natalians who were not white sought a greater share of political and administrative power. ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1511))
- a transformative process whereby he moved from orthodoxy to heterodoxy in religion, from lawyering to activism in professional life and from a conservative inland Indian town (Rajkot) to a growing, bustling South African port (Durban).

- The Kingsford–Maitland view of Christianity appealed to Gandhi because it asked not for exaltation of a personal Saviour, but fidelity to one’s conscience. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1642))

- Tolstoy’s book reinforced his own heterodoxy, his stubborn insistence on forging a spiritual path for himself regardless of churches and creeds whether Hindu or Christian. Meanwhile, Gandhi was also rereading the Gita, which he saw less as a celebration of a ‘just war’ and more as a manifesto for ethical conduct, advocating indifference to love and hate, attachment and possession. ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1668))
- Spiritual equanimity was the essence of self-realization. Anger, conceit, deceit and greed were its adversaries. ([Location 1682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1682))

- There, apart from being denied the franchise, Indians were also forbidden to own property and trade in their own names. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=1878))

- The first allowed the colony to deport passengers coming from places where plague or other epidemics currently raged. The second declared as a ‘prohibited immigrant’ anyone who could not sign his name in a European language. The third gave town boards the liberty to deny or refuse to renew trading licences to those who did not keep their books in English, or whose premises were ‘unprovided with proper and sufficient sanitary arrangements’. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=2416))
- While the British coveted the coast – which provided access to their jewel in the east, India – the Boers had possession of these inland territories. In the 1850s they formed two, semi-autonomous, republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal (the latter also known, from the 1880s, as the South African Republic). ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=2547))
- One consequence of the war between Boer and Briton was the flight of Indians from the South African Republic. ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=2615))
- At this meeting, too, Gandhi was given an array of jewels. These included a diamond ring presented on behalf of the community as a whole, a gold necklace subscribed for by Gujarati Hindus, a diamond pin from Abdul Cadir and a gold watch offered by Dada Abdulla and Company.51 Gandhi accepted the presents (and the compliments), but three days later he wrote to Parsee Rustomjee saying he was returning the gifts. He wished to make them over to the Natal Indian Congress, to form an emergency fund for times of crisis. ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=2782))
- Gandhi was beginning to view his new mentor in the same light, for, as he observed, ‘to see Gokhale at work was as much a joy as an education. He never wasted a minute. His private relations and friendships were all for [the] public good.’ ([Location 2852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=2852))

- This new, syncretic, cosmopolitan creed was at odds with the prevailing ethos of a city displaying ‘the concentrated essence of selfishness, individualism, greed and mammon worship’. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=3152))
- Rugby, cricket and horse-racing held no attractions for Gandhi; nor did club life and hunting expeditions. But experiments in diet and inter-faith living did. These interests or obsessions, first visible in London, were now more vigorously pursued amidst Jews, Theosophists, Nonconformists and vegetarians in this new city on a reef. ([Location 3211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=3211))
- he wrote that the lives of Christ and Joan of Arc demonstrated that ‘individuals have to sacrifice so that the community may gain a great deal’. Gandhi thought the situation did not call for ‘heroic sacrifice’ by Indians; rather, ‘well-sustained, continuous and temperate constitutional effort is the main thing needed.’ ([Location 3254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=3254))
- John Ruskin’s Unto This Last. This was a polemic against the then very influential science of political economy. Ruskin deplored the tendency of Ricardo, Mill, et al. to make money the unit of all exchange and value. A science that regarded air, light and cleanliness, or peace, trust and love as worthless, was in conflict with the teachings of the great religions, and antithetical to the deeper interests of humanity itself. Whereas Ricardo and company rigorously separated economics from morality, Ruskin thought that affection and trust must govern relations between master and servant, capitalist and worker. A moral economics would be one ‘which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings’, not which promoted the greatest monetary wealth or produced the greatest number of rich people. ([Location 3376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=3376))
- The impact was so immense that, as Gandhi later recalled, ‘I determined to change my life in accordance with the ideals of the book.’ The core teaching of Unto This Last, as understood by him, was that the work of farmers and labourers was as valuable as the work of lawyers and factory managers. To work with one’s hands, and on the land, was more honourable than working with one’s brains or with the aid of machines.

- with her in Johannesburg, and so it turned out. He rose early, helped his wife grind flour for the day’s meals, then walked the five miles to his office in Rissik Street, carrying a packed lunch of wholemeal bread with peanut butter and a selection of seasonal fruits.

- Gandhi began with Hinduism, which, he argued, rested on three pillars: the importance of caste in social matters; the importance of pantheism in religious matters; and the importance of self-denial in ethical matters. Gandhi referred in passing to the rise and fall of Buddhism in India, and also mentioned Jainism, whose ‘most remarkable characteristic was its scrupulous regard for all things that lived’. ([Location 3499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=3499))
- In October 1905, the Bengal Presidency was divided. The eastern part of Bengal was predominantly Muslim; by making it a separate province, the British hoped to wean Muslims away from the Hindu-dominated Indian National Congress. The partition provoked a great outcry – especially among the middle classes in Calcutta, angry that their province was cut in half.

- A hartal refers to the withdrawal of support and services from the state, or from one’s employers. Among the various forms it took, and takes, were workers laying down tools to demand larger wages, peasants migrating from a kingdom to protest high taxes and shopkeepers closing their shutters to protest a new tax.

- He had come round to the view that ‘there is no impassable barrier between East and West’; rather, there was one between ancient and modern civilization.

- Thus, if two brothers quarrelled, their neighbours and the newspapers, and hence history, would take notice of it; but if they peaceably settled their dispute, it would remain unrecorded. Extrapolating, Gandhi said, in a striking passage, that ‘hundreds of nations live in peace. History does not, and cannot, take note of this fact. History is really a record of every interruption of the even working of love or of the soul.’ Contrary to what was popularly believed, non-violence had been a far more active force in human affairs than violence. The ‘greatest and most unimpeachable evidence of the success of this force is to be found in the fact that, in spite of the wars of the world, it still lives on’.

- bloodshed can never make India independent though by the way he calls Dhingra a true patriot, ‘but his patriotism was mad’. ‘But’, says the Reader, ‘you must admit that what little has been granted by Lord Morley is owing to these political murders’. ‘It is quite possible’, says the ‘Editor’, ‘that what Lord Morley has granted has been granted through fear. But what has been gained through fear can be retained only so long as that fear lasts.’ Therefore he advocates peaceful means, and among them ‘passive resistance’.

- Pranjivan Mehta was to Mohandas Gandhi what Friedrich Engels was to Karl Marx: at once a disciple and a patron, who saw, very early, that the friend of his youth had the makings of the heroic, world-transforming figure he was to later become. Their friendship was consolidated by a shared language and culture – it mattered that Engels and Marx were both Germans, and that Mehta and Gandhi were both Gujaratis. There were differences: Engels believed Marx would redeem a class (the proletariat); Mehta believed Gandhi would save a nation, India. Both, however, had a deep, almost unquestioning faith in their compatriot’s genius. Both were prepared to reach deep into their pockets to activate and enable it.19 ([Location 8125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=8125))
- The letter concisely captures Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violent resistance to unjust laws.

- The resemblances in their political views are striking. The African reformer and the Indian reformer both practised – and preached – a principled incrementalism. Their opposition to racial prejudice was unswerving, yet they thought – or hoped – that a combination of patience and courtesy would make their adversaries see reason and finally dispense justice.

- He thought bad air to be the cause of most diseases. Dirty latrines and open-air urination fouled the atmosphere, as did the casual dumping of food peelings and garbage, and spitting – all practices common to Indians.

- Gandhi’s response was to fast for a whole week; after it ended, he would have only one meal a day for a year. That latter vow he had wanted to take after witnessing the violence against the miners; dissuaded by Kallenbach, he now took it as a mark of his pain at being let down by his son and his ward, and also as atonement for what he felt was his inadequate and incomplete supervision.

- In India itself, the idea that women could participate in popular social movements was out of the question. Middle-class women, whether Hindu or Muslim, were not expected to mix socially with members of the other sex. The only men they spoke to were family members, or servants, or itinerant traders who came knocking at their door. They were not supposed to leave the house unescorted.

- He urged them to treat members of other communities like guests in their house.

- Religion implies, for him, a mighty and all-embracing tolerance, and a large charity is the first of the virtues. Hindu by birth, he regards all men – Mahomedans, Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Buddhists, Confucians – as spiritual brothers. He makes no differences amongst them, recognising that all faiths lead to salvation, that all are ways of viewing God, and that, in their relation to each other, men are fellow-human beings first, and followers of creeds afterwards. Hence it is that men of all faiths and even of none, are his devoted friends, admirers, and helpers. ([Location 10340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=10340))

- Mahadev Govind Ranade, had urged on his largely Brahmin audience a ‘new mode of thought … cast on the lines of fraternity, a capacity to expand outwards, and to make more cohesive inwards the bonds of fellowship’.

- the American journalist Edgar Snow went to meet Mao Zedong after the latter’s Long March. Snow was coming from India, where he had met and come to admire Gandhi. The Mahatma was by this time a figure of great world renown, especially in America, where he figured often in the New York Times and had been chosen by Time Magazine as their Man of the Year (in 1930, after his own Long March to break the salt laws). The Chinese revolutionary and the American journalist discussed the Indian path to political freedom. Mao was dismissive, since, unlike the Chinese Communists, Gandhi had not undertaken an agrarian revolution by forcibly dispossessing large landlords.

- If, in 1904, Milner had agreed to legalize the existing rights of Indian traders in the Transvaal, Gandhi would have returned home without ever having thought of civil disobedience.

- saw him as ‘reactionary and obscurantist’ because he used a religious idiom rather than a secular-scientific one, because he preached a moderation of material wants rather than welcoming the cornucopian promises of modernity, because he advocated the (to them) tame, timid, effeminate alternative of satyagraha to the militant, masculine route of armed struggle.

- To simplify his diet, to reduce his dependence on medicines and doctors, to embrace brahmacharya, were all for him ways of strengthening his will and his resolve. By conquering the need to be stimulated by sex or rich food – the ‘basal passions’ according to his teacher Tolstoy – Gandhi was preparing himself for a life lived for other people and for higher values. If he ate little, and that merely fruits and vegetables, without salt, sugar and spices; if he didn’t care how often (or if at all) he had sex with his wife (or with others); if he dressed simply and didn’t own property or jewellery, he could more easily embrace the rigours of prison life, more fully and whole-heartedly devote his being and his body to the oppressed Indians of Natal and the Transvaal.

([Location 10644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=10644))
- Gandhi was both a practitioner and a theorist of satyagraha. He planned his campaigns meticulously. Which law was to be broken when, by whom, in which place and in what manner – to these matters he gave careful attention and issued precise instructions. Before and after these campaigns he explained the wider moral and political significance of satyagraha. ([Location 10650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=10650))
- A. M. Cachalia observed that ‘the passive resister is higher in the moral scale, and in that of human development than the active resister … Passive resistance is a matter of heart, of conscience, of trained understanding.’ Speaking to a reporter in Durban in September 1910, Henry Polak observed that ‘our programme will remain, as it has always been, not one of violence or attempts to disturb, but one of suffering on the part of our people, who intend to go on enduring these hardships until they make the authorities ashamed of themselves.’ ([Location 10667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G8EKYGC&location=10667))
