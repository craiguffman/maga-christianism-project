### Highlights

- This book is an attempt to make sense of, on the one hand, the intersection between Christianity, place, and identity, and on the other, the relationship between church, civil society, the market, and the state. Understanding the relationship between church, civil society, the market, and the state is vital for addressing the central questions that dominate contemporary politics, namely: What are the limits of the state? What are the limits of money? And what are the limits of community? ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=221))

- questions. Some respond by letting the church be construed by the modern bureaucratic state as either one more interest group seeking a share of public money or just another constituency within civil society which can foster social cohesion and make up the deficiencies of the welfare state. The former reduces the church to a client of the state’s patronage and the latter co-opts the church in a new form of establishment, one where the state sets the terms and conditions of, and thence controls, the relationship.

- Another response is for Christians to construe themselves as part of an identity politics. This entails reframing Christian political witness in terms of either multiculturalism – the church becoming just another minority identity group demanding recognition for its way of life as equally valid in relation to all others – or the rhetoric of rights the church decomposing itself into a collective of rights – bearing individuals pursuing freedom of religious expression. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=232))
- third response is to let Christianity be construed by the market as a product to be consumed or commodity to be bought and sold so that in the religious marketplace Christianity is simply another privatized lifestyle choice, interchangeable with or equivalent to any other.

- An additional reason to turn to Augustine is that historically we stand in a context analogous to his own. As Graham Ward notes: “Poised as [Augustine] was on the threshold between radical pluralism (which he called paganism) and the rise of Christendom, we stand on the other side of that history: at the end of Christendom and the re-emergence of radical (as distinct from liberal) pluralism.” ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=264))

- Augustine divides human societies in two: there is the city of God – which combines both the true church in this age and the New Jerusalem of the age to come – and Babylon or the earthly city.2 Augustine characterizes the division not as a division within society but as a division between societies. These two cities are understood as two polities coexistent in one space and time: the time before Christ’s return. Citizens of both cities seek peace; however, in the earthly city peace is achieved through the imposition of one’s own will by the exercise of force, and is at once costly in its creation,3 lacking in real justice,4 and unstable in its existence.5 For Augustine, the only true society and true peace exist in the city of God.

- when the prophet Jeremiah foretold the captivity which was to befall the ancient People of God, he bade them, by divine command, to go obediently into Babylon, thereby serving God even by their patient endurance, and he himself admonished them to pray for Babylon, saying “in the peace thereof shall ye have peace”: the temporal peace which is for the time being shared by the good and the wicked alike.

- dynamics of co-option, competition, and commodification, it is the contention of this book that practices such as Fair Trade or broad-based community organizing are ways in which the church pursues the peace of Babylon, all the time recognizing that this peace is a contingent, relative, and earthly peace. As a whole, the book attempts to hold up a mirror to the churches so they might discern patterns of faithful witness amid the earthly city and recognize when they are motivated more by pride or self-love than by love of God and neighbor.

- the Israelites were to learn obedience through pursuing the welfare of Babylon and through forming a common life with pagans and oppressors. Jeremiah’s call to seek the welfare of Babylon comes to a defeated, subjugated, and marginal people struggling to make sense of what has happened to them.11 In many ways that is the situation of Christians today: the church no longer has priority and Christians are not in control. The salience of Jeremiah 29 is its call to become part of the public life of the city and to reject the false prophets who perpetuate illusions of escape into a private world of gated communities, religious fantasies centered on Christ’s immanent return, or daydreams of revolution; while at the same time, Jeremiah warns us not give way to a despairing fatalism that believes nothing will ever change.

- On Yoder’s reading Jesus and the early church follow the Jeremianic pattern of not orienting themselves to the world politically or militarily so as to regain control or be in charge, but missiologically, so as to bear faithful witness.15 Such a missiological orientation implies neither withdrawal nor subcultural resistance but, as exemplified in the stories of Joseph, Daniel, and Esther, entails combining active investment in Babylon’s wellbeing with faithful particularity and obedience to God.

- in the words of Yoder’s suggestive translation of Jeremiah 29.7, it entails seeking “the salvation of the culture to which God has sent you.”16 On this account we discover at the heart of Easter the theo-logic of Jeremiah 29: that the way of the cross, the journey into exile, is the beginning of new life and new hope.17 As will be seen, Jeremiah 29 is a leitmotif of this book and a key text for framing my account of Christian political witness in the contemporary context.

These take the form of social movements, subcultures, and fluid political alliances that respond both to the increasing risks of the modernization process and the industrial and administrative interference in the realm of the personal.29 Existing political institutions (for example, parliament) lose currency as people begin to construct their political and social lives differently and what was previously considered apolitical becomes highly politicized.

- Confirming this evaluation, Rodney Stark argues that not only was the secularization thesis mistaken, it was based on false presuppositions about a previous “age of faith” that never existed, and was blind to the remarkable stability and, in places, increase of religious adherence since 1800 in Europe and elsewhere.

- society must at some point have been in a ‘secular’ state.” Yet it is arguable that in terms of religious adherence and the public significance of religion we never lived in a “secular age” even if, as Charles Taylor argues, we do now live in an age when religious belief has become a self-reflexive act. Taylor gives three meanings to the term “secular”: The first denotes a decline in the public role of religion and the second posits a “falling off” in religious adherence. The third refers to the conditions of belief whereby belief in God moves from being a given to becoming “one option among others.”58 For Taylor, this third development was itself a partially religious development rather than an inevitable outcome of processes of modernization. This third meaning of the term does have traction. For Taylor, our “secular age” is characterized neither by a necessary decline in religious belief nor by an incompatibility between religion and modernity, but by a plurality of forms of belief and unbelief which are themselves constantly interacting and changing. On this account, secularism and the secularity of both particular institutions, such as a university, and of a society are as much the result of dynamics and discourses within Christianity as the fruit of external pressures.

- However, the three most prominent ones are the following: new patterns of immigration are changing the religious demography of Western liberal democracies such that there is greater and deeper religious diversity (albeit in limited, mostly urban pockets); the events of September 11, 2001, the “war on terror,” and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to an increased consciousness of Islam as a world religion and political force and raised questions about whether tolerance is an adequate response to religious diversity; and the state is increasingly situating itself as a partner, not a provider of social welfare services, which in turn is creating new opportunities for and new forms of engagement between religious groups, the state, and the market.

- The contemporary context may be described as a postsecularist space as far as the state and certain elite groups are concerned, but it is better understood overall as a period in which, for the first time, multiple modernities, each with their respective relationship to religious belief and practice, are overlapping and interacting within the same shared, predominantly urban spaces. Within such interactions, existing binary oppositions, such as secular and religious, tolerant and intolerant, public and private, conservative and radical, and left and right, that tend to frame political relationships break down. Yet incommensurable otherness remains to be negotiated within a shared territory in pursuit of goods in common.

    - **Note:** record this in key concepts
- What we might call postsecularist moments can be viewed as part of the normative condition of the church as it seeks to bear faithful witness within the ambiguous, undetermined time of the saeculum, wherein both “Christians” and “non-Christians” are constituted in their personhood by the earthly city and the city of God, where both the church and those various others with whom it must negotiate an earthly peace are capable of good and evil, pride and love, and where there is often a hazy boundary between church and non-church. This theologically defined understanding of the secular/saeculum ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=573))
- it is necessary to locate it in a specific theological conversation about the relationship between Christianity and politics. It is this conversation that lies at the heart of the book. A key problem in contemporary Christian political thought is whether the church has a distinctive politics and is itself a particular polity or whether it is best understood as a constituency within civil society whose politics takes the form of democratization and a commitment to a liberal state.

- a growing number of theologians have emphasized that the first task of the church is to be a church. For them, it is not the business of the church to invest itself in one particular form of temporal political order – namely liberal democracy. In the view of one of the most prominent exponents of this critique, Stanley Hauerwas, the church has its own politics and should refrain from turning to the state as the first or only way of addressing social and political problems.65 As will be set out in Chapter 1, the move toward a “theological politics” can also characterize the work of John Milbank, William Cavanaugh, and Oliver and Joan Lockwood O’Donovan. Figures such as Milbank, Cavanaugh, and the O’Donovans rightly contend that the church cannot simply derive an understanding of its political vision from outside of Christian belief and practice. In turn, they each conceptualize a particular relationship between the church, the state, and the market, and in one way or another, they envisage different aspects of Christian worship as a counter-performance of social and political relationships to those conditioned by the modern state and the capitalist economy.

- The focus on how Christians are already acting politically makes no inherent claim for a first-order theory of practice. Rather, it is simply an attempt to conceptualize the relationship between church, state, and market through attention to the givenness of what is already going on; that is, to the reality of existent political relationships. In attending to such practices we may discover that the already existing forms of action are suggestive of alternative ways of framing faithful witness than are currently available in contemporary Christian political thought.

- The book delineates various ways in which the church contributes to judgment about such goods in common at a local, national, and global level. To do this, I map the interrelationship between different theological responses to liberal democracy – ranging from Niebuhr and Maritain to Milbank and Hauerwas – and concrete forms of political action within the contemporary context. Out of attention to this interaction an account is developed of what the faithful pursuit of Babylon’s peace may involve.

- judgment is understood as having the double, simultaneous aspect of discrimination and decision. Following O’Donovan’s analysis of judgment, such just or right judgment has a retrospective element (as an act of discrimination it pronounces upon an existent state of affairs) and as a decision it has a prospective aspect (it is effective in establishing or clearing a space for a common field of action in which moral relations are possible). Oliver O’Donovan, The Ways of Judgement (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 7–12. I draw on O’Donovan’s account of judgment because it is the fullest account available of political judgment that takes seriously what it means to make judgments in a sinful world after the exaltation of Jesus Christ. Thus, while it is alive to the concerns and developments of the accounts of judgment given by Kant and Arendt (although both of their accounts of political judgment are at best fragmentary), it is a fully theological account of political judgment.

In short, government policy, far from contributing to social cohesion, can undermine its stated aim through the way it structures its relations with FDGs. However, the deleterious impact of its policy is masked because any conflict that arises is subsequently interpreted through the Enlightenment critique of religion as a source of division - religion is the chaos monster - and no attention is given to how such division is itself a result of state-induced competition.

- Oliver O’Donovan is often misunderstood as advocating that some form of Christendom is a necessary political project of the church. This is not the case. Rather, for O’Donovan, the church engages in mission, eschewing any imperialistic or totalizing political project, yet in response to this mission something Christendom-like may emerge at the point where rulers seek to bow the knee to the Lordship of Christ. Against the likes of Hauerwas, O’Donovan is content with such an eventuality as right and proper and as not something to be ashamed of where it has occurred in the history of the church.

- While highly disturbing of polite society, it is within the law and any attempt to act against the group would make a mockery of the authorities. It would be very funny, ridiculing the establishment, while at the same time highlighting the racism of the status quo by physically placing poor blacks in an exclusive environment frequented only by whites. It was completely outside the experience of the establishment while within the experience and abilities of the people. As Alinsky puts it: “The one thing that all oppressed people want to do to their oppressors is shit on them.”36 Yet at the same time, it recognizes that the alien and formal surroundings of the concert hall would intimidate the blacks, so the measure involves involuntary physical action that overcomes any reticence on the part of the participants. The merit of the action would be in the reaction of the racist ladies-who-lunch berating their executive husbands who worked at Eastman Kodak to do something to stop the fouling up of “their” concert hall.37 ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=2229))

- There is a growing scholarly consensus that, for Augustine, while political authority is not neutral (it is either directed toward or away from God), the saeculum (the time between Christ’s ascension and his return) is open, ambivalent, and undetermined.52 Augustine’s eschatology constitutes a response to both Constantinian triumphalism (marked by an expectation of progress until the church would overcome the world and universally display heaven’s glory in history) and Donatist separatism from the world (wherein history is oriented toward regress or a movement away from God).

- Citizenship is the currency that the city of God and the earthly city share within the mutual ground of the saeculum.

- With Aristotle, Augustine can say that humans are naturally social animals who find fulfillment in a polity of some kind. Against Aristotle, and much other political thought, he argues that the political societies we see around us, and thus the form citizenship takes in them, are neither natural nor fulfilling because they are fallen and oriented away from the true end of human beings communion with God - and toward their own prideful, self-destructive ends. ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=2332))

- At its minimum, political witness, on the basis of Augustine’s framework, is about negotiating what is necessary for a tolerable earthly peace to exist within which the Gospel can be preached and which the city of God makes use of for a time.

- As will be argued through the course of this book, forming common objects of love between the citizens of the two cities is a necessary condition of faithful witness to the Lordship of Christ over all things.

- Thus the church, far from constituting an alternative society, is either a threat to the liberal democratic order, or it is subsumed to the demands of the liberal democratic order so that they share the same aim: the humanization of social, economic, and political life. In effect, the church becomes an adjunct to the prevailing social order in the name of maintaining a proximate justice.102 It is at this point that the continuing legacy of Niebuhr can be seen in ongoing discussions of the relationship between Christianity and politics that tacitly subsume the church to either the needs of the prevailing political order or to an immanent project of humanization. Such an approach gives up any hope of the Spirit acting to irrupt anticipations and glimpses of the eschaton within the saeculum and renounces its vocation to bear witness to the world as it is in Christ within the world turned in on itself.

- What has emerged through Alinsky’s approach is a way for churches to overcome the privatization of religion in modern liberal politics (as outlined in Chapter 1). It enables churches to deploy their own language and symbols rather than having to translate them into some form of “public reason,” subscribe to a mediating democratic creed, or adopt wholesale the languages of either “progressive” or “conservative” politics.

Just as our love of God begins with listening to God’s Word, the beginning of love for other Christians is learning to listen to them. God’s love for us is shown by the fact that God not only gives us God’s Word, but also lends us God’s ear. We do God’s work for our brothers and sisters when we learn to listen to them.

- the practice of hospitality is more often than not undertaken in a situation where one party is in a position of strength and the other in a position of vulnerability or weakness. There may be forms of reciprocity but undergirding it is an asymmetry of relationship. This points to the insight of Georg Simmel, who in his essay The Stranger noted that the stranger is not one who is geographically distant from us; that is to be in a situation of non-relation (Georg Simmel, The Sociology of Georg Simmel, trans. Kurt H. Wolff (New York: Free Press, 1950), pp. 402–8). Strangers are those with whom we share the same space but who are different from us. They are constituted by a coordination of simultaneous nearness and distance. Hence, as Simmel points out, the European Jews were the paradigmatic stranger. However, this is now the situation of everyone in plural, liberal democratic polities wherein multiple modernities coincide. We encounter strangers (be they people of other religious traditions, of different cultures) in schools, hospitals, political institutions, and even in our households.

- Two temptations seem to beset members of liberal polities when they meet the stranger. First, we can objectify the other, creating a form of abstract relationship by which to manage and coordinate relations between generalized others in order that we never really meet concrete others. This is, in effect, what Rawls’s conception of public reason does. Second, we are tempted to take advantage of our strength as an opportunity to exclude (as nationalists do) or demand some form of tribute (as those who demand assimilation do). By contrast, a Christian account of hospitality, while often not practiced, does demand making room for the vulnerable other a priority and hold open the possibility of a new form of life emerging through the interaction.

- the formulation of a just and generous refugee policy goes back to Augustine’s account of what constitutes a true res publica. For Augustine, it is the ends or loves of the polity that form the basis of its common life. Thus the difference between the earthly city and the city of God rests in their different ends or objects of love.50 An earthly city cannot be a true res publica because the nature of its loves means that it can never be a truly harmonious society; rather, it always involves individual and group competition and hostility. For Augustine, the politics of any instance of the earthly city is about negotiating what is necessary for a tolerable earthly peace to exist within which the Gospel can be preached and which the heavenly city makes use of for a time. The earthly city is not an end in itself, but serves an end - communion with God - beyond itself. The role of political authority is to establish the conditions for human flourishing through the promulgation and enforcement of law.

- Beginning with France in 1915, which denaturalized citizens of “enemy origin,” it culminated in the 1935 Nuremberg Laws which divided Germans into those citizens with full rights and those without political rights.68 This legislation resulted in a situation of mass statelessness and formed the background to the “Final Solution.”69 Making this link is not to imply that Western liberal democracies are about to ship refugees off to extermination camps. However, it does draw out how, like the Jews under the Nazi regime, we encounter refugees as those whose human face is locked away in the iron mask of stereotype and stigma and who are without political rights. They are, to use Georgio Agamben’s phrase, reduced to “bare ([Location 3821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=3821))
- Agamben develops the ancient Roman legal category of homo sacer and relates it to both the Jews under the Nazis and contemporary refugees. The homo sacer was someone who, though human, could be killed with impunity or without the charge of homicide but could not be sacrificed to the gods nor submitted to sanctioned forms of execution.70 The homo sacer was naked or bare life, neither simply zoe or natural life nor bios - a participant in a particular form of life.71 Rather, the homo sacer exists in a zone of indistinction, life exposed to death, life that is excluded or banned from participation in both the divine and human community. It is as bare life that refugees raise their most pressing moral claim and unmask the deep contradictions at work in modern political regimes. ([Location 3827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=3827))
- Arendt argues that in the new, secular, emancipated societies of modernity humans were no longer sure of their social and human rights which “until then had been outside the political order and guaranteed not by government and constitution, but by social, spiritual and religious forces.”73 A consensus emerged that human rights needed to be invoked whenever individuals needed protection “against the new sovereignty of the state and the new arbitrariness of society.” ([Location 3836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=3836))
- Agamben points out that the ambiguity between human rights and citizenship is implicit in the 1789 French “Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.” He states: “It is not clear whether the two terms homme and citoyen name two autonomous beings or instead form a unitary system in which the first is always already included in the second.”75 (The same tension can be seen at work in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.)

- The conception of human rights, based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such, broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships - except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human. ([Location 3845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=3845))

- Arendt concludes: “It seems that a man who is nothing but a man has lost the very qualities that make it possible for other people to treat him as a fellow-man.”78 Thus, the very thing that justifies and legitimates a liberal democratic nation-state - the upholding and protection of human rights - proves incapable of upholding and protecting at the greatest point of need. ([Location 3852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005UNVHAO&location=3852))

- Yet the primary need of a refugee is political: it is for an arena of law and order. For Agamben, the separation of humanitarian concern from political action means that humanitarian organizations “maintain a secret solidarity with the very powers they ought to fight.”83 The most pointed example of this was the upholding of the neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross and its refusal to comment on the actions of Nazis, despite knowing about the concentration camps.

- As I have argued, the need of a refugee is for an arena of law and order rather than for food, education, or some other good. The provision of shelter, food, and water (or what might be called immediate pastoral care) to those affected by natural disaster or the ravages of war may be all that is possible, or even appropriate, in particular contexts. Such provision is a means of recognizing another as a human, as one who is the same as me, and thereby communicating that they are not rejected, abandoned, or forgotten but exist in a common world.

- Exclusion is the process by which the proper separation and connections that God establishes are exploded and imploded. Exclusion is destructive of creation because, first, it cuts good connections, breaking down interdependence, so that the other emerges as an enemy; and second, it erases separation, not recognizing the other as someone who, in his or her otherness, belongs to the pattern of interdependence.

- Refugees call us to extend public friendship and question our limits as to whom we recognize as persons; that is, whom we include in the relations of gift-exchange in a particular place and whether our response to the boundaries between ourselves and another is generative or destructive.

- sanctuary was a form of public action that bore witness to how a person’s status as criminal, outlaw, or political subject was relativized and limited by their status as one who is created, fallen, and redeemed by God. The practice of sanctuary was not necessarily a form of dissent or opposition to the crown. Indeed, the sovereign often reinforced and upheld the privilege of sanctuary as the example of chartered sanctuaries indicates. However, sanctuary did limit sovereign power and represented an alternative arena of jurisdiction, and the question of who could or could not claim sanctuary was a site of contestation between church and state. Thus the practice of sanctuary conforms to the O’Donovans’ conception of Christendom as outlined in Chapter 1; that is, it was a measure that embodied the assumption that ecclesial and political authority share a joint responsibility for the formation of an earthly peace and enabling judgment, with the judgment of the church taking the form of proclamation of the Gospel (in this case via the practice of sanctuary) and the judgment of political authority being limited to the arena of coercive human legal and political judgment.
