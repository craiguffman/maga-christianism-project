### Highlights

- The Kantian variant is the most upfront form of this. We have the power as rational agency to make the laws by which we live. This is something so greatly superior to the force of mere nature in us, in the form of desire, that when we contemplate it without distortion, we cannot but feel reverence (Achtung) for this power. The place of fullness is where we manage finally to give this power full reign, and so to live by it. We have a feeling of receptivity, when with our full sense of our own fragility and pathos as desiring beings, we look up to the power of law-giving with admiration and awe. But this doesn't in the end mean that there is any reception from outside; the power is within; and the more we realize this power, the more we become aware that it is within, that morality must be autonomous and not heteronomous. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=158))
- the dualistic, religious dimensions of Kant's thought, his belief in radical freedom of the moral agent, immortality, God-the three postulates of practical reason. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=165))

- There may be a more rigorous naturalism, which accords little room for manoeuvre for human reason, driven on one side by instinct, and on the other hemmed in by the exigencies of survival. There may be no explanation offered of why we have this power. It may consist largely in instrumental uses of reason, there again unlike Kant. But within this kind of naturalism, we often find an admiration for the power of cool, disengaged reason, capable of contemplating the world and human life without illusion, and of acting lucidly for the best in the interest of human flourishing. A certain awe still surrounds reason as a critical power, capable of liberating us from illusion and blind forces of instinct, as well as the phantasies bred of our fear and narrowness and pusillanimity. The nearest thing to fullness lies in this power of reason, and it is entirely ours, developed if it is through our own, often heroic action. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=253))
- This now changes the centre of gravity of the religious life. The power of God doesn't operate through various "sacramentals", or locations of sacred power which we can draw on. These are seen to be something which we can control, and hence blasphemous. In one way, we can say that the sacred/profane distinction breaks down, insofar as it can be placed in person, time, space, gesture. This means that the sacred is suddenly broadened: for the saved, God is sanctifying us everywhere, hence also in ordinary life, our work, in marriage, and so on.But in another way, the channels are radically narrowed, because this sanctification depends entirely now on our inner transformation, our throwing ourselves on God's mercy in faith. Otherwise nothing works, and we create no valid order. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=1299))
- Calvin stresses that God really acts, he communicates grace and sanctification to us. We are fed by God through Christ; and in a sense by his body and blood, because it is his bodily existence which gave satisfaction, culminating in the shedding of his blood. So the Eucharist is the sign of something real, something which has exactly that form, our being fed by God. But what he can't admit is that God could have released something of his saving efficacy out there into the world, at the mercy of human action, because that is the cost of really sanctifying creatures like us which are bodily, social, historical. The whole efficacy of the sacrament is contingent on the connection between God and my faith, a speech act made and uptaken. And we have to see and accept the full meaning for uptake to happen. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=1304))
- So we disenchant the world; we reject the sacramentals; all the elements of "magic" in the old religion. They are not only useless, but blasphemous, because they are arrogating power to us, and hence "plucking" it away "from the glory of God's righteousness". This also means that intercession by saints is of no effect. In face of the world of spirits and powers, this gives us great freedom. Christian liberty for Calvin consists in this: that one see salvation in faith; that one serve God with one's whole heart; and that one no longer be scrupled by indifferent things.85 Wecan cast aside all the myriad rituals and acts of propitiation of the old religion. Serving God now in our ordinary life, guided by the spirit, we can re-order things freely. We don't need to be too impressed by custom; this can lead us terribly astray.86 ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=1309))
- But in view of the importance now given to social order, the generalization of moral demands involved not only placing high moral demands on one's own life, but also putting order into society. This was not seen as involving a watering down of the standards of personal morality, but as completing them. Calvin held that we have to control the vices of the whole society, lest the vicious infect the others. We are all responsible for each other, and for society as a whole.90 ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=1353))
- We can see how from this confidence in our capacity to achieve the three-fold order, a move to an exclusive humanism could be made. What is required is that the reference to God be lopped off, at two points.First the goal of order is redefined as a matter purely of human flourishing. We no longer see the pursuit of it as a way of following God, let alone glorifying him. And secondly, the power to pursue it is no longer something that we receive from God, but is a purely human capacity.But as a consequence of this double movement towards immanence, a new conception of human flourishing is born, which is in some ways without precedent. The new understanding is frequently expressed in terms of "nature", following the philosophical tradition which comes down to us from the ancients.

- And then there is, third, the deliberate attempts by elites, whether old or new, to make over the whole society, to change the lives of the mass of people, and make then conform better to certain models which carried strong conviction among these elites.

- This is only one facet of the new "police state", which undertakes to organize the lives of its citizens in rational ways; ensure that they are properly educated, that they belong to churches, that they lead sober and productive economic lives. It is also an organization which effectively combats various social disasters, as plague is controlled by more rigorous quarantine.

- There are certain common features running through all these attempts at reform and organization: (1) they are activist; they seek effective measures to re-order society; they are highly interventionist; (2) they are uniformizing: they aim to apply a single model or schema to everything and everybody; they attempt to eliminate anomalies, exceptions, marginal populations, and all kinds of non-conformists; (3) they are homogenizing; although they still operate in societies based on differences of rank, their general tendency is to reduce differences, to educate the masses, and to make them conform more and more to the standards governing their betters. This is very clear in the church reformations; but it also is true of the attempts to order people's lives by the "police states"; (4) they are "rationalizing" in Weber's double sense: that is, they not only involve an increased use of instrumental reason, in the very process of activist reform, as well as in designing some of the ends of reform (e.g., in the economic sphere); but they also try to order society by a coherent set of rules (Weber's second dimension of rationality, Wertrationalitat).

- So it is not altogether surprising that this attempt to bring Christ to the world, the lay world, the previously unhallowed world, should inspire a new focus on this world. On one side, this involved a new vision of nature, as we see in the rich Franciscan spirituality of the life of God in the animate and inanimate things which surround us; on another it brought ordinary people into focus.And we might add, ordinary people in their individuality. Because another important facet of Franciscan spirituality was its intense focus on the person of Jesus Christ. This devotion, as Louis Dupre argues, ends up opening "a new perspective on the unique particularity of the person." On the intellectual level, this takes time to work its way out, in the writings of the great Franciscan thinkers, Bonaventure, Duns Scotus, Occam, but it ends up giving a new status to the particular, as something more than a mere instantiation of the universal. Perfect knowledge will mean now grasping the "individual form", the haecceitas, in Scotus' language.12 ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=1531))

- What I'm calling social embeddedness is thus partly an identity thing. From the standpoint of the individual's sense of self, it means the inability to imagine oneselfoutside a certain matrix. But it also can be understood as a social reality; and here it refers to the way we together imagine our social existence, for instance, that our most important actions are those of the whole society, which must be structured in a certain way to carry them out.

- What I'm trying to get at with this term is something much broader and deeper than the intellectual schemes people may entertain when they think about social reality in a disengaged mode. I am thinking rather of the ways in which they imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations which are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images which underlie these expectations. ([Location 2804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=2804))
- I speak of "imaginary" (i) because I'm talking about the way ordinary people "imag-me" their social surroundings, and this is often not expressed in theoretical terms, it is carried in images, stories, legends, etc. But it is also the case that (ii) theory is often the possession of a small minority, whereas what is interesting in the social imaginary is that it is shared by large groups of people, if not the whole society. Which leads to a third difference: (iii) the social imaginary is that common understanding which makes possible common practices, and a widely shared sense of legitimacy. ([Location 2808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=2808))

- Our social imaginary at any given time is complex. It incorporates a sense of the normal expectations that we have of each other; the kind of common understanding which enables us to carry out the collective practices which make up our social life. This incorporates some sense of how we all fit together in carrying out the common practice. This understanding is both factual and "normative"; that is, we have a sense of how things usually go, but this is interwoven with an idea of how they ought to go, of what mis-steps would invalidate the practice. ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=2813))
- What I'm calling the social imaginary extends beyond the immediate background understanding which makes sense of our particular practices. This is not an arbitrary extension of the concept, because just as the practice without the understanding wouldn't make sense for us, and thus wouldn't be possible, so this understanding supposes, if it is to make sense, a wider grasp of our whole predicament,how we stand to each other, how we got to where we are, how we relate to other groups, etc. ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=2823))

- The third, overlapping with the second, is relatively recent. The fractured culture of the nova, which was originally that of elites only, becomes generalized to whole societies. This reaches its culmination in the latter half of the twentieth century. And along with this, and integral to it, there arises in Western societies a generalized culture of "authenticity", or expressive individualism, in which people are encouraged to find their own way, discover their own fulfillment, "do their own thing". The ethic of authenticity originates in the Romantic period, but it has utterly penetrated popular culture only in recent decades, in the time since the Second World War, if not even closer to the present.

- They too seek solutions, or ways of filling the lack, but within immanence; and thus the gamut of new positions multiplies. There is not only the traditional faith, and the modern anthropocentric shift to an immanent order; the felt dissatisfaction at this immanent order motivates not only new forms of religion, but also different readings of immanence. This expanding gamut is what I am trying to gesture at with the term "nova". ([Location 4977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=4977))
- This, along with the Protestant emphasis on the Bible as the ultimate authority, led to a suppression of the older many-levelled Biblical commentary, with its analogies, correspondences and relations of typicality. Hence the idea of fastening on the Bible primarily as a chronicle of events, and trying to extract the maximum of exactitude from the accounts one finds there: a project typical of the post-Galilean age, and which ends up in the ludicrous precision of Archbishop Ussher's calculations.Seen within this framework, the whole of Christian faith stands or falls with the exact historicity of the detailed accounts of the Book of Genesis. There has, e.g., to be a universal flood 1,656 years after Creation, or close thereabouts; or else the Bible is "refuted".What is remarkable about this outlook, in relation to what preceded it, is the elimination of mystery. More exactly, mystery is tolerated in the designs of God; we cannot hope to understand them; but it is banished from His creation. In this way, the new outlook works analogously to, and goes farther than, the Protestant Reformation, which tended to expel the sacred from created things, on the grounds that placing it there is a form of idolatry.

This reaches its culmination in the latter half of the twentieth century. And along with this, and integral to it, there arises in Western societies a generalized culture of “authenticity”, or expressive individualism, in which people are encouraged to find their own way, discover their own fulfillment, “do their own thing”. The ethic of authenticity originates in the Romantic period, but it has utterly penetrated popular culture only in recent decades, in the time since the Second World War, if not even closer to the present.

- I have been exploring how the nova effect arises out of the cross-pressures in the buffered identity. But it is also generated in a whole host of other ways, which emerge when we look at the dynamic of this instability in somewhat finer detail. The whole package: buffered identity, with its disengaged subjectivity, and its supporting disciplines, all sustaining an order of freedom and mutual benefit, has given rise to a gamut of negative reactions, sometimes levelled at the package itself, sometimes against one or other part of it, sometimes against particular solutions which arise from it. I want to look at least at some of these, and follow out a little the path of the polemics. ([Location 6886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=6886))
- let’s set out once more the indictments against orthodox religion. Tersely put, the main points of accusation are: 1. It offends against reason (harbouring a role for mystery, proposing paradoxical notions, such as the God-man). 2. It is authoritarian (that is, it offends both freedom and reason). 3. It poses impossible problems of theodicy. Or it tries to avoid them; being often pusillanimous in proposing to compensate for the most terrible events in history in a future life; or else bowdlerizing in covering up how terrible these events are. 4. It threatens the order of mutual benefit: (i) in mortifying the self: it inveighs against the body, sensual satisfaction, etc., (ii) in mortifying others: in the ordinary case, as well, by its condemnation of the body and sensual satisfaction; but rising to an extreme in actual persecution (Calas case); (iii) in threatening legitimate authority in societies dedicated to furthering the order of mutual benefit.

- They too seek solutions, or ways of filling the lack, but within immanence; and thus the gamut of new positions multiplies. There is not only the traditional faith, and the modern anthropocentric shift to an immanent order; the felt dissatisfaction at this immanent order motivates not only new forms of religion, but also different readings of immanence. This expanding gamut is what I am trying to gesture at with the term “ ([Location 7001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=7001))
- This, along with the Protestant emphasis on the Bible as the ultimate authority, led to a suppression of the older many-levelled Biblical commentary, with its analogies, correspondences and relations of typicality. Hence the idea of fastening on the Bible primarily as a chronicle of events, and trying to extract the maximum of exactitude from the accounts one finds there: a project typical of the post-Galilean age, and which ends up in the ludicrous precision of Archbishop Ussher’s calculations. Seen within this framework, the whole of Christian faith stands or falls with the exact historicity of the detailed accounts of the Book of Genesis. There has, e.g., to be a universal flood 1,656 years after Creation, or close thereabouts; or else the Bible is “refuted”. What is remarkable about this outlook, in relation to what preceded it, is the elimination of mystery. More exactly, mystery is tolerated in the designs of God; we cannot hope to understand them; but it is banished from His creation. In this way, the new outlook works analogously to, and goes farther than, the Protestant Reformation, which tended to expel the sacred from created things, on the grounds that placing it there is a form of idolatry.

- Before examining the embattled link between faith and civilizational order, however, I want to bring out how much the shift I have been talking about consorts with the logic of modern subjectification, and with what we might call the "buffered self". We already saw in the eighteenth century, at one of the important "branching points" mentioned in the preceding Part, that one reaction to the cool, measured religion of the buffered identity was to stress feeling, emotion, a living faith which moves us. This was the case, for instance, with Pietism and Methodism, for whom a powerful emotional response to God's saving action was more important than theological correctness.

- So the dominant religious forms of the Mobilization Age have been destabilized by the current cultural revolution, even as those of the ancien regime were by the onset of the Age of Mobilization.

It is a quest which can't start with a priori exclusions or inescapable starting points, which could pre-empt this experience.This kind of search is often called by its practitioners "spirituality", and is opposed to "religion". This contrast reflects the rejection of "institutional religion", that is, the authority claims made by churches which see it as their mandate to pre-empt the search, or to maintain it within certain definite limits, and above all to dictate a certain code of behaviour.

It is a world in which belief has lost many of the social matrices which made it seem "obvious" and unchallengeable. Not all, of course; there are still milieux in which it is the "default" solution: unless you have powerful intuitions to the contrary, it will seem to you that you ought to go along.

- If we want to carry this account on as a "subtraction story", we might say that secularization, defined as the loss of social matrices of belief, hence decline and fragilization, has at last brought about a "level playing field", because these matrices previously conferred a preferential advantage on belief.

This can go so far as to put in question the practice of infant baptism, or to make of a personal conversion the condition for Church membership (as in colonial Connecticut). But even where it isn't pushed this far, it plays a crucial role. Each Catholic must confess and be absolved so as to fulfill his Easter duties; one can no longer just go along with the group.

Our sense of being comprehensively in secular time is very much reinforced by the very thick environment of measured time which we have wovenaround ourselves in our civilization. Our lives are measured and shaped by accurate clock-readings, without which we couldn't function as we do. This thick environment is both the condition and the consequence of our far-reaching attempt to make the best of time, to use it well, not to waste it. It is the condition and consequence of time becoming for us a resource, which we have to make use of wisely and to advantage.

There is a too quick and too slick explanation right to hand: The denial of transcendence is bound to lead to a crumbling and eventual break-down of all moral standards. First, secular humanism, and then eventually its pieties and values come under challenge. And in the end nihilism.

- It seems we need a stronger ethic, a firmer identification with the common good, more solidarity, if we are really to enter the promised land of a self-sustaining ethical code, or even meet the basic condition of the modern moral order, that our interaction really be of mutual benefit. So can't the response be simply to rewrite the code, put in a bit more Rousseau or Marx?But we are all now painfully aware of the problems involved in this. Too great central control can undercut the prosperity that everyone desires, and can also threaten freedom. The solidarity can't be just managed from on high, but must be something people really identify with. But modern examples of strong common identity, the most prominent of which is nationalism, also pose their own problems, frequently being hostile to diversity, or mobilizing against outsiders. Indeed, they can easily become sites of one or other form of the scapegoat mechanism I discussed in the previous section, that is, the way we shore up our own sense of moral integrity by projecting evil onto some Other, and frequently come to entrench our own conviction of purity and self-righteousness by waging violent persecution or war against this Other.

Even when it seems to be driven by something else, and perhaps partly is, an important role is being played by this debate. This is what I argued above in the case of conversions to unbelief which seem to turn on (and in the mouths of the converts are said to be decided) by a thought of the kind: “science has proven . . .”—e.g., that everything is matter, that God cannot exist.

- If we do adopt the three-cornered picture, however, some interesting questions arise. Explaining each is somewhat of a challenge for the others. In particular, anti-humanism is not easy to explain from the Enlightenment perspective. Why this throwback, on the part of people who are “liberated” from religion and tradition? From the religious perspective, the problem is the opposite. There is a too quick and too slick explanation right to hand: The denial of transcendence is bound to lead to a crumbling and eventual break-down of all moral standards. First, secular humanism, and then eventually its pieties and values come under challenge. And in the end nihilism.

- It seems we need a stronger ethic, a firmer identification with the common good, more solidarity, if we are really to enter the promised land of a self-sustaining ethical code, or even meet the basic condition of the modern moral order, that our interaction really be of mutual benefit. So can’t the response be simply to rewrite the code, put in a bit more Rousseau or Marx? But we are all now painfully aware of the problems involved in this. Too great central control can undercut the prosperity that everyone desires, and can also threaten freedom. The solidarity can’t be just managed from on high, but must be something people really identify with. But modern examples of strong common identity, the most prominent of which is nationalism, also pose their own problems, frequently being hostile to diversity, or mobilizing against outsiders. Indeed, they can easily become sites of one or other form of the scapegoat mechanism I discussed in the previous section, that is, the way we shore up our own sense of moral integrity by projecting evil onto some Other, and frequently come to entrench our own conviction of purity and self-righteousness by waging violent persecution or war against this Other.

- I could have mentioned many other such points of pressure on our fixed positions; but I hope that the basic point has been made more plausible: the present fractured expressivist culture, with its advancing post-Durkheimian understanding, seems very inhospitable to belief. Our world is ideologically fragmented, and the range of positions are growing as the nova effect ([Location 16439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=16439))
- is multiplied by expressive individualism. There are strong incentives to remain within the bounds of the human domain, or at least not to bother exploring beyond it. The level of understanding of some of the great languages of transcendence is declining; in this respect, massive unlearning is taking place. The individual pursuit of happiness as defined by consumer culture still absorbs much of our time and energy, or else the threat of being shut out of this pursuit through poverty, unemployment, incapacity galvanizes all our efforts.

- All this is true, and yet the sense that there is something more presses in. Great numbers of people feel it: in moments of reflection about their life; in moments of relaxation in nature; in moments of bereavement and loss; and quite wildly and unpredictably. Our age is very far from settling in to a comfortable unbelief. Although many individuals do so, and more still seem to on the outside, the unrest continues to surface. Could it ever be otherwise?

- The secular age is schizophrenic, or better, deeply cross-pressured. People seem at a safe distance from religion; and yet they are very moved to know that there are dedicated believers, like Mother Teresa. The unbelieving world, well used to disliking Pius XII, was bowled over by John XXIII. A Pope just had to sound like a Christian, and many immemorial resistances melted. Il fallait y penser. It’s as though many people who don’t want to follow want nevertheless to hear the message of Christ, want it to be proclaimed out there. ([Location 16449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002KFZLK2&location=16449))
- The paradox was evident in the response to the late Pope. Many people were inspired by John Paul’s public peripatetic preaching, about love, about world peace, about international economic justice. They are thrilled that these things are being said. But even many Catholics among his admirers didn’t feel that they must follow all his moral injunctions. And in an expressive, post-Durkheimian world, this is not a contradiction. It makes perfect sense. Such are the strange and complex conditions of belief in our age.
