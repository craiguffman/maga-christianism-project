### Highlights

- Respect for the dignity of the human person was paramount for Maritain. In his view, the dignity of each “single human soul” reaches its full expression in each person’s freedom to enter into a direct relationship with God, who creates the order of naturally sacred things.

- Maritain argues that freedom defined as individual license undermines the dignity of the person, a condition that has been aggravated by recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court which declare that abortion and homosexual conduct are constitutionally protected fundamental rights.

- Maritain understood that it was through a direct and intimate relationship with God that individuals receive what he called the “energies of spiritual and social resurrection” so essential to democracy. He viewed God as the end of the human person and the prime source of political society. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=41))
- conflict between education for social utility and education for freedom. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=52))
- public-school educators have embraced a full-fledged character-education dogma designed to inculcate children in an essentially secular ethic having no transcendent dimension. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=53))
- decentralization of social life in favor of what he referred to as a “personalist and pluralist” regime. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=59))
- frustration over those who were willing to sacrifice truth in pursuit of human fellowship. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=74))
- Maritain cautioned against those leaders who, sacrificing truth for human fellowship, advocated the practice of “kneeling before the world.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00915VHOI&location=76))
