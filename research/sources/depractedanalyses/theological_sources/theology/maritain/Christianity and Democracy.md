### Highlights

- With his redefinition of the human person as an angelic “thinking substance”, replacing the Aristotelian definition of him as a “rational animal”, Rene Descartes inadvertently bequeathed to modern culture the philosophical rationale for discarding faith as a valid source of knowledge.

- But to reject an argument because its origin is religious belief and therefore refuse to consider it on its merits is to commit the genetic fallacy, which is to shift attention from the evidence given to how the evidence came to human attention. ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=66))
- “What we need is not truths that serve us but a truth we may serve” (Degrees of Knowledge). ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=78))
- Maritain sees a different situation, however, with regard to practical philosophy, i.e., ethics and political philosophy. These are not autonomous with respect to their proper object. Because the very aim of ethics is human happiness, it requires for its completion the knowledge of supernatural truths, such as the beatific vision and divine grace, the former being the end of human longing and the latter being the condition for attaining that ([Location 93](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=93))
- Attempts to establish religion without God do not succeed. John Dewey’s A Common Faith is a case in point. If there can be no religion without God, it follows that there can be no Christianity without God; and if there can thus be no Christianity, can there be democracy?

- containing his outline of a new social order or “New Christendom” and his well-known distinction between theocentric humanism and anthropocentric humanism.3 ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=163))

- It is not individualistic but personalist, not collectivist but communitarian, not anarchic but pluralist, not anthropomorphic but theistic. These are the features of his theocentric and integral humanism. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=171))
- the organic and dynamic characters of rights, ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=178))
- According to Jacques Maritain, the true philosophy of the rights of the human person is based upon the idea of natural law. The same natural law lays down our fundamental duties and rights. What is this natural law? It is an order or disposition according to which the human will must act in order to attune itself to the necessary ends of the human being. As for the human person, rights are possessed because of the very fact that it is a person, a whole, master of itself and of its acts, an end which must be treated as such. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=190))
- Thus there are imperceptible transitions (at least from the point of view of historical experience) between natural law, the Law of Nations and positive law. There is a dynamism which impels the unwritten law to flower forth in human law, and to render the latter ever more perfect and just in the very field of its contingent determinations. It is in accordance with this dynamism that the rights of the human person take political and social form in the community.

- democracy is linked to Christianity and not the other way around, ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=250))
- his distinctive thesis that personalist or organic democracy provides a fuller measure of freedom and fulfilment and that it emerges or begins to take shape under the inspiration of the Gospel. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=252))
- What is the reason for the failure of the modern democracies to realize democracy? One reason is the fact that this realization inevitably demanded accomplishment in the social as well as in the political order, and that this demand was not complied with. The irreducible antagonisms inherent in an economy based on the self-propagating power of money, the selfishness of the monied classes, and the secession of the proletariat raised by Marxism to the mystic principle of the Revolution, all prevented the democratic tenets from being incorporated into social life. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=256))
- This form and this ideal of common life, which we call democracy, springs in its essentials from the inspiration of the Gospel and cannot subsist without it; and by virtue of the blind logic of historical conflicts and habits of social memory, which has nothing whatever to do with the logic of thought, we saw for a century the motivating forces in the modern democracies repudiating the Gospel and Christianity in the name of human liberty. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=262))
- Humanist political philosophy is identified by these features: inalienable rights of the person, equality, political rights of the people whose consent is implied by any political regime and whose rulers rule as vicars of the people, absolute primacy of the relations of justice and law at the base of society, and an ideal not of war, prestige or power, but of the amelioration and emancipation of human life—the ideal of fraternity.

- And he is confident that a great renewal of the spirit is taking place which tends to restore democracy to its true essence and purify its principles. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=284))
- Finally under the inspiration of the Gospel at work in history, the secular conscience has understood that in the misfortunes and suffering of our existence, crushed by the iron laws of biological necessity and by the weight of the pride, injustice and wickedness of men, a single principle of liberation, a single principle of hope, a single principle of peace can stir up the mass of servitude and iniquity and triumph over it, because this principle comes down to us from the creative source of the world, stronger than the world: that brotherly love whose law was promulgated by the Gospel to the scandal of the mighty, and which is, as the Christian well knows, God’s own charity diffused into the hearts of men. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=289))
- The true city of human rights recognizes as God only the one true God; it is founded upon the authentic notion of the Common Good; it implies true authority. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=393))
- The true city of human rights has therefore as its principle a conception of the autonomy of the person in conformity with the nature of things and therefore “theocentric”. According to this notion, obedience accepted for justice’s sake is not opposed to freedom. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007AMLAFA&location=394))
