### Highlights

- This study is founded on one definitive choice: God's original choice never to be except to be for us in Christ (Barth 1963, 62). Thus ethics assumes a relationship between humanity and God, a relationship epitomized in Jesus, that constitutes human identity and distinguishes humanity from the rest of creation. To he God's companions: that is the nature and destiny of humankind. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=65))

- It believes God's call turns the world upside-down, but that that subversion finds its power not in numbers or guile but in running with the grain of the universe, that is along the contours of cross and resurrection, remembering God's surprises and anticipating God's transforming future.

- This second aspect of the coming of the kingdom, the fulfillment of potential, is thus not the sentimentalizing of the world or the passing-over of the Church. It is a recognition that the coming of the kingdom is not just about the defeat of sin. It is about the fostering of the imagination, about the opening-out of the Church to receive superabundant gifts of God from every possible source. It is about seeing every person, event, and context in creation as a potential gift that presages a transformed Church and renewed world. The new heaven and the new earth are not a statement about the irremediable character of the old; they are a promise of the transformation of the abundant gifts of God into a flood of grace, a hope of the fulfillment of the kingdom's signs in the kingdom's arrival, a restoration of all that seemed lost in the old by its resurrection in the new.

- The word "congregation" (qrex = crowd + con = together) testifies to the significance of gathering for defining the Church. The people of God mass together like streams trickling into a flowing river. Like the nations going up to the mountain of the Lord's house (Isaiah 2.2-4), people leave aside their daily tasks and come together to form a congregation. For some, the Eucharist begins the moment they enter the doors of the church or meeting-place. Everything that takes place from then until they leave that building has a special significance. For others, it begins as soon as they leave their house. Everything they encounter, from then on, is part of the Eucharist. For others again, it begins the moment they rise in the morning. The ordered liturgy of their daily discipline is shaped by the need to come to the Eucharist with heart, mind, stomach, and strength pert and ready for the wonder to be revealed.

- For others again the Eucharist is not a habit - they begin the day perhaps not knowing if they will join the assembly or not. For them, the Eucharist begins in the moment of invitation, or in whatever constitutes the providential coincidence that leads them to conie to the meeting-place on that day. And then there are those for whom theEucharist has begun long before. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=1907))

Particular days of the year have special importance. On those days, Christians mark and celebrate key events in the story of salvation - notably the birth, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus and the sending of the Holy Spirit. The weeks of the year find their significance in relation to the celebrations of these key events.

- Because the Eucharist is a shared, corporate activity, requiring preparation, it makes the Church find a regular rhythm of celebration. It cannot take place privately, simply whenever is convenient for an individual. And because it is regular, its rhythm comes to order the shapelessness of time.

- By becoming a particular gathering in a particular location the Church locates itself in space, and is made visible. It becomes incarnate, a body gathered to receive the Body. It opens itself to scrutiny, judgment, criticism. Stimulated by such exposure, it seeks to ensure that every aspect of its gathering embodies and communicates its gospel - the unending blessing of God, the catastrophe of sin, the faithfulness of God's vocation to Abraham, his redeeming purpose in Moses, the pouring out of love in Jesus, the… ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=1930))

- But unlike most of that world, it perceives that the definitive way to eat food is as God's companions. And the way to do that is to gather at a stated place and time and to share food together. In other words the central purpose of food is to enable people to meet God in the Eucharist. All other purposes of food - survival, enjoyment, celebration, indulgence - are secondary to this purpose. Food is given to human beings primarily so that they may discover what it means to be God's companions.

- The third gift of gathering is action. Christians gather to do a specific thing together. This specific action, eating together, bestows on the Church its identity, because it gives it a definitive practice. Learning to perform this action well informs and educates Christians in their performance of all other actions. If the Eucharist is the definitive practice of the Church, it isthe first place Christians should look to guide their own practice. To give an example, if a married couple wonder how they will find the grace to stay together, they may be shaped by the practice of Eucharist to discern where the key… ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=1941))

- Being ReconciledThe practice of confessing sin as part of the Eucharist includes four ele- nients, which are not always entirely distinguished in the liturgy: invitation, personal repentance, corporate confession and absolution.invitationFirst, the invitation recognizes that when friends meet again after a breakdown in a relationship, great or small, the appropriate word to begin the conversation is "sorry" ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=2128))

- Sin is not that which makes people unhappy or that which causes pain: it is life that is based on a false story, a story that leads to worshiping something other than the God of Jesus Christ. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=2146))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- So the invitation is a call to the congregation to renarrate their lives according to a true story. Telling the true story of God provides the setting, the necessary context, in which members of the congregation can tell a true story about themselves. And vital to that true story of God is his steadfast love, his constant longing to restore the broken relationship. ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=2147))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- RepentanceAfter the invitation comes a pause for repentance. Though corporate, this is primarily a time for personal reflection. It is not so much an opportunity for cataloging particular sins as a moment to contrast the glory of the true story with the meagerness of the false ones. Repentance means naming and stripping away the tear that distances the disciple from the Gospel. This stripping away is an experience of nakedness.

- Once again it is important that this is a corporate act. If the whole of humanity's estrangement from God were to rest on the shoulders of one individual, the burden really would be intolerable. So intolerable, in fact, that it would make kneeling to confess impossibly daunting, and would make imputing personal blame for global fault absurd. If every Christian's repentance was simply a personal matter, who would address the great scandals of the world, the countless children dying for lack of clean water, the enormous investment in weapons, and the unjust terms of global trade, the depredation of the earth, the pollution of the air, and the denuding of the sea?

- The members of the congregation are recognizing that it is not just their own sin that is separating them from God, it is everybody's. Slavery afflicts not just individuals, but the people of God as a whole. So the members of congregation confess not just their own sins, but the sins of the body.

- For having been confronted with the horror of sin, the way it perverts the truth, the urgency of the need to confess and an opportunity to do so, the members of the congregation then discover that they do not have the power to ruin the story - any more than they have the power to restore it.

- For just as in Baptism the body goes down into the water as if it were buried (Romans 6.4), before being raised out of water as out of the ground, so in absolution the bowed head and bent knee of confession are transformed into the joyful recognition and restored stature of adoption.

- the most important feature of the absolution is its finality. These sins are forgiven. They are expunged. They are not forgotten, but their power to ruin and destroy, their power to affect eternally, is taken away. They do not need to be confessed again. They do not need to overshadow the rest of the service. Indeed they must not. Thus the absolution makes the rest of the service possible. The assembly has gathered; and in greeting it has been transformed into a Church. All that stands between it and God has been taken away.

- Of all the patterns of activity embodied in the Eucharist, one is more important than all the others: praise. The chief end of all human beings, indeed all creation, is to glorify God and enjoy him forever. A significant role of the person presiding, as we have noted, is to unleash the energies of the congregation and to channel then into glorifying God: to foster the gifts that have been given and to cajole them into a harmony of praise.

- By leaving their sins at the door, disposing of them at the outset of the service, they are taught that their shortcomings cannot darn the ever-rolling stream of God's love. Their sins do not determine the shape of the Christian story, but instead are outnarrated, absorbed into a more pulsating narrative. The congregation then stand to glorify the God who has found a place forthem in his story, and they remain standing to experience the feeling of being part of that story. That is what the Psalms and hymns give them. The Psalms explore the height and breadth and length and depth of the life of faith. They are passionate, confident, mystified, wondrous, brutal, proud, grieved, and desperate. But never sentimental. The Psalms paint a world in which no Christian thought is too terrible to name, no Christian feeling too fearful to express.

- The Psalm is both a continuation of the confession and an anticipation of the Scripture readings. For it reiterates what the confession affirms, that fitful human striving is but a parody of God's abiding love. And it looks forward to what the Scripture proclaims, that the overwhelming arms of God nonetheless embrace the clumsy falterings of human discipleship.

- Timing reflects the rhythm of the liturgical year. Advent and Lent, for example, are seasons of penitence and reflection. They have traditionally been times of refraining from ostentatious celebration, in both liturgy and communal practice. Alleluias are omitted from the liturgy. Meanwhile those considering marriage are encouraged to wait until a more celebratory time of year. As Ecclesiastes notes, "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:... a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; . . . a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing" Easter, by contrast, is a 50-day extravaganza of rejoicing. Rejoicing is, for some, as much of a discipline as the hardships of Lent. The timing of the lectionary and calendar are ways in which the Church learns to discern timing in other aspects of its life.

- Christians are always likely to think that the Scripture is something that they read - but in fact the Scripture reads them. It searches them out and knows them, and reads their thoughts from afar. It subverts all the habits of detached scholarship. The careful scholar is the disinterested observer, noting how Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo, or what happens when salt dissolves in water. In this spirit the careful scholar addresses the Scripture reading, and wonders how this strange story can have any bearing on her own story, or on the overarching story of modernity. But the Scripture claims, commands, and questions, and in the process dismantles detachment and invites, even requires, engagement. "I am with you always"; "Wash one another's feet"; "Who do you say that I am?" - these are, on one level, statements, commands, questions. "Know that I am God"; "Love your enemies"; "Can you not stay awake one hour?": these are indicatives, imperatives, interrogatives - but on another level they are headlights, and Christians are rabbits caught in them, and they gradually cease to ask what relevance this story has to them and their time, and begin to wonder, fcartully, if their lives and their generation are exposed as meaningless in the light of the truth of this story.

- When there are regularly three readings, the congregation learn how to hear and read the Gospel: that is, that Christians read the story of Jesus in the context, on the one hand, of the story of Israel, and on the other hand, of the experience of the early Church. The Gospel is always news that emerged from the Jews and was discovered to he the truth by the people who came to he called the Church. To return to the image of the arrow, the story of Israel and the experience of the early Church clarify the point of the Gospel.

- The encounter between the preacher and the congregation should mirror, in its intensity, the encounter between God and his people. God gives his people everything they need. The purpose of the sermon is not to scratch around searching for faint traces of God's ways. It is to recall and portray the overwhelming tidal wave of God's blessing and redeeming purpose, and, lest the congregation drown in the abundance of grace, to focus and funnel the tidal wave down onto a specific moment, now, and to a particular aspect of God's being and action that transforms an identified dimension of contemporary existence.

- If the sermon is to be shaped by the Gospel it must be "good news of great joy for all the people" (Luke 2.10). In other words, to the extent that it is information, it Must be information that is not available elsewhere. In retelling the story of God's action in the past, the preacher redescribes present reality. By portraying how God's activity, hidden or plain, is the key to understanding history, the preacher makes plain that God's activity is the key to understanding the present and the future. It is thus information that shapes the character and understanding of the congregation. The sermon is revelation not education, good news not knowledge, formation not just information, saving truth not just wisdom.

- And the preacher reminds the congregation of the nature of this time, the way it has been characterized by creation, Israel and Jesus, and the habits and practices that equip Christians to live in the time known as Church.

- Earlier we saw how the Eucharist gives Christians space, by requiring them to meet together in a specified place and at a specified time in order to carry out together embodied practices such as sharing food that could not be enacted alone or apart. The Creed gives Christians a comparable sense of verbal space, by setting a series of boundaries within which conceptual practices may take place.

- A rule that has become more evident in the era of liturgical renewal is the recognition that the Creed is the faith of the Church, rather than necessarily the experience or testimony of any one individual. Truth and falsity, faith and doubt, do not lie principally in the conscience of the individual but in the gathered assembly and the Church as a whole. On any one occasion, the faith of one member of the congregation may be strong and vivid, the faith of another faint and fragile. The latter does not miss out parts of the Creed simply because they are felt to be more difficult, but the former recognizes their responsibility to carry the faith of the latter until such time as it shall return clear and lucid. Faith is learned by a people saying the Creed together: there is no integrity to be gained by individual silence in the midst of corporate witness. All this is expressed in the opening word, "We" Whenever ([Location 2666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=2666))

- If God gives his people everything they need to follow him, the practice of intercession is both a recognition of that need and a plea for that need to be met. Intercession balances the honesty and humility of need with the faith and hope of expectation. Expectation is at the heart of hope. If the congregation constitutes a hopeful people, it will be pervaded by a consistent air of expectation. The intercessions represent hope in the way that the Creedrepresents faith and the peace represents love. ([Location 2708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001F0PYP0&location=2708))

- Third, the members of the congregation have heard the proclamation of the Gospel in Scripture and sermon, and in doing so have begun to separate suffering from evil. Just as not all pain is sin, so not all suffering is evil. The plea for God's mercy is a longing that God will intervene to end suffering.But the plea for God's justice is slightly different: it is a longing that God will intervene to overturn evil and oppression.

- Shortly after the intercessions comes the offertory, when bread, wine, and money are placed on the altar. In this context, the intercessions emerge as an act of oblation, an offering of dependence, calling on God to give his people everything they need to follow him. The intercessions are linked to the confession of faith - both acknowledge that all truth, all salvation, and all good things come from God; but they are also linked to the offertory procession, for both witness that the members of the congregation have nothing to offer God but what he has already given them.

- Christians prepare to hear the Word by being reconciled with God. They make their confession and receive absolution before they share the Scripture. Likewise Christians prepare to share food by being reconciled with one another. Just as Scripture and sacrament are two parts of a liturgical whole, two aspects of the one meeting with God, so being reconciled with God and being reconciled with one another are two dimensions of the one movement of forgiveness.

- Like the intercessions, much of the significance of the sharing of the peace may be disclosed by its location in the liturgy. Perhaps most significantly, it comes after the congregation have already confessed their sin and been reconciled with God. In other words those present have been shaped by the virtues of mercy and forbearance, virtues that depend on the knowledge that they too have sinned and been forgiven, that they too have grown through constructive criticism, that they too have moods and quirks and prejudices. They grow in the virtues of humility and honesty, virtues that rest on the realization that the Christian life is not about arriving at perfection, but about making interesting mistakes on the way.

- The members of the congregation seek peace with one another in order to embody the peace they have found with God. They do not have a leg (of their own) to stand on; they do not make peace from a vantage point on the moral high ground; they stand only as sinners forgiven by God, and thereby inspired to extend and experience that grace with one another.
