# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  648

To understand the relationship between character and membership in the Church, it is helpful to look at the way Aquinas explains [q.63 a.1] how the character can be both inner spiritual reality and sign....It is sign through its relationship with the visible sacramental rite in which it is given and whose giving is remembered in the Church (records are kept of baptisms, confirmations, ordinations, and other ecclesial actions that depend on these sacraments).  The rituals of external membership signify the reality of belonging to Christ on the spiritual level of the character, and they also give that belonging its visibility.  The church is thus made, and seen to be made, the sacrament of Christ by the characters. p. 350
