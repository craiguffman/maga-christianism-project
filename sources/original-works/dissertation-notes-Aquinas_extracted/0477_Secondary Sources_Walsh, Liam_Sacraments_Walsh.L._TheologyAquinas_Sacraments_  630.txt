# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  630

Sacraments are human actions, having all the features of human symbolic activity and life choices.   They take the form of signs that have been given by God; and God is acting in them to bring into existence the good that he has promised in the way he has promised it.  Sacraments are acts of God occurring within wholesome and moral human actions.  p. 331
