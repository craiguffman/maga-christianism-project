# Jenkins.J._KFTA_04:  114

When Aquinas claims "intellectus non potest esse falsus" - "the intellect cannot be false," he is using intellect in its original and more specific sense, to refer to the first operation of apprehending the quiddities of things. And, understood in this way, there is one clear and uncontroversial sense in which the claim is true: in the intellect's first operation, an idea is formed, but there is no assertion about whether the form does or does not exist in rebus, in substances in the world. Truth and falsity only enter in the second operation of the intellect, when there is a judgmental compositio or divisio - an affirmative or negative judgment. But, in the first operation, no false judgments are made because no judgments are made; and thus the first operation of the intellect cannot be false (or true, for that matter). 18 So this indefectibility is not due to being always correct or true, but, rather, to stopping short of judgmental compositio or divisio, in which thought and reality are "compared" (a "comparatio", as Aquinas says) and assertion is made.19 Read more at location 1441
