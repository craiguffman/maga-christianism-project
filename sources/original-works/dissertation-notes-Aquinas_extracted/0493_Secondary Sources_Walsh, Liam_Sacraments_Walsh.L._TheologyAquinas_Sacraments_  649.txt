# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  649

The real climax of his discussion comes in the third article, where he explains why the Eucharist is the most important among the sacraments.  He takes his lead from Pseudo-Dionysius in the sed contra with a text that relates the Eucharist to “hierarchical  perfection.”  The sense of ultimacy and perfection pervades the three reasons given for the greatness of the Eucharist.  The first is that in the Eucharist, Christ himself is contained subtantialiter.  This is an interesting anticipation of the key role that substantia will have in Aquinas’ teaching about the Eucharist.  There is more to this reason than an evocation of what will come to be called the real presence.  The Platonic-style contrast between per essential and per participateonem that Aquinas uses is a contrast between full and transient reality.  From the point of view of the one who receives it, the Eucharist gives a bonding with Christ himself, in the full reality of his being, whereas the other sacraments give a transient, functional contact with Christ.  The Christ received in the Eucharist is Christ in the fullness of his priesthood and the fullness of his glory.  He is received as head of the Church.  p. 360
