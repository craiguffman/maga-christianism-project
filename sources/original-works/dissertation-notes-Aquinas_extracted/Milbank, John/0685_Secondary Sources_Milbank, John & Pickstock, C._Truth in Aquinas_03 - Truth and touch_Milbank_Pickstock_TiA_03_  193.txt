too hard a touch not only numbs this sensation, but in numbing the entire body, may also kill it.

Aristotle explains, as we have seen, how to touch mediates proportionately between soul and touchable bodies; he also declares that it is a 'kind of mean between all tangible qualities'.45 But if touching both preserves one's own life and destroys other life (though also gives it, one might add), then we can infer that it is a kind of mean between all living things, and even a kind of mediation between the life and death of the body. We can further suggest that this standing between the life and the death of the body, is the ground, in human beings, for its standing between soul and body, and the allowing of the remove of consciousness. Consciously to understand life has, as its concomitant, the possibility that one can deliberately destroy it—as well as the consciousness that one can be destroyed.Read more at location 2031
