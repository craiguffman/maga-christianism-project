For divine esse is now shown to be such that a new thing can inhere in it, to be such that it can become entirely the suppositum of a creature outside itself, yet without real addition to itself. This last negative safeguarding of divine aseity might seem to deny that divine esse is also divine event, but in fact it achieves the opposite. It denies that divine esse can become event, but affirms that it is event, since an event can entirely come to belong to it without adding anything new. The point must be that God already was, eminently, the new event. Of course, this eminent ground of eventuality in God is none other than the issuing forth of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, which the Incarnation and the instituting of the Church fully disclose once again to fallen humanity. Through this disclosure we come to understand that there can be a created exterior to God, because God's interior is self-exteriorization. We see this because we now have seen that a created exterior can be entirely assumed into the divine esse without abolition, and yet without addition to the Godhead.Read more at location 2269
