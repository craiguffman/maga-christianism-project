# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  639

[What follow pertains to q.62 a.1]  The kind of instrumental prepositions that Paul uses when talking about the role of baptism in justification suggests some real form of causality for the ritual. Similar things are said in Scripture about the Eucharist....  The theological problem is to find a realistic rather than a merely metaphorical explanation of how a humanly-made rite could have a causal role in divine grace.  In [q.62 a.1] a.1 Aquinas...proposes...to think of sacraments as acting, under the primary causality of God, as instrumental causes of grace.  He has used this concept of instrumental causality already to explain how the humanity of Christ could serve his divinity as a real cause of grace....[His approach] has the advantage of not compromising the divine origin of grace (only God is its principal cause), while at the same time giving real value to the human mediation exercised by Christ (raised beyond itself under the movement of God and yet contributing a distinctive human modality to the divine action); it also respects the personal unity of Christ.  It has an analogous value in the theology of sacraments and provides another useful junction between it and Christology.  The human make-up of a sacrament, the putting together of elements and words in an act of human ritual, is taken hold of by the power of God - a power that has already been given decisive human form in the humanity of Christ - and used to cause in those to whom the sacrament is directed the kind of grace that it signifies.  pp. 344-5
