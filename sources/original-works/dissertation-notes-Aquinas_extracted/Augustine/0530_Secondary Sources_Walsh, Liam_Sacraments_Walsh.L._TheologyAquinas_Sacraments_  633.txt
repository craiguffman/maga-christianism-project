# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  633

Aquinas must add a qualification to “sign of the sacred” before it can serve as a statement of what a sacrament is....From here...the specific kind of sign that he will use to understand sacraments is the sign of a sacred reality that is sanctifying humans.  In making this choice Aquinas is working from the assumption that a sign is always a sign of something, and of something other than itself.  He knows that in the language of Augustine, the something signified is called res, and that this something is other than and beyond the familiarity of the sign....the reality signified in signs called sacraments is none other than Christ...the unique and universal principle of sanctification.   pp. 334-5
