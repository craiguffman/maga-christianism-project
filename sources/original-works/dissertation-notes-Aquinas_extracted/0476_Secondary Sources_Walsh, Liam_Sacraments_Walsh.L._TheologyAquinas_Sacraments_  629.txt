# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  629

In crude terms, God never does anything without having an end in view and without generating a form for what is to reach that end.  Where there is divine energy there is, inseparably, divine design and divine desire.  Much has been written in Scholastic theology about sacramental causality.  The concentration has been on efficient causality in a way that often leaves aside the final and formal component’s of God’s action.  When Chauvet criticizes the reliance of a Scholastic theology of sacraments on the concept of causality, he seems to be envisaging causality as efficient, in isolation from final and formal causality.  However, if one is to do justice to Aquinas’ analysis of divine causality, one must recognize his position that when God acts he simultaneously giving finality and form, as well as existence, to what he is doing.  p. 330
