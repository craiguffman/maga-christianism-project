The need for new principles for the assent of faith is not only clear from Aquinas's general discussion of the theological virtues in Summa theologiae i-ii; he also makes the point explicitly in his discussion of faith. In Summa theologiae ii-u.6.i ("Whether faith is infused by God") Aquinas writes: But with respect to . . . the assent of a human person to those things which belong to faith, two causes can be considered. One is that which leads externally: as a miracle which is witnessed, or the persuasion of another human leading [one] to faith. Neither one of these is a sufficient cause, for of those who witness one and the same miracle, or hear the same speech, some believe and some do not. And therefore we must posit a further interior cause, which moves a human being internally to assent to what belongs to faith. . . . For because a human being who assents to what belongs to faith is elevated above his nature, it must be that this occurs in him from a supernatural principle moving internally, which is God. And therefore faith, as regards the assent of faith (which is the principle act [of the theological virtue] of faith), is due to God moving internally through grace.20 In this passage Aquinas says that certain credibility arguments have a role in moving one to assent, though what this role is is not entirely clear from this passage. What is clear is that such arguments are not sufficient to move the UNO-natural intellect to assent; grace is required. Yet according to the NI the credibility arguments are sufficient.
