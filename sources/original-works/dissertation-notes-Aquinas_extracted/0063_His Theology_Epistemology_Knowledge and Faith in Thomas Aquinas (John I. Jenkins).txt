Knowledge and Faith in Thomas Aquinas (John I. Jenkins) - Highlight Loc. 228-30 | Added on Monday, September 28, 2009, 02:56 PM  Most importantly, I  will argue that a key condition of scientia for Aquinas is that the  principles of a demonstration be better known than the conclusion,  and that this has important consequences which have been overlooked  by commentators. For I will argue in subsequent chapters that this is  the understanding of scientific knowledge which Aquinas brings to his  treatment of Christian theology (which he calls "sacred doctrine"),  and that it determines the purpose and structure of his Summa theologiae  in ways which have not been appreciated.
