# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  632

Aquinas...decides that the best way to get at the truth about sacraments is to think about them as one thinks about signs.  He is locating sacraments, then, in an area of human experience that has its own logic and its own language.  Whatever he says subsequently about sacraments has to be understood as the kind of thing one says about signs.  They are signs of the sacred.  p. 334
