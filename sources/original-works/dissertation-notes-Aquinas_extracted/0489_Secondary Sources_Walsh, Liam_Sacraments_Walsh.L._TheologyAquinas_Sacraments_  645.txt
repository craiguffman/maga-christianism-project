# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  645

[Aquinas] adds that while sin is taken away by the gift of grace, qualification for worship is provided by the giving of character.  Aquinas argues that those who are empowered to do something are normally marked out for their task: Christians are marked out for divine worship, and this marking is called character.  The downward movement of sanctification thus has two component gifts: holiness of life and consecration for holy actions.  The upward movement of the sacrament is the grace-filled worship of persons so sanctified, exercising their role as consecrated people in virtue of their character, and having holiness of life to offer to God in virtue of grace.   p. 349
