# Sermon 20220911-Up to 4K

[00:00:00] One of the delights of being a preacher that any experienced preacher knows is when someone comes up to you and says, uh, wow, how did you know? And the secret for every preacher is, I didn't know. And any preacher will tell you it was the spirit. It was the spirit just coming, bringing a word that just happened to be the word you needed to hear.

Today's one of those days where I say to the spirit, How did you know? So today there will be a little bit of me preaching to myself. I hope you'll walk with me as I, as I contemplate something that began, uh, as, as I was talking to my youngest son, Sudhir, whom you guys know, um, about one of his Cub Scout requirements.

He is on what's called the, what's it called? The, uh, PAC on, no, I, The Paw on the [00:01:00] Trail, uh, which is, which is an adventure in which he learns how to live out in the out, great, great outdoors. It's where he learns to hike. And, and so his, he was very excited about all of the adventures that we had planned and we were working towards.

But it came to the time when I was to talk to him, like, about requirement number four, I think it was, which was a conversation about what to do if you get lost. Now, you could imagine the panic in his eyes. That ensued at that thought and his first response was, But both pair! You'll stay with me, won't you?

And of course, then I got about the process after reassuring him of just saying, But just in case, these are the things you need to know. And I taught him the stop process, S T O P. Stay, think, observe, plan. Stay calm and stay put. Think about how you can cooperate with those who you know will be seeking you.[00:02:00] 

Observe, listen for people who are looking for you and blow your whistle three times. Regularly. And then plan, figure out how to stay dry, figure out how to get some water if you can. But most of all, don't worry. You will be found.

Why talk about being lost in the wilderness? with a little boy or a little girl. Why talk about being lost this morning? Why is this a recurrent theme in our lectionary? I want to suggest to you that it's because the journey that we call walking the way of love, following Jesus in other words, consists of Exploring faraway mountains, and it consists of traveling through deep, dark jungles, and it consists, unfortunately, of having to cross some very barren, very dry deserts.

And if you commit to this [00:03:00] adventure, and even if you don't, what you can count on is there will be some time in your life where you will experience the panic I saw in my, my youngest son's eyes. The panic that comes when you realize That you've become separated, separated from the guide who was your security, and separated from all your fellow travelers.

Have you ever been lost? Have you ever been lost? Can you remember, if so, how that felt? When I talked to Sudhir, that look of panic that flashed in his eyes was, was stunning to me because I had forgotten that feeling. He imagined himself all alone, instantly, with no one to help him and having to fend himself against all coming threats [00:04:00] in a very unfamiliar territory.

Being lost, I want to suggest, is not a matter of an absence of information. It's not the, it's the only issue is that we're lacking information about we, where we are. You can't cure being lost by merely giving somebody GPS coordinates or a map, as though the only thing that's lacking is a knowledge of where they are.

Now, it can be that way the older you get. You know, for example, I am so experienced in backpacking that even in those moments when I have no idea where I am, I don't feel lost because I feel equipped. No, being lost is a relational thing. It's about being separated from your guide and your fellow travelers and feeling unable to return to them on your own.

It's about the anxiety that overwhelms us when we sense that we don't know how to [00:05:00] survive the wilderness that we're wandering. Being lost is a relational thing. And that's why it's possible, at least it's possible for me, to be in a crowded room filled with people that I know and still feel lost. Have you ever been that way?

I remember writing about that when I was a teenager. Have you ever felt lost? Even when surrounded by familiar faces. Being lost is a relational thing. So let's unpack that further, thinking about our lessons today. Being lost is a matter of forgetting who you are. Which is the first derivative of forgetting whose you are.

And thereby forgetting how he is. God, the Father, taught us to navigate the wildernesses of our lives. [00:06:00] That's why you, here at St. Stephen's, regularly hear me say that salvation consists of God's gift of memory. There's a refrain that occurs in the scripture, and I've been so curious about how often it occurs this week as I've thought about this.

Uh, that I, I did a bit of counting. I lost count, but I know that at least 90 times in Scripture we hear this refrain. It's in Exodus. It's in Leviticus. I was counting the Scriptures that occurs in all these Scriptures. One of the things that I, I, I did is I counted how many times it occurs in Leviticus.

And, uh, and, and so what I discovered is that in Leviticus, it's embedded in the phrasing of each of God's instructions on how we are to flourish. And it goes something like this, this refrain that's over 90 times in the, in the Hebrew scriptures. For I am the Lord who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God, thus you shall be [00:07:00] holy for I am holy.

There's that formula I was giving you. Remember who you are. By remembering whose you are and then remembering all I taught you about how to flourish. That's the refrain that we hear introducing all of God's instructions. And Thomas Aquinas famously described the thing that we're about to do in a while, the Lord's Supper, as the medicine of salvation.

And if you think about it, what is that we do as we take that medicine from the Lord? We Remember the mighty works of God so that we receive the gift of identity. Every single week we do this. Jesus says do this in remembrance of me and that's Jesus's way of rescuing us each week by reminding us whose we are and how he [00:08:00] taught us to flourish and continues to teach us to flourish.

Now, lest you're skeptical of my claim that being lost is a relational thing, consider the joy that we feel when we've been found, when we're reunited from those from whom we've been separated, when our sense of isolation suddenly evaporates. We discover the delight of once again being one with our loved ones.

I'm reminded of my wife, Sejina, and how she felt lost as she went through, and even after her divorce. You see, divorce for her was deliverance from despair, as it is for so many. But divorce remains taboo for much of American culture. Her Indian cultural norm expects a woman to sacrifice herself. [00:09:00] And choose that sacrifice of self over divorce, in part so that she does not bring shame upon her family, particularly her extended family.

So as she was going through it, Sejina felt lost and isolated from her family, whom she anticipated would see her as fallen, as a source of shame for them. Now sadly, there will always be folks. who see us as fallen when we don't comply with cultural norms. She had a beloved uncle and a beloved aunt whom she had not seen in many years.

And they came to the United States for a wedding, a family wedding, and, and, and she had some trepidation about this. She anticipated a shunning. She anticipated a harsh rebuke. And so she imagined what it would be like to to meet this beloved uncle. who was like a [00:10:00] patriarch figure for her. And so she approached him with trepidation, but much to her surprise, his eyes when she came into his presence sparkled and he prayed a blessing on her new life and she, and he assured her as always that he treasured her and that she remained treasured throughout most of the family.

There was no shame. There was no separation. And what I remember is her relief, her joy. What she, when she thought she was lost, she discovered she was found. Being lost is a relational thing. And because it's, being lost is part of our shared human experience, I think that we can Be strengthened by listening very carefully to our parable this morning Jesus talks [00:11:00] about the lost sheep and the Good Shepherd But before we dig into that, let's briefly think about Who can be lost and How is it that we get lost in the first place?

and I suggest we pause to think about those things because I had a dialogue with Some of my Annapolis classmates regarding how Christian nationalism is infecting our national discourse in an unhelpful way. And in the course of that conversation, he made, one of them made, a distinction between being lost and being saved.

He said to me, I can't be lost because I'm saved. Saved is, was his way, in his tradition, of saying that he is baptized. He believes, and those in this dialogue believe, that they can't be lost because they've already been forsaved. So for them, as they listen to [00:12:00] this story today, the lost denotes someone else, other people, not them.

Lost means not being Christian to them. But I think if we think about being lost as a relational thing, we can see why that's actually confusion on their part. Lost is neither your identity nor your destiny. It's a relationship status at one particular point in your life. And we Christians are just as vulnerable to being lost as anyone else.

And I've mentioned my friend, uh, Professor Doug Campbell from Duke many times to you. And one of the most important things that Doug has taught me is that the only difference between Christians and other people is that we Christians are about the project and we've committed to being about the project of being rehabilitated from our addiction to sin in a particular way, by hanging [00:13:00] out with Jesus, the Messiah.

That's the only difference between us. We are just as likely to get lost as anyone else. Being baptized does not mean that we are saved from being lost. It means we promise to practice the art of being found.

So how do we get lost?

You know, today in our confessional prayer, we talked about grace is new every morning from the, from the poem Limitations. And that's one of the things that we profess that, that, that God is about the process of making all things new. Now, if you're a scientist, you might say it in a different way. Entropy, the tendency of the universe towards disorder.

Have you ever thought about the fact, if you know any science, and I got Tom here, my physics teacher who's going to keep me honest here, but that the very [00:14:00] engine of creativity in the universe is this tendency toward, towards disorder that we call entropy. There's all, things are always changing on us. The terrain on which we walk, the, the places we climb are constantly being, being transformed.

And as a, as a real simple example of that, I, I looked upon, I picked up this and brought it for you. This is about two inches by one and a half inches. And I was looking at this and remembering a conversation I had with actually with Bill Gates from a distance. He was a room smaller than this and I was at a conference for my company and he was talking about.

What he thought would happen in technology. And we had, my company had, uh, these, these, these, uh, servers on which our software ran. They were about this tall. And the reason they were so tall, mostly, was because they had hard drives that were huge. And, and we had one that was monstrous. It could store 300 megabytes of information.

300 [00:15:00] million bytes of information. This thing was this tall. Above my knees. And he said something remarkable. He said that, before the year 2000, we'll see hard drives that could hold 1 billion bytes. On this little device here, this is holding 6 trillion bytes of information. Our world is constantly changing.

So I just want to suggest that the very engine of God's creativity, uh, is one of the causes, one of the causes of our constantly being lost. And we should be, just recognize that that's part of it. Another reason is things that happened to us. Today's the anniversary of 9 11. We remember that tragedy happens to us, and at such times, you can remember now, and I ask you to touch base now, how you felt at the shock of seeing those planes crash through those towers, and at the Pentagon, and all the other things that happened so quickly, and how it changed our [00:16:00] lives so remarkably, and how we felt lost as a country, and lost individually.

And the same thing happens when you lose a loved one, as several of us know.

Another reason, though, is that we live in a world that teaches us that our freedom to pursue our personal desires is the highest priority. And as a result of that, it's no wonder that we wander from broken relationship to broken relationship. Yeah. No wonder we so often feel lonely and isolated when our personal desires are the most important thing.

And as we wonder, it's easy for us to wonder, who we are, whose we are, and how in the world we are going to flourish in the terrain that we've just encountered. There's [00:17:00] an old Methodist preacher named George Buttrick who asked a farmer Why do sheep get lost? You see, the farmer had just come back from rescuing a sheep who'd been lost all day long.

And the farmer said, they just nibble themselves lost. They go, he explained, from one tuft of grass to another until at last they've lost their way. We're not much different from sheep, I think, in that way. And so I think the true description of our journey along the way of love, we should expect to be something like this cadence.

We are lost and found, lost and found, lost and found. Not just because we are blind sinners, but also because we take our [00:18:00] eyes off our trail guide. Jesus. We, and we trust in orthodoxies like the, the one I mentioned regarding divorce, and that sketch the terrain of an earlier era. And we forget that when you live with a God who's making all things new, the terrain is always changing, and so we lose our way.

So with that, let's talk about the art of being found. It's Undoubtedly good news for us to remember that Jesus is the Good Shepherd. And we are under his care and his protection. But it's not the only good news that I think we see in this parable that Jesus shares with us of the, of the lost sheep in the Good Shepherd.

Now to get at that, I need to tell you a story. I, I, uh, was sitting at my house once, and the next door neighbor came over, and she, uh, needed some help, and she was [00:19:00] frantic. And, and so I went over, and what had happened was a deer had gotten into her swimming pool. And so I said, ooh, this is difficult. Uh, so I got into the water, you know, got, got hold of the deer and somehow, I don't even remember how, somehow managed to pick the deer up, get it out of the water.

But the point I wanted to make is what the deer did. The deer obviously recognized that he and I, or she and I, I should say, had no relationship. She didn't turn around and say, thank you very much for saving my life. What she left me was a bunch of ticks that were all over her, and she bolted out of there as fast as she could.

And while I was in the water, she kicked me, so my, I was bleeding from her hooves, kicking me. She resisted like hellfire. And I wanted to put that portrait in your mind, as you think about this, this, this story that Jesus tells us, I want you to notice the verb that Jesus uses when he [00:20:00] compares The sheep and us in verse 7.

The sheep returns home and the sinner repents. The verb that Jesus uses there, and we translate it into Greek, metanoia, is the word to repent. And that verb, I think, brings up a very important insight concerning the agency of us lost sheep. The sheep, in other words, is not passive in her rescue. The shepherd comes.

But, the lamb takes an active role. It constantly bleats. Constantly bleats, so the shepherd can hear it and find it. The shepherd calls for the sheep. And when it lasts, the sheep hears. The sheep emits a distressed signal. All of a sudden, the frequency, the cadence changes. It begins bleating very fast and repeatedly.

And those bleats mean, Rescue me! Rescue me! I want to go home! And here's my point. [00:21:00] Jesus teaches us, I think, something remarkable about repentance with this parable. You see, repentance is a dance of reconciliation. There are two dancers, both have steps in the dance. We usually focus on the Good Shepherd's actions, which involve venturing out and finding the lost sheep.

But the Dance of Repentance also includes the movement of the sheep in being found, the art of being found. As scholar Kenneth Bailey put it, who studied what happens when sheep are lost. The sheep knows it's lost, listens for the shepherd, responds to the shepherd's approach with its frantic bleeding, and accepts the rescue rather than running away as that sweet little old doe ran away from me.

You see, a sheep doesn't struggle against the rescuer. A sheep remembers whose she is and is overjoyed. And [00:22:00] what Jesus says by his analogy, if you pay close attention to the text, is that that joyful acceptance of our unmerited welcome home is our part in the dance. It's our active part in our own reconciliation whenever we are lost.

But there's more. But to notice that we actually have to pay attention to why Jesus told these three parables in the in the Luke 15th chapter in the first place. You see he was responding to the grumbling just like the the Israelites grumbled in the wilderness, the Pharisees and the legal experts were grumbling about Jesus hanging out with all the wrong people.

Now that phrase is Luke's standard way of of denoting the Uh, multiple groups of elites who opposed Jesus's priorities. They grumbled because he was hanging out with tax collectors and sinners, the wrong people. And that was problematic because that meant that he [00:23:00] was sharing meals with, and, uh, with them, and that meant he was having a spiritual union with them, and that meant that he was unclean.

He was uniting with unclean people and becoming unclean himself, which is not what a good rabbi should do. Who were the wrong people? Well, they were the outcasts. The lowest stratum of society, the people called the people of the land. And according to Pharisaic orthopraxy, they were unclean by their work, by the work that they did, and by their failure to practice ritual purity.

So Jesus answers these elites complaint. Him by telling these three parables. That's why he's telling this story in the first place. And the first thing is he preci supposes an off stage responsibility of a bad shepherd. If Jesus is the good shepherd, there's a bad shepherd too who failed to tend the flock.

And Jesus' point is that hosting meals is all about [00:24:00] rescuing the father's lost sheep as foretold in the Hebrew scriptures. And he concludes with this statement. The Father has more joy over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who need no repentance. And lest we miss how Jesus, in saying that, is mocking the Pharisees with his reference to 99 who need no repentance, Jesus concludes his third parable with a story that we talked about last week, or the week before, of the prodigal elder brother, who felt he had no cause for repentance.

His little brother did, and he refused to celebrate with his father when his younger brother returned home. So even though they're obedient, Jesus is saying, the Pharisees are confused in thinking that they need no repentance. Here's the key. If you can't celebrate with your father when your brother comes home, well then your relationships are disordered.[00:25:00] 

They're not rightly ordered. Being lost, you see, is a relational thing. If your relationships are not rightly ordered, you are lost. So like the 99 sheep, the grumbling Pharisees remained in the wilderness. And the only way they can be found is if they reconcile with those from whom they are estranged. And if they share, like the elder brother, in the joyful celebration of the good shepherd.

Whenever any sheep is found. Being lost is a relational thing. So what's your status on your journey right now? This is the question I ask myself. Is there someone God called you to bless from whom you've wandered? Is there someone God has given to you as a blessing from whom you [00:26:00] are estranged? Are you lost?

Do you need to practice the art of being found by aligning yourself with God's heart and thereby discovering yourself at home? Now, when we speak of God's heart in seeking us, there's one other dimension to this story that's only implicit here, but is heavily evoked in that third parable of the prodigal sons.

And that's the amazing grace that seeks us even when we flee our home. The father whose child has done the equivalent of wishing him dead is ever vigilant, unchanged in his fatherly love. Searching longingly on the horizon for any sign of the child's return home. I want you to imagine that's the Good Shepherd who's seeking you now.

Think about that. Jesus is our Good Shepherd. [00:27:00] He's the light that conquers the darkness. He's the one who's looking for you. He's constantly calling out for you, who's searching the valleys, the forest hills, the deserts, who's ignoring the wolves prowling, feeling his way with his shepherd's stave, sometimes falling, sometimes getting caught up in the brambles that you walk through and tearing his clothes, but never ever ceasing to seek you until he finds you.

And when he finds you. He knows you're temporary, temporarily helpless, so he lifts you up, puts you on his shoulders, and carries you home. No matter how far off you wander from the trail, no matter how far you feel you have descended, the shepherd will seek to rescue you. This is foundational. And when he finds you, there is no condemnation, [00:28:00] only joy in the heart of God.

So if you're lost, know that God has already launched a search and rescue operation for you and he won't give up until you're found. And so I challenge you this way, do you know someone who's lost? If so, remember who you are and who's she is and jump on that chopper and join the search and rescue party.

When you share the joy that another is found, that fills God's heart with joy. And that also will make your joy complete as well. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
