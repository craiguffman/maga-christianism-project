# Sermon 20220904-Up to 4K v2

[00:00:00] Tough words this morning in scripture. Uh, James, Jim, when he was reading our prayer of illumination had to pray that we would be able to bear the hearing of the word today. And if you were listening closely to the gospel that Jeannie just read to us, you, uh, you know that the, the worldwide church who preaches from the revised common lectionary is struggling this morning because we received from the Lord a problematic word.

A problematic word recalled in Luke's gospel, whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple. Well that text is how I planned to [00:01:00] kick off a new series for September that we are beginning today. called Having Words with Jesus.

The, the, the lectionary's gonna present us with some really tough things to hear from Jesus in the next few weeks. And so we're, we're gonna chew on some words from Jesus that we find hard to hear, hard to bear. And the challenge that I planned was to ask us to count the cost of naming ourselves as Jesus's followers.

For us to consider the radical transformation, the radical differences, the The, that we are called to make in the world that has different priorities. And the question I planned to present is this. Are we ready? Are we willing to make the sacrifices that Jesus calls us to the make, to make for the world that he loves so much?

Now, I think that's still an [00:02:00] essential question for us this morning, but I fear we might hear it in our American Christian silos that make it merely about me and my salvation, you and your salvation, which I think this morning would be to miss Jesus's point. You see, we'd miss wrestling with what it means for us to be one people, to, to act as a single body in the world.

To be his living body, loving, and through him, transforming the world through his love as channeled through us. The cost of discipleship, Jesus said, shouldn't be underestimated. It's tough stuff, this way of love.

Are we ready to pay that price? Are we prepared to break the bonds so long cultivated with our father, with our mother, with our [00:03:00] wife, with our children, with our brothers and sisters, and, and with all the lives, uh, that we've come to love? Are we, are we prepared to, to break the bonds with the lives that we've constructed so reconfigure those relationships so that we channel His love?

Amen. Amen. His love for them rather than our own pale imitation of love. A love that serves as our excuse, actually, for not following him when our culture seduces us with idols. Do we have the courage, in other words, to say no, like we talked about last week? No to our culture's zero sum view of the world that responds to every effort, every conversation about justice by dividing us into binary groupings of winners and losers, good and evil, them and us.[00:04:00] 

Well, that's what I planned to talk to you about this morning. Then I got a text from my brother, Keith, in Houston. He's a pastor there. And he said, Craig, you have to listen to this sermon. It's just what you've been warning about, Christian nationalism straight from the pulpit of one of the largest churches in America, the Second Baptist Church of Houston, which has a little bit larger congregation than ours with 80, 000 members.

I listened to it and it was, I tell you, charismatic. It was inspiring. It was, um, Very eloquent. It was appalling. In the name of Jesus, you see, he proclaimed a cynical exegesis. He used, in other words, the book of Revelation to John to inspire Christians, all the ones that were listening to him, which isn't just those 80, 000 members, but broadcast throughout the world, [00:05:00] to, to jihad.

Inspire him to holy war against the enemy that he said is destroying America. By allowing lawlessness, sexual immorality, and ways of being that he found objectionable. And he called his congregation to use everything in their power to destroy that enemy. And to take back America. But here's the thing that really got me.

The enemy that he described is us. He characterized it as a war, you see, against wokeness. Now, I hope everybody who's hearing me this morning stays awake. That would be a first. But I doubt any of us here would actually describe ourselves as woke. In fact, I bet most of you, like me, have never actually used that word before, except in its [00:06:00] ordinary sense, in the biblical sense of, like Paul says and Jesus says, sleepers, awake.

But evidently, wokeness has evolved in its meaning. Its detractors no longer use it as a word that merely complains about excessive political correctness or excessive microaggressions, a new word in our vocabulary, an important word for us to learn in our vocabulary. Wokeness, evidently, is a word that denotes all who are responsible for a long list of cultural changes that have happened in our lives, in particularly the last two generations, or two decades, I'm sorry.

And when that pastor, and when lots of others like him, name wokeness as God's enemy, the people that they denote, the people against whom he urges war in the name of Jesus, are those who challenge. The primacy of Anglo Protestant cultural [00:07:00] norms and power distribution, in particular, that which was in place when you and I were born.

In their eyes, we are woke. Who knew?

These days we regularly hear politicians using this kind of belligerent rhetoric. Politicians. But it's easy for us to dismiss politicians and their empty words. As being simply partisan, part of the game. And we've seen the signs with the cross superimposed on the American flag, you know, particularly, you know, carried by those who assaulted the Capitol, but also lots of marches.

But it's easiest to dismiss that event and those, those marches as, as, as one off explosions of tensions that were spawned by a very divisive election. It's easy for some of us, at least, to do that. But brothers and sisters, this is a big [00:08:00] deal. We must take seriously the hatred directed at us by our fellow American Christians while they are at worship this morning.

Think about that. We must take seriously that pastors at the wealthiest and most prominent churches in our country are advocating from the pulpit a distorted, non Christocentric gospel that justifies violence and justifies hatred against those that they view as enemies. We must take seriously that in our country, passive, uh, pastors with massive congregations Now, if you are a student of history, you'll recognize this pattern.

The language has changed, but not the basic plot. You see, our nation [00:09:00] fought a long, hard battle under Lincoln's leadership to insist that America will continue to be a nation Figuring out how to embody the principle that all of us are created equal. And Lincoln died because he dared to fight for that principle.

And once he died, the resistance to that idea arose. Like weeds overtaking a garden. We passed the Civil War amendments to the Constitution, and then we spent the next two decades creating laws that subverted them. In a similar language to what we're hearing today, those whose dominant power was threatened, you remember, they rose up, they rioted, they lynched, they intimidated, and they passed laws to restore the dominant power that Lincoln taught us we must relinquish if we are to become our country, if we are to achieve [00:10:00] our country.

It was the same rhetoric that we hear today. Just different suits. So, as you know, Jim Crow was born. Yet we didn't give up on that experiment, our American experiment. We fought for decades to overcome the sacrilege that was Jim Crow. Due to the sacrifice of many, the struggle reached an apogee in the 1950s and 60s when Those of us here, many of us here were coming of age, you remember it.

And so you remember, we fought over water fountains, we fought over schools, we fought over the right to vote, we fought over the right to work and to live and to pursue life, liberty, and happiness as a people who understand themselves to be created equal. And once again, there was a victory. This time in the form of civil rights legislation of the early 1960s.

But, [00:11:00] once again, resistance to those laws arose, like weeds overtaking a neglected garden. And we spent the 1970s and the 1980s defending against laws intended to dilute or subvert those gains. And once again, using the language of law and order. Those whose dominant power was threatened rose up and they passed laws to protect the dominant power that Lincoln taught us we must relinquish if we are to achieve our country.

Same rhetoric, different suits. Yet we persevered and we continued the struggle to achieve our country as Lincoln taught us. And once again in 2008 there was a victory. We did what seemed an [00:12:00] impossibility when we were born. We dared to hope that we could finally live as one people dedicated to the proposition that all persons are created equal.

And we elected the son of a white man and a, excuse me, a white woman and a black man as our president. But once again, resistance to those hopes arose. Like weeds overtaking a neglected garden. And once again, using the language of law and order, those who cling to dominant power reveal now that they have given up on democracy.

They assault our institutions, and once again, they threaten us with civil war. And they do all they can to intimidate those of us who stand in their way. In their way of their lust for the dominant power that Lincoln taught us that we must relinquish if we [00:13:00] are to achieve our country. Same old rhetoric, just different suits.

Now we've seen this plot before. It's as old as Caesar. Dominant power, though a minority, clings to power by turning all ways to apocalyptic rhetoric. And it's no accident that the Houston preacher didn't actually preach about Jesus and his way of love, but rather cherry picked apocalyptic texts from the Revelation to John, the ones that, not the ones we preach from during funerals and such that speak about Jesus way of love, but rather Some that describe the world in binary terms.

You know those binary terms. It's a false view of the world. It's though the world actually is rightfully divided into good and evil. Them and us.[00:14:00] 

In the strongman's blasphemous rhetoric, those who cling to dominant power are always, always dressed up as saviors. They are the righteous defenders of the Constitution that they subvert. They paint themselves as victims. Through apocalyptic rhetoric, they sow chaos and inspire violence from those they seduce.

Then they use the disorder that they just sowed to justify their return to power with cynical rhetoric, always about law and order. And slowly, we voluntarily empower tyrants, enabling them to disassemble our democracy plank by plank. What I'm describing to you is the tyrants playbook, and in the last few decades we have seen that playbook executed in Serbia, [00:15:00] Croatia, Hungary, Hungary, uh, Myanmar, India, Syria.

Russia, and some say that's what we're seeing here today. It's the template for how minorities seize and hold on to dominant power. Brothers and sisters, at such times, it's easy, particularly when you have been labeled an enemy, to return hatred with hatred, to take the bait, and to respond to violence.

with violence, to be a part of this cycle, part of this playbook, to do what's expected by the playbook. But the hostility to which Jesus calls us in our biblical text this morning in the gospel is a renunciation not of our fellow citizens. It's a renunciation not of our loved ones. It's a renunciation of the secular ways of loving our secular notions of justice, [00:16:00] our secular notions of power.

Following Jesus requires renouncing our secular ways and adopting His. So rather than struggling to love your mother and father as they should be loved, to love your spouse and children with our pale imitation of love. To love our siblings in our own way. This morning, Jesus calls us to get out of the way.

To get out of His way. Not our love, but His. Not our justice, but His. Not our power, but His. And that means that we don't look upon our family And our friends with our eyes, but his, we don't look upon those who see us as enemies this morning with our eyes, but [00:17:00] his Jesus calls us as Luther noted to make ourselves small so that he is big.

To get out of His way, to renounce our own preferences, our own instincts for dominant power, so that we might become what He called us to be. Channels of His infinite love for all, as we pray in the Eucharist this morning. Allowing His love, His justice, His power to flow through us. Get out of the way, just let Jesus love flow.

It can handle all. It is intended to bless all. And that's costly discipleship. But that's the deal. That's what Jesus in the gospel is saying to us this morning. Know what the costs are when you say you will follow me. Follow me with eyes who know what you're getting into. Costly discipleship. That's what it means to follow [00:18:00] Jesus.

Whether we're at home or in our local or national discourse. Brothers, sisters, thousand dollar suits and silk ties can't camouflage a plantation preacher. You can recognize them every time, for they don't preach the good news of costly discipleship. They don't preach the good news of a Messiah who liberates us from our secular ways, you know, so that we can take up His ways.

They don't press us to figure out how to embody this really tough proposition that God sees us all as God's beloved, that we are actually created by God as equal. Instead, in the name of God, they justify the dominant power. The dominant power that pays for their pulpit and purchases their souls. Like [00:19:00] their antebellum archetype.

21st century plantation preachers don't preach the gospel of Jesus either. They preach the myth of a lost cause, that America was once great and would be great again if only good Anglo Protestants take to the streets to take back that which was stolen from them and to turn America at last into the Christian nation that God intended us to be.

That's the story they preach. Plantation preachers do the tyrant's bidding. They always have. And that's why Jesus said in the same gospel from which we get our reading today, the gospel of Matthew, Watch out for false prophets. They come to you dressed like sheep, but inside they are vicious wolves. You will know them by their fruit.

We must resist. [00:20:00] We must resist. In our gospel today, Jesus says clearly, you know that their leaders lord it over them and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you. That's the contrast. That's the contrast that Jesus taught the first disciples and that's the contrast Jesus teaches us this morning about power.

It will not be so among you. Don't lust for dominant power, embody servant power. That's how you follow me. That's how I am reconciling the world. That's how you get out of my way so I can do my mission. That's your ministry. Are we willing to pay the cost of discipleship to get out of Jesus's way? To [00:21:00] channel his love, his justice, his power for our mother and father, for our spouse and children, for our brothers and sisters, and even today for those who declare us enemies.

Can we ourselves relinquish this lost predominant power that's inside us? This lost that Lincoln taught us we must relinquish in order to achieve our country. Or, will we allow ourselves to be seduced, to be intimidated, to surrender to those who see us now as enemies? Why? Because we refuse to serve their power love and instead hope in the power of servant love.

You know, this is a time for wokeness. for sleepers to awake. [00:22:00] It's a time for us to answer Jesus's claim upon our lives. Are we ready? Are we willing to make the sacrifices that God calls us to make for the world he loves so much?

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
