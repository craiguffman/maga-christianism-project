# Sermon 20220828-Up to 4K

[00:00:00] Please be seated.

I want you to imagine something that's not too hard for those of you who have been to California or out west recently. Sand, barren earth, dryness as far as you can see, thirst, the land filled with thirst, yearning for water. That's the metaphor that Jeremiah, the prophet, gives us as he talks to us. about God's feelings concerning our responsiveness to the covenant that God has made with us.

We thirst for the living water, but God says through the prophet, we have forsaken God. We have forsaken, in other words, [00:01:00] the spring of living water, and instead we have built cisterns. We created our own sources to hold water and the bad news that the prophet Jeremiah brings to us as he brings God's lawsuit against us, his indictment against us, is that move, you know, causes us to be guilty of two crimes.

First, we have forsaken the fountain of living water, and secondly, we have chosen instead Cisterns of water that are our own creation, that are doomed to crumble and crack and not even hold water. In fact, that's what the prophet says. We've trusted in cisterns that can't hold water. I wanna move today through a lot of scripture because there's some important things, I think in all of the of the scriptures today that speak to [00:02:00] our current situation here in the United States.

I want to remind us of what we hear in the, in the poem from Sirach, uh, that we read in our, in our traditional psalm location this morning. Human arrogance begins when people rebel, in other words, forsake God. That's human arrogance, the poet says. And when our hearts rebel against the one who made them.

And then the reminder that humans were not created to be arrogant, we were not created to be. And then that tough reading from the gospel of Mark, I hope you'll remember that from last year when we spent so much time carefully going through the entire gospel of Mark and we, we talked about this really.

Difficult story where, where Jesus is sitting there in the home of a friend and he's told that his mother and his brothers and sisters have arrived and they can't get into the house. And, and, uh, and, and [00:03:00] the crowd is, his disciples are expecting him to make way for them to bring them into the house and Jesus turns to them and says, Whoever does God's will is my brother, sister, and mother.

Not these. Blood relations, in other words, in which we have trusted. So Jesus, again, like the poet, like the prophet, brings an indictment against the people. Now, to get at why this might be true, what is the source of this indictment? I wanted to survey some scripture that I imagine you might not have read last night because it comes from, uh, the center of Torah, Leviticus.

And as you were, I'm sure, browsing through Leviticus 25 last night, Um, you, you would have seen, um, you know, something that we forget about in our own conversations that would have been presupposed as a, as an understanding of who the people are called to be. Just as you and I [00:04:00] presuppose in all of our undertakings that we are, as Americans, called to be a people who are living out what it means, trying to figure out what it means to be a people, uh, who live as though all people are created equal.

Uh, so too, we were called as the Israelites to be a people who worked out what it meant to be God's people and part of that outworking was Leviticus 25 where this idea of us being called to be a Sabbath people. Now you know what the Sabbath is I'm sure if I referred to that word you might think of well Sabbath means we worship on Sunday but that's actually our reduction of it to the trivial.

That makes it easy for us, but it's actually not what is intended at all in Torah. No, Sabbath living is, is our act of faithfulness, our act of trusting God, because it is something that Leviticus explains to us has a purpose, and that purpose is to train us into and to perform the act [00:05:00] of trusting in God to take care of us.

Trusting in God, learning to trust God to meet our needs, trusting that, that we can do this small set of things we are supposed to do and we can rest knowing that the world just might get along without us for a while while we rest. And so there's this idea of resting on the seventh day and the idea there is not that we.

We just simply take a nap, but that we trust in and we enjoy the world. We enjoy our life with God and we enjoy our life with each other, and that's the purpose of our living. And so we are to practice that and to perform it as a testimony to our ability to believe that the world will go on without us as we take time to rest.

But the reason I pointed to Leviticus 25 is that's just one aspect of Sabbath living. The other. Aspects of it are right there in Torah, calling us to not just have a Sabbath [00:06:00] day once every seven days, but to have a Sabbath year once every seven years. And in the seventh year, we are called once again to trust in God's provision by letting our lands go fallow, by not sowing new seed, by not harvesting a new crop.

But living off the land trusting as we did in all the wilderness periods of our lives That God will be who God has always been to us and provide for our needs in that seventh year And then if we were to read even more in Leviticus 25, we would see that there's not just a Sabbath year But there's a there's a Sabbath Jubilee and this is you know, there's seven, you know on the seventh day we rest in the seventh year we rest And on the seventh cycle of the Sabbath years, we not just rest, but we do something that is at the essence of who we're called to be, to completely trust God.

We have a jubilee year in which we are [00:07:00] all free. We celebrate how God frees us by forgiving each other of our debts. Anyone who is a slave is liberated. No one's, no one's period of servitude can go beyond that 50th year. If you have, because of your indebtedness, lost your lands due to the inability to pay, there is a point at which God says enough is enough and God restores you.

So in that jubilee year, you may have lost your land and the use of that land, but God says that's no one's land but mine. Anyone who is on it is simply have basically leasing it from me, God, and I, God, restore it in the 50th year. So as a result, no one would ever lose their right to participation in the promised land.

Every 50th year, no matter how low you had fallen, you would be restored. All your family lands would be [00:08:00] returned to you. Any debts that you had would be forgiven. And once again, all, all creatures, not just the humans, but the, the beast of burden would be, would be relieved of their duties of working in that year as we trusted on God to provide.

Now we don't know how well the Jews lived into that calling, into that vision for themselves that God had provided. And we do know that there were an awful lot of these prophetic lawsuits brought by God against us for our failure to be that kind of people. And we do know that Jesus turns to all the disciples who were relying on their blood, their tribal connections to, to, to protect their relationship to God and said, no, those who do God's will are my brother and my sister.

[00:09:00] And so, this notion of Jubilee is at the very heart of what it means to be a Jew and what it means, the very heart of what it means to be a Christian. This notion of Jubilee is the background behind so many of Jesus's parables. And you'll remember some of them because we've walked through them so many times.

Remember the parable of the unforgiving, I mean, of the, yes, of the unforgiving servant that didn't. In, uh, chapter 18 of Matthew's gospel, uh, there, the entire chapter is all about forgiveness, and Jesus teaches us, uh, what is basically liturgy of reconciliation, how we are to behave when we sin against each other.

And then, and then he talks about our need to forgive one another. And he tells this parable that presupposes this forgiveness of debts that I just described. He tells the story about the servant who owed a king. Now get this. I want you to imagine this, 10, [00:10:00] 000 bags of gold. Can we fit that, that many bags of gold in this building?

10, 000 bags of gold. That's his indebtedness to the king. But he can't pay it back. He comes before the king and says, okay, I'm going to sell your family, all of you and everything you own in, you know, and then we'll take the proceeds and pay off your debt. And as you can imagine, the man says, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I, I, I, I can't survive.

And he makes an appeal and the king has compassion on him and says, I forgive your debt. I forgive your debt. And they carry on. But the problem is, as you know, that servant then goes and meets a fellow servant of his, one who has a similar location. This man owes him. Now get this. The equivalent of 100, not bags of gold, not 10, 000 bags of gold, but 100, the equivalent of 100 pennies.

He owes him a buck. Pay [00:11:00] up now. The man said, I can't. He, so he grabs him by the neck and demands it, and then he throws him as was his due into debtor's prison.

Of course, those colleagues of his saw this and they let the king know about it, as you know. And the king comes to him and says, you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you appealed to me. Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you? And then, you know what he said, he handed the, that man, that wicked servant over to the guard responsible for punishing prisoners until he had paid the whole debt.

And lest we don't. See how central this habit this practice is to us. Let's recall in in in Luke chapter 11 verse 4 That where Jesus is teaching us how to pray And in the Greek not the one that not the one that's in the book common prejudice [00:12:00] before the book of common prayer was there there was actually Jesus saying these things teaching us.

So our book of common prayer has a has a version of the Lord's Prayer that is It's more convenient for us than it really, the words that are really there. We say, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. But in the gospel of Luke, what it actually says is it asks God to forgive us our hermarsha, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who are indebted to us.

So we understand that there's a connection between our being forgiven for sin. In our practice of forgiving each other of what is due us. And then of course, I could go on and on, but I have to bring us to, uh, a parable that we're gonna hear soon in the gospel. One of, you know, the one that I think is the most powerful piece, it's really the centerpiece of Mark's portrait of who [00:13:00] Jesus was, the, the parable of the two prodigal sons.

Now, we, we often think of the one son, and I'm not going to go through the whole story. You know the story. It's the story of the younger son who had his inheritance and wasted it and came back in conniving way, tried to get back in his father's good graces. And we see that wonderful story of his father acting gracefully.

And the part that we often don't focus on is about the other prodigal son who had a great inheritance, but somehow had learned nothing from that. And so when he sees his little brother being treated with grace, he raises an incredible objection. He says, Listen, for all these years I have been working like a slave for you and I have never disobeyed your command, yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends.

But when this son of yours arrives, who has devoured your property, consorted with prostitutes, you [00:14:00] killed the fatted calf for him. And the father says, son, you are always with me. All that is mine is already yours. But we have to celebrate and rejoice because this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life.

He was lost and now he's found.

Forgiveness. is the generative principle of Christianity. Grace, as we've talked about in the last several sermons, gives us the freedom to respond to Christ's claim on us by living as Christ lives with us, living as folks who have been forgiven ourselves and therefore forgive others. And [00:15:00] what that means is, connecting it with Leviticus 25, that forgiveness means Sabbath living, trusting that God will make the world turn out just fine in spite of our anxiety about what might happen if we forgive others.

This week I've been reminded of one of the stories I told you about a few weeks ago. That story that happened in Germany in the thirties, 1930s, that church, that German church, you see, lost its bearing. It lost its saltiness. It no longer kept its distinction from the nation state, from the German culture.

It went along with the emerging cultural norms, which as you recall, had to do with a lot of xenophobia and racism. And it embraced that and brought it into the [00:16:00] church rather than resisting it. And, and you may remember the story I told you was how the culture said to it, we need to purify ourselves. We can no longer tolerate in leadership positions, anyone but the finest among us and the finest among us are Aryan and therefore church, get rid of all those Jewish Christian.

who are serving as ordained ministers in the German church. Do you remember that? And the tragic reality is that the church went along with the winds of the culture. It didn't resist. And so it asked those pastors to understand. And you know the rest of that story. What they could have done, what they should have done is remembered their baptismal vows.

You who were [00:17:00] baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ and therefore there is no longer Jew nor Greek, no longer slave nor free, for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. That's what they should have done. But by allowing their secular culture to decide that Jewish Christian pastors could no longer serve in faith.

German Christian churches, they lost their way. They didn't trust Jesus. They trusted their secular culture. Instead of trusting in the living water, the spring of Living water that was right there, they built a cistern that could hold no water.

This week we've seen extreme anger and remembering Ciroc, the poet. Arrogance in response to the Biden debt relief plan. Now, [00:18:00] much of that anger is because the centerpiece of that plan is debt forgiveness. And for many, that seems unfair. Like the laborers in the vineyard who were angry that those who came after them got a great deal that they didn't get.

It feels like, as many have said, a slap in the face. It's unmerited. I did things the right way by working hard and paying off my student loans. This younger generation has done far less to merit forgiveness of their loans than I have done in my life. Now you want to give them part of the fatted calf that you should be giving to me?

That's outrageous. Now, I want to be very clear right now, I am not, and I have no intention of speaking about the relative merits of the [00:19:00] Biden debt relief plan. We need to deliberate about that as a nation, discern whether its mechanics will actually address our dysfunctional approach to financing our higher education for our, for our youth.

That's not my purpose here. But what I do want to do is challenge our fellow Christians who indulge their anger in categorically rejecting and being angered by its reliance on something that is so central to our way of being, forgiveness, in particular, debt forgiveness. My challenge to you, if that's where you are today, is to ask yourself, to what extent is your thinking, simply you being blown off course by the winds of our secular world, to what extent does your thinking reflect your responses to that rather than your [00:20:00] responses to Jesus's claims on your life about who you will be?

Forgiveness is perhaps the hardest thing that we do. How often in our private relationships do we act like that older brother and refuse to welcome back into our lives those whose behavior seems not to warrant forgiveness, doesn't warrant forgiveness. That sibling who went AWOL, absent without leave, who went about doing their own thing while we were doing the much harder right thing, taking care of mom and dad.

That lover who failed to live up to our marriage vows, while we were faithful, while we were responsible and loving to them. Family members who failed to give us the love, the respect that we deserve. At such [00:21:00] times, our temptation is always there to indulge our anger, to insist that others get their due.

to demand that justice be done. But when we think of justice that way, we are embracing our secular cultures, understanding of what justice is. The idea that persons should get what they deserve. No more and no less. That's what's Underlying, I think, so much of the anger that we're seeing. This secular understanding of what justice is.

But brothers and sisters, if God gave us what we deserve, we'd be wiped out. As Jeremiah says, if God held us accountable for our debts, our lives would be bankrupt. Grace [00:22:00] is unmerited. But it's not irresponsible. It's responsible and responsive to the utmost. Grace always does that which makes new life together possible.

Our secular brothers and sisters think justice is each of us getting what we deserve, no more no less, but the justice that we understand and we're called to proclaim to the world is the one that we see on the cross. And it's not like that. The cross teaches us that justice is that act in every moment which makes reconciled life together possible when it seems impossible.

Justice, in other words, creates the conditions of our life together so that it might be reborn when it's broken. And so a just person does not give someone [00:23:00] what they're due. A just person figures out in each moment how to create the conditions that are needed for ongoing, for ongoing reconciled life to carry on.

And then they do that. That's what a just person does. And that's where forgiving, as we are forgiven, comes in. Forgiving each other's debts sounds like foolishness to the Greeks, as Paul said in his letter to the Church of Corinth. But it is at the very heart of the good news that you and I are called to embody.

It's our generative principle. Secular justice is so much easier. It's so much easier to be blown by that wind. But it does not lead us to the living waters. The justice that Christ commands us to [00:24:00] embody is much harder. And that's why faith means what Leviticus 25 says it is. Trusting that God will make the world turn out just fine in spite of our anxieties about forgiving others.

And so brothers and sisters who are feeling this anger, what I say to you is that's not who we are called to be. That is not who we are called to be. It's ironic to me to hear a Christian express anger at the idea of forgiveness and at the same time insist that America should be a Christian nation. For the patriotic task of the church.

is not to make America more Christian. The patriotic task of the church is to create such just people that [00:25:00] secular America sees the difference and recognizes what secular means. That's our task. We Christians do that by living as a people who forgive as we are forgiven. That's how we do our job. In other words, the patriotic task for American Christians is to participate in American democracy as brothers and sisters of a Christocracy.

We serve our nation best by, by refusing to be tossed and blown around by every wind. By following Jesus alone as our head. That's what a Christocracy is. That's what we're called to have and to be. Not the nation, but us Christians are called to be that we serve our nation best by refusing the temptation to become the Democratic party at worship or the Republican [00:26:00] party at worship by understanding our primary identity as neither Republican nor Democrat, but crat.

Those who practice the politics of Jesus, in other words, as we participate in the politics of America. For when we take our lead from the latest talking points of either party, rather than from Jesus, we abdicate our responsibility to our country. We abdicate our responsibility to each other to speak the truth to our nation in love.

And if we take our lead from Jesus, we won't indulge in anger at the idea of forgiveness, at the idea of second chances for any citizen. Rather, as Paul reminds us in his letter to the church at Ephesus this morning, we [00:27:00] are about the project of seeking to become mature, as measured by the fullness of the heart.

of Christ, and we do that by building up each other, not taking each other down, by building each other up in love, and by doing our part to grow the whole body in love. The motto, brothers and sisters, the motto of secular America is live and let live. As American Christians, let our most Let us be our most patriotic and holy self and when we are our most patriotic and holy self we say instead live and help live May we always live and help live in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit.

[00:28:00] Amen
