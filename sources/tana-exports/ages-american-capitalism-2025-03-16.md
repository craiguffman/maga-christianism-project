  - **Citation key**: levy2021ages
  - **Atomic Description**: Levy created "a single-volume history of the United States" that traces our "economic life" from colonial settlement to the Great Recession by focusing on four ages: Commerce, Capital, Control, and Chaos. He describes our economic life as driven by "a never-ending conflict between the short-term propensity to hoard and the long-term ability and inducement to invest" capital, a conflict that explains our "periods of long-term economic development and... repeating booms and busts."
  - **Structural Order**: 
    - Introduction
      - Intro.1 - Capitalism, a Definition
        - Levy notes that [Capitalism](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=x8B17aMq_5) is a contested term. He introduces key concepts, like his distinctive definition of [Capital](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=wqt4TUEiTkYH) . He introduces three theses:
          - [Thesis #1: Rather than a physical factor of production, a thing, capital is a process. Specifically, capital is the process through which a legal asset is invested with pecuniary value, in light of its capacity to yield a future pecuniary profit.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=hPDtSBreedIW)
      - Intro.2 - The Profit Motive, Key But Not Enough
        - Levy makes the huge point that the Rational Man model I learned is a "common misconception."
        - [one common misconception is that capital is only a factor of production, then another is the belief in the purely rational psychology of all economic agents, including capitalists. Here the general picture is of capitalists who, like great calculating machines, are always sufficiently motivated to rationally invest their capital in pursuit of the highest possible pecuniary return, or profit. Economic efficiency results.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=FITT3VzBZOkw)
        - [the working assumption that even the greatest capitalists of all time have always been purely rationally motivated to maximize their profits at all costs and against all other considerations simply does not hold up on historical scrutiny. The ideological belief that a capitalist economy is governed by a rational economic calculus intrinsic to our natures and dedicated to the pursuit of moneymaking is so deep-seated in our culture that it can be difficult to shake.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=uSTuBpocv-0a)
        - For example:
          - [slave owners were entrepreneurial capitalists who eyed their bottom lines, even as they were motivated by, among other things, their quest for racial domination.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=2qzaGSYQ1VrM)
        - [Thesis #2: Capital is defined by the quest for a future pecuniary profit. WIthout capital's habitual quest for pecuniary gain, there is no capitalism. But the profit motive of capitalists has never been enough to drive economic history, not even the history of capitalism.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=LJN0Pp-mQ764)
        - [capital‚Äôs quest for pecuniary gain has always been complicated by a great variety of rational and irrational human motivations‚Äîsometimes energized by them and sometimes, as we shall see, enervated. Though it exists, the profit motive has always been entangled in complicated ways with larger individual and collective projects.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=lBftZsbAyqXN)
        - [what separates the ages of American capitalism, I will argue, are not strictly economic variables but rather political initiatives: the British Empire‚Äôs mercantilist project of the 1660s, as it transformed its fledgling North American colonies; the electoral triumph of the antislavery Republican Party in 1860s, and the secession of southern slave states; the New Deal of the 1930s, responding to the Great Depression; and the beginning of the Volcker interest rate shock of 1979, followed by the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=sO_QgjWo5XLU)
      - Intro.3 - The Economic Problem
        - [Economic growth, an increase in the value of production per head over time, is one of capitalism‚Äôs distinguishing characteristics, and high rates of growth have long distinguished the American economy from others. But capitalist development has always been punctuated by repeating cycles of boom and bust.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=2u5GPJMn6zCl)
        - [Thesis #3: The history of capitalism is a never-ending conflict between the short-term propensity to hoard and the long-term ability and inducement to invest. This conflict holds the key to explaining many of the dynamics of capitalism over time, including its periods of long-term economic development and growth, and its repeating booms and busts.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=gBE6Sep7u53f)
        - [The gist of thesis three was first suggested‚Äîonly dashed off, really‚Äîby Keynes during the Great Depression. Buried in a paragraph near the end of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), Keynes speculated: "There has been a chronic tendency throughout human history for the propensity to save to be stronger than the inducement to invest. The weakness of the inducement to invest has been at all times the key to the economic problem."14](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=M6db_WWTBUfG)
        - [The reason the inducement to invest for the long term is weak, Keynes argued, is that the short-term ‚Äúliquidity preference‚Äù of the owners of capital is usually stronger.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=DA0d8zxEfsH5)
        - This leads Levy to explain [Liquidity](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=2js6nZkdLA69) in some detail.

        - Scholars can't agree on what to call our new economy. Certain backward-looking names are apt except that they refer to what it's not, rather than what it is. Examples include "postindustrialist" and "postFordist." Names that refer to it a repeat of a past period don't work either, such as "Second Gilded Age" and "neoliberalism."

                  - ["the difference between Niebuhr and Barth is exactly the difference between a theology that has given up on its ability to tell us the way the world is and a theology that confidently and unapologetically proclaims the way things are - a distinction that is unintelligible if the God Christians worship does not exist."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Qx1cRCZwn4)
                  - ["That is the heart of Niebuhr's ethics. Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized virtue of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance. Catholicism, the Renaissance, Calvinism, and the sectarian Protestants: Niebuhr judges them all to be mistaken attempts to make an ethic of sanctification a reality. These historical options, to be sure in quite different ways, result in a false attempt to make history conform to perfect love, or frustrated by the attempt, their adherents undertake an irresponsible withdrawal from the world."](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=4s12KykKAO)

                  - [In the preface to his published 2001 Gifford lectures, Stanley Hauerwas emphasized how important it is for Christians to remember that theology is a means, not an end. The end is prayer, which is simultaneously our posture and substance whenever we are fully human. Therefore, he cautions us against staking out theological positions more settled than prayer. The point is not to ensure we hold orthodox positions but to help us converse with God in faithful prayer.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=jdlfnEpjE9)

Fast-moving money, rapid investment and disinvestment, across various asset classes, as well as in and out of various companies, has not only overturned old methods of production‚Äîits logic has often threatened to overwhelm other economic patterns.

        - The shift in the logic of valuation dramatically impacted laborers, especially in the manufacturing sector. The path to income growth diverged.

Without that belief, confidence fails and investors rapidly "shift from speculative to precautionary liquidity preference." Investment booms end.

        - [During the 1990s, by contrast with the more improvisational Reagan administration, the ‚ÄúNew Democrats‚Äù of President Bill Clinton articulated a coherent political-economic settlement for the new age. Clinton went all in on a finance- and technology-driven, center-left vision of ‚Äúglobalization.‚Äù This was a global economy, still dominated by the United States, of newfound fluidity, flow, energy, and risk. There was movement of global capital, of goods across borders due to new free trade agreements, and if to a lesser degree also of immigrants‚Äîlegal and illegal.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=04ZS5xod4Hsb)
        - [The era of ‚ÄúBig Government,‚Äù Clinton declared, was over.

        - [the relationship between investment and enterprise changed. Often, the valuation of Silicon Valley‚Äìbased technology companies hinged on the prospective value of the innovative ‚Äúideas‚Äù of entrepreneurs‚Äîrather than the past generation of business profits. New, intangible forms of capital, like ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù and the ‚Äúsocial capital‚Äù that connected Silicon Valley‚Äôs recombinant networks of relationships, appreciated. Everywhere, online and off, the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù became the new organizing principle of business for increasingly multinational U.S. corporations, but also in social life more generally.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=oXutBEmEBxTP)

        - [A historically low short-term interest rate from the Fed supported a genuine worldwide economic boom, centered on the rise of China as a world manufacturing power after its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Regions of China became ever more linked to U.S. multinational supply chains, as Chinese producers exported such things as flat-screen televisions and, beginning in 2007, Apple‚Äôs iPhone, into the great U.S. consumer market. To help finance U.S. consumption and to accumulate dollar-denominated assets‚Äîthe world‚Äôs safest, most risk-free, liquid investment‚ÄîChina also began to export prodigious amounts of its savings into the U.S. capital market. That helped hold down long-term interest rates as well.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=McBF19IQWARk)
        - [Bernanke was correct that in addition to price stability and low inflation, the 2000s expansion shared many qualities with those since 1982. What he did not emphasize was that the pattern of economic development continued to be asset-led and therefore new income gains flowed largely to the best-off, who by now increasingly tended to be highly educated, and lived in those cities where the new economy thrived. In those places where it did not, economic life suffered.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Ul2UkPTPD7Cw)

        - [In the 2000s, however, there was a genuine attempt to fling open the economy of asset price appreciation to a broader constituency, through the vehicle of home ownership. It was the economic apogee of ‚Äúfamily values.‚Äù Aided by the low global interest rates of the 2000s and favorable government policies encouraging home ownership, residential real estate prices began to soar nationwide‚Äîalthough, as in Jefferson‚Äôs time, white households disproportionately benefited from the surge in wealth.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=e2cVdqvwrLVo)
        - [many households whose labor earnings were stagnant used debt to purchase or refinance homes, hoping to sustain consumption through asset price appreciation.
