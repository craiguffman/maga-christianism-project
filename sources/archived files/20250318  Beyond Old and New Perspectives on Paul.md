### Highlights

- With narrowed eyes, they continue: “So, you’re saying that both the Reformation and the New Perspective on Paul have it wrong? And you think you have it right?!” ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=131))
- And the ‘new perspective,’ which doesn’t even exist in the singular, is really a group of very different scholarly positions united by a new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. And they are likewise helpful. They saw some very real problems associated with the so-called ‘old perspective,’ particularly its portrayal of ‘the Jew.’ ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=134))
- finally add: “At least this is what Douglas Campbell argues. He presents a complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware, and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both.” ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=139))
- it is fair to say that Campbell’s work has generated a very mixed response! And though I would argue that much of the criticism has been less than helpful and has not always represented his position accurately, Deliverance is of such significance (not to mention sheer size!) that it requires the attention and sustained consideration of the scholarly community. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=154))
- If Douglas is right, I mused, then understanding Paul is about being more profoundly Christ-centered than I had ever anticipated. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=176))
- Despite Tomlin’s appreciation for Campbell’s handling of Luther, he argues that Luther is not an example of a mix of contractual and unconditional theology, as Campbell suggests. The contractual contours of Justification Theory are simply never present in Luther. The reformer indeed fights them. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=197))
- Campbell’s strong distinction between the “Justification Theory” dynamics inherent in traditional readings of Romans 1–4, and the “alternative gospel” of Romans 5–8, has been rejected by most reviewers. To clarify his argument, Campbell claims that the apocalyptic or alternative gospel is Athanasian in its theological heart, while Romans 1–4, traditionally understood, involves Arian methodological commitments. These are not, in other words, readings “in tension” with one another, but ones with fundamentally irreconcilable accounts of theology. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=202))
- Although Campbell’s position is endorsed in a number of ways, I raise questions about the appropriateness of Campbell’s vectorial language (“forward”/“backward” thinking). ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=207))
- Smith is in overall sympathy with Campbell’s concerns and suggests that, instead of speaking of Arian Foundationalism versus Athanasian Apocalypticism, “Campbell would be better served to speak of a Eunomian Rationalism vs. a Nicene Apocalypticism or a Nicene Economic Theology.” ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=211))

- She draws lines of connection between Campbell’s account of foundationalism, on the one hand, and various modern trends in American Christianity, on the other, particularly those aspects that tend to moralistic, therapeutic deism and America’s “legal mind.” ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=224))
- a subtle misconstrual of Paul’s argument has led to a massive distortion of Paul’s theology. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=229))

- classicist Robin Griffith-Jones analyzes a number of texts that Campbell refers to as support for his claim that speech-in-character, prosopopoeia, would have been recognized in Romans 1:18–32 by Paul’s original auditors. He examines Cicero, Quintilian, Seneca, and other relevant texts, and maintains that it is unlikely Paul would have deployed a long block-speech with no clear introduction, that is, without introducing and identifying the speaker. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=236))
- His analysis then turns to examine the noun phrase, the “the righteousness of God,” and the cognate verb, δικαιόω. Drawing on his more extensive work in Deliverance, Campbell’s methodologically nuanced approach leads him to understand the noun phrase as a singular, saving, liberating, life-giving, eschatological, and resurrecting event. His examination of the cognate verb leads to the conclusion that construals of Paul’s language, in terms of a Western legal and conditional narrative, is wrongheaded. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=249))

- I finish by reflecting on the claims of Francis Watson, concluding that although the so-called pistis Christou debate is far from over, Campbell’s treatment of the data is compelling. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=261))
- the argumentation of this book is driven by a theological critique of certain key methodological, epistemological, and indeed, ontological suppositions that have functioned to sustain what Campbell calls “justification discourse”—an approach to Pauline interpretation that Campbell argues is outmoded, confused, and ultimately incoherent. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=321))
- core concerns of this book? The first is to expose the fallacious reasoning underpinning justification theory as this has characterized Pauline scholarship since the Reformation. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=324))
- Justification theory or discourse, Campbell argues, has provided the Western church with an interpretive framework that has distorted the core of Paul’s theology and notably its ethical, anthropological, theological, soteriological, and epistemological implications. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=325))
- The second related aim is to solve the problem of the apparent tension between Romans 1:18–32, on the one hand, which underpins justification theory, and Romans 5–8 (anticipated in 3:21–26), which he sees as expounding the glorious heart of Pauline theology—his profound, apocalyptic, and participative vision of the gospel. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=327))
- Although the tension here was already recognized by Deissmann, Schweitzer, Wrede, and others, none of the revisionist scholars who challenged the justification discourse offered a “satisfactory explanation of how the two discourses, forensic and mystical, might fit together either in Romans or in Paul’s thinking about salvation as a whole.” ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=335))
- Campbell’s solution to this tension is to argue that the early chapters of Romans are a kind of rhetorical exposé of a legalistic “alternative gospel” that is not the gospel Paul himself is proclaiming. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=338))
- What must be clear to all is that justification discourse does not simply emerge in a spontaneous and unmediated way from Pauline texts. It is a theological doctrine, formulated on the basis of a series of theological premises, which addresses a particular problem, and is driven by a whole series of apologetic and other concerns. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=350))
- Lying behind the relevant theological moves is one of the tragedies of Western thought, namely, the manner in which theological and biblical interpretation has been driven by the mistranslation of Hebrew terms—let me mention three in particular. First, berith, as it is used in the Pentateuch to denote the Lord’s relationship to Israel, denotes an unconditioned and unconditional covenant commitment to Israel grounded in love and characterized by hesed—God’s sustained and unconditional covenant faithfulness. Berith in Hebrew and diatheke in Greek, were translated foedus in Latin, giving rise to federal theology. Foedus makes no distinction between covenant and contract and essentially means “contract.” Subliminal within the Western tradition, not least the Calvinist tradition, as Campbell so rightly argues, was a contractual model of the relationship between God and Israel—contract of nature, contract of faith, etc. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=353))

- This brings us to the next key moves in the reasoning of the justification discourse, namely, what Campbell describes as the introspective twist (DofG, 28) and the loop of despair (DofG, 29)—that is, self-perceived ethical incapacity (DofG, 34), the awareness that we violate God’s ethical demands and that a negative divine judgement is unavoidable. On this basis, the gift of grace is then presented—the “compensatory mechanism of satisfaction, namely, Christ’s atonement” (DofG, 34) whereby God redirects that punishment which is our due to Christ (who dies) and his righteousness to us, who are sinners but who are now viewed as if his righteousness were theirs. It is at precisely this point, however, that we are presented with a second contract, what the Calvinists referred to as the contract of faith (foedus fidei).

Or that it could be promulgated by Afrikaner Calvinists in one of the most Christian countries in the world, who believed that God’s purposes for the state, vis-à-vis race, should be determined in advance of any mediation of God’s creative purposes in Christ by appeal to the cultural mandates… ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=407))

- Third, there are the assumptions vis-à-vis the doctrine of God.

The result, is that the gospel, as Paul would have it, finds itself presented with a Procrustean bed—molded to fit our… ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=431))

    - **Tags:** #pink
- Romans 5–8 and, indeed, so much else in the Pauline corpus suggests that a reverent Pauline hermeneutic constitutes a form of Nachdenken—reflection after the event of God’s self-disclosure in Christ and emphatically not an attempt to accommodate or subject the testimony to that self-disclosure within a series of pre-established vestibules that appeal to prior, unreconciled worldviews. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=444))
- In short, the direction of the pressure of interpretation must be from Paul’s central affirmations vis-à-vis the nature of God, humanity, law, ethics, and the nature of epistemic access as these are given en Christo and not to these notions from conceptions dictated by our prior natural reasoning. This is the underlying concern in Campbell’s repudiation of “foundationalism.” ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=447))
- We are obliged to consider our prior epistemic states, affiliations, and suppositions from an apocalyptic deliverance in which salvation is proclaimed as having arrived unconditionally, ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=453))

    - **Tags:** #pink
- We find an event of atonement symbolized by metaphors signifying the death of the old and our rising with Christ—denoting genuine discontinuity with our prior states and orientation. The new situation, moreover, turns out to be an essentially koinonial, relational, and interpersonal form of existence rooted in the divine communion. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=456))
- In stark contrast, the “natural” individualistic state is seen to be subject to hostile powers, enslaved by sinful passions—an old, unredeemed humanity that cannot comprehend the nature of the problem, let alone the solution. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=458))
- Old ways of thinking are hostile and erroneous, condemned to follow a confused trajectory that needs to be “metamorphozed” for the discernment of truth—emphatically not “securitized” with reference to the unredeemed, natural order (Rom 12:2). ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=460))
- such perceptions are fundamentally discontinuous with our prior suppositions about the way God is, how we are created to be, the character of ethical existence, etc. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=463))
- those prior suppositions reflect the alienated mind and do not constitute an appropriate vestibule for interpreting atonement, ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=465))
- The ramifications of this move are immense, not only for epistemology, anthropology, and the doctrine of God (God is no longer conceived as essentially the God of retributive justice), ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=467))
- also Christology (no longer monopolized by his death to satisfy retributive requirements), soteriology, faith, assurance, sanctification, the sacraments, and so on. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=468))
- The danger of the nature-grace model is inevitably that a prior, alienated conception of the self serves as the foundation for Paul’s vision of the new humanity, which then comes to be conceived in supererogatory terms and not as defining God’s creative purposes for humanity per se! ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=469))
- To understand Campbell’s argument is to be persuaded that we must be consistent in our interpretation of Paul by conceiving of the pre-Christian state in the light of what it is to be human in truth—and not the other way round.

- a basic distinction between two modes of doing theology—one that is referred to frequently in this volume under the rubric of Athanasius versus Arius, ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=481))
- the difference between two fundamentally different ways of understanding, learning about, and talking of the God acting in Jesus Christ. It is this distinction and these two fundamental modes of knowing and speaking that are ultimately at issue in the different ways of reading Paul ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=483))
- many of the responses to my work, both here and in other contexts, simply deny this difference and/or its importance. Alan suggests here quite clearly in my view that this difference remains both fundamental and critical, while any denials of its nature and/or importance risk being deeply confused and distressingly misleading, at least in ecclesial terms. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=486))
- Specifically he affirms the accuracy and importance of distinguishing between fundamentally different theological modes when interpreting Paul. Not infrequently, when struggling to communicate clearly about such matters, I refer to these two modes and the distinction between them as the difference between Paul thinking “forward,” at least in relation to a certain problem, as against thinking “backward” (utilizing here terminology originally developed by E. P. Sanders). ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=1439))
- The former mode, limiting it appropriately to epistemological dynamics, would then be foundationalist, is more specifically also often contractual, and would be methodologically Arian, and the latter would be non-foundationalist and (christologically) revelational, unconditional, and methodologically Athanasian. Hence the former, “forward” mode is an undesirable one from an orthodox theological point of view, the latter, “backward” one desirable, and the presence of both within Paul’s thought—and especially within the same letter—evidence of distressing confusion in his thinking. ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=1442))
- Ultimately, Nicene Christianity distinguished between theologia, discussion of God’s nature, from oikonomia, indirect knowledge of God’s being through God’s creative, redemptive, and divinizing activities or energeia revealed in the unfolding plan of salvation in the narrative of Scripture. Campbell, therefore, is correct that Arius and Athanasius represent not only competing Christologies but also competing theological methodologies—methodologies that resonate with competing nineteenth- and twentieth-century theological methods and epistemologies (e.g., Barth vs. Brunner) that have informed modern readings of Romans.

- Methodological Arianism is Campbell’s term for the contractual foundationalism that imposes upon Romans a view of justice from social contract theory of the Western Liberal tradition, grounded in a theory of natural law and a natural knowledge of God’s righteousness—knowledge universally available and thus outside the revelation of God’s covenantal relationship with Israel and the church. This theory of natural law becomes the foundation of the Western ordo salutis. ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=1992))

- The alternative to Methodological Arianism is Athanasian Apocalypticism that roughly corresponds to the Pneumatologically Participatory Martyrological Eschatology (of the PPME Model) Campbell advanced in The Quest for Paul’s Gospel.

- God’s redemptive work is not regulated or conditioned by a system of justice that is external to God. Rather God’s election of the saints by which they are incorporated into the covenantal relationship with God is purely gratuitous—the overflow of his benevolence. The righteousness of God, therefore, is entirely apocalyptic. It can be grasped, not by appealing to some natural law conception of justice, but solely in God’s self-revelation in Christ.

- As Campbell nicely puts it, because God’s unconditional love is the foundation of God’s work of deliverance, “[no] criteria for [salvation’s] activation, appropriation, or reception by humans are apparent, while what causality or agency is apparent is attributed to God.”172 ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=2001))

- Following the apophatic tradition of Middle Platonism, all human beings can say about God in se is how he is unlike us: immaterial, incorruptible, immutable, impassible, and most of all ingenerate (agennētos). Such negative terminology does not tell us what God is; it merely purifies our thinking about God by removing any erroneous comparisons between God and ourselves.

- Arius is equally as insistent as Athanasius upon the apocalyptic nature of our knowledge of God. The chief difference is that for Athanasius the Logos cannot properly reveal God the Father or allow us to participate in the divine nature unless the Logos is equal in divinity with the Father.

- There is, however, another figure and school of thought in the fourth century that represents the error that Campbell attributes to Arius, namely Eunomius of Cyzicus and the Heterousians. The Heterousians—also called Neo-Arians or Anomoians or Eunomians—represent the third generation of Anti-Nicene subordinationists.175 ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=2021))
- God’s uniqueness, for Eunomius, lay in being unbegotten, that is, uncaused or conditioned by anything external to himself. From this position he rejected the Nicene claim that Father and Son are consubstantial (homoousios). ([Location 2030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=2030))
- If the Father’s essence is his being unbegotten and the Son is called the “Only-begotten,” then by definition the Unbegotten Father and Only-begotten Son are of different essences and so unlike each other. Since God is simple, he concludes, attributes such as incorruptible or impassible are not real, discrete properties of God, but only human conceptualizations (epinoia). ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=2032))

- The refutation of Aetius and Eunomius fell to the Cappadocians, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa. The dispute between the Eunomians and the Cappadocians focused as much on assumptions about the nature of theology and the human capacity to know God as it did about competing interpretations of biblical claims about the person of Christ Jesus.

- Moreover, Basil employs not a minimalist view of essence as a single distinguishing feature, but a maximalist view. God’s essence is identical with God’s being, that is, with everything that God is. Since God is infinite, his being cannot be comprehended by the finite human intellect. Consequently, since God’s essence is unknowable, either reductively or comprehensively, Eunomius cannot claim that the Unbegotten Father and the Only-begotten Son are not consubstantial.

- When humanity sinned and turned away from God, human existence became characterized by evil. Our likeness to God began to diminish. The rational image of God, in which we were made so that we might know God and participate in God’s life-sustaining grace, was compromised. Consequently, our knowledge of God also waned.194 Unable to know and participate in God, human nature became corrupt. Losing its ability to participate in God, humanity began to slide back into non-being. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=2156))

- Athanasius allows that, although God is “by nature invisible and incomprehensible, having his being beyond all created existence,” the Creator so ordered the universe that “one ought to perceive God its maker and artificer, even though [God] be not seen with the bodily eyes.”195 Not surprisingly, he supports this claim by quoting Romans 1:20. After the fall, however, humanity retained the knowledge that God existed but they lacked true knowledge of what or who God is. They developed a corrupt view of the Divine. Since in sin their minds were focused on the material world, they came to conceive of the incorporeal God in corporeal terms. So they crafted wooden or stone representations of God as non-rational animals. In other words, because of sin human beings were unable to know God rightly through nature. Instead of seeing God’s power reflected in nature and so reasoning inductively from their knowledge of the creature to the Creator, humanity imputed to God the qualities of unstable and corruptible material creation.

- To put it another way, by revealing the Father in a way that enables us to reason rightly about God, the Divine Logos restores our ability to contemplate God.

We are able to participate in the divine nature by being conformed to the image of God revealed in Christ Jesus only because the Son is equal in divinity with the Father.

- For Athanasius, by contrast, idolatry is a failure to act rightly that results from a failure to see and know God rightly. He does not deny that creation reveals God’s power and righteousness; rather sin has distorted human thinking, creating a carnal orientation of the mind and materialistic habits of thought that prevent us from receiving God’s self-disclosure in the visible creation. The Logos sets our thinking about God aright and raises our thoughts above the visible creation to the invisible Creator by giving us a proper vision of the Father. This is possible only because the Logos abided with us, assuming a sensible form in the material creation upon which our carnal minds are fixated.

([Location 3169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=3169))

- Such readings lead, inter alia, to an individualistic view of salvation in which the gospel is not freely given, but necessitated because of human sinfulness. ([Location 4401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=4401))

- Like Ernst Käsemann, J. Louis Martyn, and other proponents of an apocalyptic Paul, I use the term “apocalyptic” to reference the radical disclosure of God’s salvific righteousness in Jesus Christ. ([Location 4666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=4666))
- This construal will release foundationalism in its own right, in the specific form of course of Western contractualism, although it may form an alliance with a more general commitment on the part of Paul’s interpreter to a fundamentally rationalistic and moralistic, and invariably quite individualizing, anthropology—a conception of the human person that primarily governs itself, which is deeply congenial to modern thought and culture (repeated critiques notwithstanding). ([Location 4770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=4770))
- This type of anthropology will lead Paul’s interpreter to read him “forward” as well, as an essentially autonomous individual sets off on a quest for salvation, driven and governed by her own conceptions. ([Location 4773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=4773))
- But long before then, Karl Barth had already shaped my theological imagination to think about Paul’s gospel as the revelation of God’s righteousness “through his faithfulness in Jesus Christ.” ([Location 6298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6298))
- And following Barth, Thomas Torrance argued that Paul’s radical theology presented “the incarnate faithfulness of God” in Jesus as the turning point of the world’s salvation. ([Location 6300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6300))
- I think I understand why evangelicals have such a hard time making sense of Campbell’s account of “the faith of Jesus Christ” or his larger argument for “the deliverance of God” in Jesus Christ. The answer is simple, although it will no doubt be disputed. ([Location 6306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6306))
- Evangelicals do not understand Campbell’s argument because: (1) evangelical theology is functionally unitarian rather than Trinitarian, and (2) evangelical theology is crucicentric rather than incarnational. ([Location 6308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6308))
- evangelical theology, and popular evangelical religion more specifically, is not Trinitarian. The Jesus piety of most evangelicals leans toward what H. Richard Niebuhr once described as a unitarianism of the second person. ([Location 6313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6313))
- In short, the doctrine of the Trinity is not clearly and succinctly stated as a whole in any one biblical text. And because evangelical theology is based on explicit biblical warrant, it is not clearly and explicitly Trinitarian. Jesus, however, is central to the biblical canon. Thus, evangelicalism is committed to a functional unitarianism in which the devotion and commitment to Jesus is central. ([Location 6317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6317))
- Lacking a rich Trinitarian theology, contemporary evangelicals are at a loss to understand salvation through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. ([Location 6331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6331))
- To put this in terms of Campbell’s models, without a Trinitarian theology there is no Pneumatologically Participatory Martyrological Eschatology (PPME) in Paul’s gospel. ([Location 6332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6332))
- And without an inchoate Pauline Trinitarian theology evangelicals are left with just me and Jesus and God; a unitarianism of the second person and an individualistic anthropology that construes the gospel in contractual terms. ([Location 6334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6334))

- in On the Incarnation of the Word, Athanasius of Alexandria contended that the salvation of the world was due to Christ the Word who became incarnate to restore the image of God in which humanity was made and from which all have fallen. ([Location 6353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6353))
- He shares this deficiency with other evangelicals for whom exclusive attention is given to the cross without considering the saving effects of the entire course of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection. ([Location 6364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6364))
- Campbell argues that the focus on the cross alone in evangelical theology fails to be sufficiently biblical. ([Location 6366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6366))
- The justification by faith perspective on Christ’s work, while placing a satisfactory emphasis on the cross, evacuates his incarnation, much of his life, his resurrection, and his ascension, of all soteriological value. According to the justification by faith model, these aspects of Christ have no real part to play in the great drama by which God saves humanity, since the justification by faith account of that drama focuses solely on the cross. Indeed, the justification by faith model struggles to justify the inclusion of these other aspects of Christ’s life and ministry within a full account of salvation at all!520 ([Location 6367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6367))

- Campbell further contends that any theology that seeks to do justice to Paul’s gospel “understands Christ’s atoning work as transformational, and . . . consequently encompasses his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and glorification.” ([Location 6373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6373))

- Some readers may think Campbell has introduced a new criticism, but in fact he is repeating an argument that is quite old. Luther’s Wittenberg colleague, Andreas Karlstadt, diverged from the teaching of the justification of sinners by grace through faith. ([Location 6378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6378))
- He believed that God’s grace would remake sinners and lead to a life of discipleship and obedience in which sin would be overcome. For Karlstadt sin was conquered through the “yieldedness” (Gelassenheit) of the Christian’s will to God’s will. This notion of Gelassenheit became central in Anabaptist theology and spirituality as believers were called to yield inwardly to the promptings of the Spirit of God and outwardly to the discipline of the community and the hostility of the world. ([Location 6380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6380))
- Evangelicalism has so objectified the atoning work of Christ in the cross and so abstracted Christ’s redeeming work from all human participation that Christians have been reduced to the role of mere spectators.

- Why are evangelicals so puzzled by Douglas Campbell’s analysis of Paul’s gospel in The Deliverance of God? In sum, the root of the problem is theological, not grammatical. ([Location 6395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6395))
- there any hope for evangelicals to understand Campbell? Yes, but only if they take two important steps: (1) evangelicals ([Location 6396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6396))
- evangelicals must begin to ask what it might mean to read the Scriptures (not just the writings of Paul) as the unfolding narrative of the triune God, and (2) they must begin to take seriously the whole course of Christ’s life as the enactment of the story of the salvation of the world. Then, and only then, will they be in a position to begin to imagine what Douglas Campbell is saying. Otherwise the faith of Jesus Christ will remain an evangelical conundrum. ([Location 6397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6397))

- I think that a powerful and rather sinister political and cultural dynamic can also be at work reinforcing the ongoing occupation of the evangelical imagination by the Justification discourse ([Location 6402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6402))
- This discourse fits like a hand in a glove with modern liberal pretensions, and allows its privatized and individualized Christian subjects to participate in the modern world essentially without hindrance from the teachings and example of Jesus, etc. In my local context, for example, in North Carolina in the USA, many Christians can consequently live largely undisturbed by some of the most challenging and costly aspects of the gospel; they can live and act, that is, primarily as Americans, whether that means more specifically as Democrats, Republicans, or some other essentially godless variation. And the overall result of this, as Barth saw long ago, is a tragic cultural compromise. Evil is excused and the witness of the church is caught up in hypocrisies evident even to pagan outsiders (Rom 2:24). All of which is to say that the stakes are quite real and rather high when assessing this theological model—which is really no theology at all (Gal 1:6b–7a). We may not hold out much hope for the displacement of this sinister model by either my work or the work of others, but we should certainly pray for it—a suitable note perhaps on which to end all my responses.

- The concern of this paper is to indicate certain basic features of Scottish theology (particularly of seventeenth-century theology), which have greatly molded our worship habits as well as the content of our preaching. ([Location 6478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6478))
- The seventeenth century marks the rise of so-called Federal Theology, which was to become the criterion of orthodoxy for the next two hundred years. ([Location 6480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6480))
- In a number of significant ways it constituted a movement away from the older Scottish tradition of Knox, the Scots Confession, the pre-Westminster confessions as well as from the theology of Calvin himself. Indeed Scottish worship has been influenced by the intermingling of these two traditions the older Scottish, more Catholic tradition, and the more rationalistic federal scheme of the seventeenth century. ([Location 6481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6481))
- The Westminster documents, which are the first reformed documents to enshrine officially the federal scheme in a mild way, themselves bear witness to this intermingling. ([Location 6484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6484))
- Federal Theology is that form of theology that gave central place to the concept of covenant and that distinguished different covenants in God’s relation to the world. ([Location 6485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6485))
- On the one hand, it was recognized that the concept of covenant was a central one in both the Old and New Testaments. On the other hand, the word was also a significant one in Scottish and English sociopolitical thought, not least in the upheavals of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. ([Location 6486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6486))
- The Westminster Assembly met at a time when the whole nation was caught up in a struggle for freedom. The attempt of Charles I to impose uniformity of worship by the introduction of Laud’s Liturgy in 1637 brought the response of the National Covenant in 1638. This was followed by the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 with its counter-attempt to impose uniformity of presbyterian government and worship in Scotland, England, and Ireland. The same year marked the opening of the Westminster Assembly as a parliamentary commission to achieve these ends. ([Location 6490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6490))
- The background of much theological controversy was the emerging sociopolitical philosophy of “social contract,” “contract of government,” “the rights of man,” “natural law”—illuminated by the “light of reason” and given divine sanction by “revelation.” ([Location 6498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6498))
- This, as Perry Miller3 has shown, was the philosophy of the many puritans who left these shores to get away from the “tyranny” of British kings and feudal overlords for the “free world” where they would be free to worship God as they pleased and with whom they pleased and where no one would “tell” them. ([Location 6500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6500))
- It provided a conceptual framework within which Reformed theology was to be recast (federal theology), but also provided a language of communication (virtually a “theology of politics”) that could be readily grasped by the man in the street, in a land struggling for freedom. ([Location 6505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6505))
- What do we mean by a covenant? Theologically speaking a covenant is a promise binding two people or two parties to love one another unconditionally. So the word was used of marriage in the English service book of 1549 and retained subsequently in the traditional forms of marriage service. ([Location 6511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6511))
- It is precisely this that makes a covenant so different from a contract. A contract is a legal relationship in which two people or two parties bind themselves together on mutual conditions to effect some future result. It betokens a mutual bargain, a compact, a business deal, grounded on certain terms or conditions with some future state of affairs in mind. It takes the form, “If . . . if . . . then . . . ,” as in the business world, etc. ([Location 6515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6515))
- we might summarize three things about the divine diatheke—which led the Reformers themselves to make use of the concept of covenant. ([Location 6532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6532))
- (a) It is a covenant of grace. It is not conditioned by anything in man, but is founded solely on the love of God. God has made a covenant for us in Christ (kaine diatheke)—nineteen ([Location 6533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6533))
- (b) Nevertheless God’s covenant of grace demands a response from men—a response of faith and gratitude and love. ([Location 6539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6539))
- (ii) A unilateral covenant (diatheke) is quite different. God has made a covenant for us in Christ—the New Covenant “in my blood.” But it still demands a response. ([Location 6544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6544))
- Two things must be held together on this understanding of grace in worship, (i) It is unconditioned—by any considerations of worth in man, i.e., it is free, (ii) It is unconditional in the claims it makes upon us, i.e., it is costly. No doubt Lutheranism stressed free grace, and puritan Calvinism stressed the costly claims of grace. But something goes wrong if we stress one at the expense of the other. ([Location 6549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6549))
- If, as Bonhoeffer has urged, Lutheranism can sometimes turn free grace into cheap grace, Puritan Calvinism can sometimes turn costly grace into conditional grace. ([Location 6553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6553))

- There is something in the human heart that makes men want to bargain with God. We see it in the story of the early medieval church, and also in the development of theology in seventeenth-century Scotland. As so often, the issue emerges most clearly when the church is most concerned about godly discipline and the relation between forgiveness and repentance. This was the focal point of the Reformation and was to become a burning issue in Scotland. ([Location 6567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6567))
- the natural thing seemed to be to say, that if the church was satisfied that he was truly repentant—if he was truly contrite, and confessed his sins and made due amends (contritio, confessio, satisfactio) then he could be forgiven and restored. ([Location 6576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6576))
- But as Calvin argued in the Institutes Book 3, the basic fallacy here was to invert the evangelical order of grace and make repentance prior to forgiveness, whereas in the New Testament forgiveness is logically prior to repentance. ([Location 6578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6578))
- It was precisely with this issue in mind that some of the seventeenth-century divines made a distinction between: (a) legal repentance—where the form is “If you repent, you will be forgiven” . . . “This do and thou shalt live!” and (b) evangelical repentance—where the form is “Christ has done this for you, therefore repent!” ([Location 6580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6580))
- During the seventeenth century, a change began to take place in Scottish preaching where a subtle kind of legalism began to creep in. The Scottish preacher preached the law in such a way that his concern was to produce a conviction of sin and a fear of judgment, so that he could call upon the sinner to repent and renounce his sin so that he might receive the word of forgiveness and hear the comforts of the gospel. ([Location 6585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6585))
- This pattern became so widespread that many divines felt that it was producing a doctrine of conditional grace that was foreign to the gospel. ([Location 6588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6588))
- In the course of his parish ministry he came across a copy of a book entitled The Marrow of Modern Divinity by a certain Edward Fisher, written in England in 1645. It was a book which re-affirmed the teaching of the Reformation about grace—in the manner of Luther’s Galatians—and it was destined to exert a profound influence on Boston and many others. ([Location 6602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6602))
- The central theme of the book was the distinction between legal repentance and evangelical repentance, arguing as Calvin had done, that forgiveness leads to true repentance. When you preach legal repentance, you are in fact appealing to the false motives of fear of hell and hope of heaven, and by a doctrine of conditional forgiveness destroying the grounds of Christian assurance, engendering the question, “Have I fulfilled the conditions . . . ?” ([Location 6605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6605))
- When, however, you preach evangelical repentance you preach Christ and his cross and appeal to the motives of gratitude and joy, and the believer finds assurance of forgiveness in Christ. ([Location 6608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6608))
- The central issue of the whole controversy was whether repentance and faith and holiness are conditions of the covenant of grace. This the Marrow men denied and the General Assembly affirmed. ([Location 6617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6617))
- The theological lesson that we learn from this whole period is that whenever a doctrine of conditional grace is taught, and the emphasis in worship and preaching begins to fall heavily on what we have to do—on our faith, our repentance, our need for humility and obedience—then the gospel of the grace of God, the joyful news of what God has done for us in Christ, begins to be pushed into the background, if not to disappear, and worship can become “a yoke grievous to be borne.” ([Location 6625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6625))
- Features of Federal Theology ([Location 6637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6637))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Federal theology, as indicated above, is that kind of theology that developed in the seventeenth century (in England and Holland as well as Scotland) and which distinguished different kinds of covenant, and made out of these a framework within which all theology is cast. ([Location 6637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6637))
- it was far more influenced by certain sociopolitical concepts of covenant than it probably ever realized. In particular it made a hard and fast distinction between the so-called covenant of works and the covenant of grace. ([Location 6639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6639))
- According to this scheme, God made Adam the child of nature, who could discern the laws of nature by the light of reason. On the basis of this, he entered into a covenant with him (the so-called covenant of works—or should we call it a “contract” between a sovereign and his subjects?) that if he obeyed the laws of nature (which are the laws of God) and fulfilled the conditions of the covenant, he would find eternal life. This is the foedus naturae—the contract of nature upon which all society is based. ([Location 6641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6641))
- But God in his sovereign grace does not destroy the human race, but elects out of the mass of fallen mankind a number for himself and makes a covenant of grace for them in Christ. This covenant of grace is already promised in the protevangelium of Genesis, announced by Abraham, reaffirmed at Sinai, and fulfilled in Christ. God by his Holy Spirit effectually calls the elect by his Spirit and brings them to saving faith by the instrumentality of Word and sacrament, the signs and seal of the covenant of grace. ([Location 6646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6646))
- This distinction between a covenant of works and a covenant of grace was unknown to Calvin and the Reformers—nor indeed would Calvin ever have taught it. ([Location 6649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6649))
- The very distinction implies the confusion between a covenant and a contract—the one Latin word foedus meaning both and hence obscuring the distinction. ([Location 6650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6650))
- For Calvin, all God’s dealings with men are those of grace, both in creation and in redemption. They flow from the loving heart of the Father. The two poles of his thought are grace and glory—from grace to glory. ([Location 6653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6653))
- There has been only one eternal covenant of grace, promised in the Old Testament and fulfilled in Christ. “Old” and “New” do not mean two covenants but two forms of the one eternal covenant—the central theme of Book Two of the Institutes. ([Location 6654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6654))
- The first person in Scotland, so far as I know, to speak of a “covenant of works” was Robert Rollock, the first Principal of Edinburgh University, in 1596 in Some Questions about the Covenant of God and in 1597 in his Treatise on Effectual Calling where he speaks of “God’s two covenants, both that of works and that of grace.” ([Location 6659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6659))
- The distinction had already been used in the immediately preceding years in England by Dudley Fenner, Perkins, and other puritans. From this time this distinction comes to be accepted and there emerges the federal scheme, which for 250 years was to become the standard of orthodoxy in Scotland. ([Location 6662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6662))

- Boston rightly argued that in the New Testament there is only the one covenant of grace made for us in Christ. This was clearly a return to Calvin and an attempt to interpret faith in non-contractual terms as “union with Christ.” ([Location 6679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6679))
- His weakness was that he still clung to the doctrine of a covenant of works, with its consequent restriction of the covenant of grace to the elect, although he struggled to do justice to the New Testament warrant that grace should be offered to all. ([Location 6680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6680))
- Similar advocates of federal theology had been emerging elsewhere, for example, Cocceius in Holland, John Preston, William Ames, John Ball in England, and in New England some eight works on federal theology appeared before 1650. ([Location 6687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6687))
- In the sociopolitical context of a nation struggling for freedom, this was a language that people understood, as possibly people today would understand the language of trade unions, civil rights, settlement of wage disputes, etc. ([Location 6690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6690))
- It was a kind of “theology of politics” that provided a conceptual framework for communication of the gospel to the man in the pew, and by means of such terminology the gospel grasped the imagination of a covenanted nation. ([Location 6692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6692))
- But, as so often in the attempt to effect a synthesis between Christianity and culture in the interests of communication, the gospel itself was to suffer certain modifications in this framework, and contractual notions were to be introduced that were radically to change the preaching and worship habits of the Scottish church. ([Location 6697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6697))
- With the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots, the question was raised and discussed—as by George Buchanan in his De jure regni apud Scotos (On the Rights of the Crown in Scotland)—as to the rights of a sovereign vis-à-vis the rights of the people, and how both could be safeguarded. ([Location 6700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6700))
- The concepts of “social contract” and “contract of government” were already emerging under the influence of medieval notions of natural law, and to receive later extensive development in the writings of John Locke, Rousseau, and others, and to exert a profound influence in New England. ([Location 6702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6702))
- Theologians begin to speak about the “sovereignty of God,” “the crown rights of the Redeemer,” “the covenant of nature,” “the rights of man,” “closing with Christ,” “contracting in marriage”. ([Location 6704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6704))
- the notion of “covenant” was a coordinating hermeneutical principle. We see this particularly in Cocceius. The danger was that when an appeal was made to biblical authority, it was the Bible understood in terms of the federal scheme. ([Location 6708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6708))
- The federal emphasis on the eternal decrees of God places the real moment of salvation beyond history and sees history as the arena for the execution of the decrees in a way that can detract from the more dynamic notion of God as actively at work within history. ([Location 6715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6715))
- (1) First and foremost, the whole federal scheme is built upon the deep seated confusion between a covenant and a contract, a failure to recognize that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is a covenant-God and not a contract-god. ([Location 6727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6727))
- A covenant brings its promises, its obligation, and indeed its warnings. But the obligations of grace are not conditions of grace, and it is false in Christian theology to articulate moral obligation in contractual terms (however much it may be necessary to safeguard the covenant of marriage by legal contract). ([Location 6729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6729))
- This confusion between a covenant and a contract leads to the notion of conditional grace, which inverts the evangelical order of forgiveness and repentance, so that we hesitate in the name of Christ to proclaim absolution and free forgiveness of sins, or hesitate to believe that we are truly forgiven. ([Location 6736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6736))
- So the Scottish mind has too often been torn by the question of assurance, which was to become such a point of issue in the Marrow controversy and lead McLeod Campbell in his pastoral concern for his flock at Rhu to break with the whole federal scheme—for which he was deposed by the General Assembly.

- For preaching, this means that the emphasis falls less on the indicatives of grace and more on the imperatives of repentance, obedience, and faith. ([Location 6784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6784))
- Where this shift of emphasis occurs, then the sacraments become badges of our personal covenant, and the Lord’s Table becomes the feast of the converted, of the penitent. ([Location 6787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6787))
- With the emergence of this changed emphasis, the fencing of the tables and catechizing assume a different significance in the discipline of the church, as stressing the need for repentance and faith as conditions for coming to the table. ([Location 6788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6788))
- (5) The development of the federal scheme in Scotland and the historical situation in the seventeenth century produced an unhappy if not false distinction between the visible and invisible church, which lost sight of the passionate emphasis of the Scots Confession and the older Scottish tradition on the view that there is only one church, the body of Christ. ([Location 6790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6790))
- In the federal scheme, the invisible church comprises the elect, known only to God, whereas the visible church is the sphere of the penitent, who have made their “external covenant.” The notion of a “covenanted nation” also pointed to the need to distinguish the church as known to God and the church as visible in the nation. ([Location 6794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6794))
- with the fierce division between protesters and resolutioners in the covenanting period, and the Secessions of the eighteenth century, the visible church began to break up, with the loss of the sense of the one holy Catholic Church to which all the earlier divines (including the earlier federalists) held so firmly, and an increasing appeal was made to the distinction between the church visible and invisible. ([Location 6798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6798))

- In each of these five negative evaluations of the federal scheme, we can see an impoverishment and restriction of the concept of grace—a shift of emphasis from what God has so freely and unconditionally done for all men in Christ, to a more subjective interest in what we have to do—to our need for repentance, personal covenanting, obedience, subjective grounds for assurance, closing with Christ, signing the covenants, keeping the Sabbath, a preoccupation with election and the outward evidences of election. ([Location 6802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6802))
- We can also see how these changes in theological emphasis can all too readily alter the whole content of worship where worship can become less and less a joyful, grateful, believing response to the objective realities of Christ and the gospel, to a more inward-looking subjective preoccupation with penitence and personal assurance of election. ([Location 6808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6808))

- two other features lie behind this impoverishment, which can only be indicated in brief outline. ([Location 6815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6815))
- (1) The first is the revolt from any kind of required liturgical form in the interest of freedom in worship—with an emphasis on “free prayer” and the “freedom of the Spirit.” ([Location 6816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6816))
- with the rapid increase of puritan influence at a time of reaction against imposed Anglican forms of worship (following Laud’s Liturgy of 1637) and with the avowed concern to reach agreement with English puritans in the interest of imposing uniformity of worship under the Solemn League and Covenant, concession after concession was made, if not with Assembly sanction, certainly in general practice. ([Location 6828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6828))
- One by one the older Scottish practices were discontinued largely in concession to puritan pressures, both at the Westminster Assembly and afterwards. The Apostles’ Creed was dropped from the baptismal service, but formally appended at the end of the Catechisms; the Lord’s Prayer was gradually omitted from public worship (as another form of imposed prayer!) and was almost unused for public worship for two hundred years: daily services were largely discontinued; read prayers were replaced by “conceived” prayers; Holy Scripture was only read if accompanied by a lecture; and the taking up of the offering excluded from the actual service of worship.

- This was a far cry from Knox’s contention that within the covenant of grace there is a prescribed way of response in Scripture where the church must take the form of a servant.

- If there is one doctrine that more than any other characterized the theology of both Calvin and Knox, it was the doctrine of the sole priesthood of Christ within his church.

- The objective pole no doubt was acknowledged as an article of orthodox belief, but the real interest became the anthropocentric one—what we do!

- Whereas the New Testament rings with the note of assurance, and the imperatives of the gospel flow from the apostles’ understanding of the indicatives of the gospel, among his people he found little evidence of peace and joy and confidence in God. The more he thought about this, the more he became convinced it was due to a “legal strain” in their thinking that led to a want of true religion in the land. ([Location 6986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6986))
- In other words, deep in their thinking was a doctrine of conditional grace—“only if we do this, and don’t do that, can we come to the enjoyment of salvation.” ([Location 6994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=6994))
- That is, he made it his concern to summon them to look away from themselves—to the love of God, that they might know him as Father and discover there is forgiveness in God, and that God’s grace, which certainly lays costly unconditional claims upon us, is not conditioned by considerations of worth and merit. ([Location 7006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7006))
- Repentance, faith, and love, are not conditions of grace, but our response to grace, and the way to evoke that response is to hold out to men the love of the Father, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the promises of the Spirit—and this is the road to assurance. ([Location 7008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7008))
- The other thing that led to his people’s lack of assurance and joy was the high Calvinist doctrine of election, and a double decree—the doctrine that Christ did not die for all men, but only for some, the elect. Deep down, his people were tortured by the question, “Yes, Christ died upon the cross to bring forgiveness, but did he die for me? ([Location 7010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7010))
- Campbell saw that fundamental to the whole issue was the doctrine of God. Instead of thinking of God as the Father, who loves all men, and who in Christ gives us the gift of sonship, and who freely forgives us through Jesus Christ, they thought of God as one whose love is conditioned by human repentance and faith, and whose forgiveness had to be purchased by the payment of the sufferings of Christ on behalf of the elect. ([Location 7024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7024))
- Federal Calvinism developed at the end of the sixteenth and particularly in the seventeenth century in England and Scotland—as well as in Holland and New England. It is the form of theology that gave central place to the concept of covenant, and that distinguished different covenants in God’s relation to the world, and made out of them a framework within which all theology is cast. ([Location 7035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7035))
- In particular, it made a hard and fast distinction between the so-called covenant of works and the covenant of grace. ([Location 7037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7037))
- According to this scheme, God made Adam the child of nature, who could discern the laws of nature by the light of reason. On the basis of this, he entered into a covenant or contract with him (the so-called covenant of works) that if he obeyed the laws of nature (which are the laws of God) and fulfilled the conditions of the covenant, he would find eternal life. This is the foedus naturae—the contract of nature upon which all society is based. ([Location 7039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7039))
- The first person to use the phrase a “covenant of works” in Scotland was Robert Rollock, the first Principal of Edinburgh University, in a work published in 1596. It had already been used in England by the English Puritan, Dudley Fenner, about 1585, and by William Perkins in 1590. The Westminster Confession of Faith (with the Larger and Shorter Catechism) was the first reformed Confession to embody the federal scheme. ([Location 7050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7050))
- 1. The whole federal scheme is built upon the deep-seated confusion between covenant and a contract.24 Whereas a covenant (theologically speaking) is a promise in which two people or two parties bind themselves to love one another unconditionally (as in the marriage covenant), a contract is a legal relationship in which two parties bind themselves together on mutual conditions—as in business and political contracts. ([Location 7055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7055))
- 2. The federal scheme made a radical dichotomy between the sphere of nature and the scheme of grace, of natural law and gospel. All men by nature stand related to God, the contracting Sovereign, as to a Judge, under natural law and exposed to the sanctions of law. Only the elect are related to God by grace through Christ the Mediator. ([Location 7067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7067))
- The relationship between church and the world, church and state, is no longer understood christologically, as by Calvin and Knox, but in terms of gospel and natural law. ([Location 7070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7070))
- The consequence of this doctrine is twofold. ([Location 7074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7074))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- (a) The doctrine implies a loss of the notion of Christ’s headship over all creation as Mediator, his solidarity with all men as the Head of the race, as in the theology of the Ephesians and Colossians or as expounded by Irenaeus, Athanasius, and the Cappadocian divines, as well as by Calvin. ([Location 7075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7075))
- The emphasis in doctrine is no longer on the incarnation, on Christ’s solidarity with all men, but almost exclusively on Christ’s work on behalf of the elect, his passive obedience on the cross and satisfaction for the sins of believers, with whom he stands related, not in terms of incarnational oneness—but of foedus, contract. ([Location 7077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7077))
- As a consequence, the older doctrine, which interpreted faith in terms of “union with Christ the Head” and “participation” in Christ, is replaced by a more judicial interpretation of faith, as Thomas Boston also saw. ([Location 7079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7079))

- Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are seen, not so much as seals of the gospel (as evangelical ordinances or “converting ordinances,” as interpreted, for example, by John Davidson of Prestonpans in the older tradition, an interpretation rejected by George Gillespie)—but rather as seals of our faith, or seals of our repentance. ([Location 7091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7091))
- Where the shift of emphasis occurs, then sacraments become badges of our personal covenant and the Lord’s Table becomes a feast of the converted, of the penitent. ([Location 7094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7094))

- With the emergence of this changed emphasis, the fencing of the table and catechizing assume a different significance in the discipline of the church, as stressing the need for repentance and faith as conditions for coming to the Lord’s Table. ([Location 7095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7095))
- we can see an impoverishment and restriction of the concept of grace—a shift of emphasis from what God has so freely and unconditionally done for all men in Christ, to a more subjective interest in what we have to do—to our need for repentance, personal covenanting, obedience, subjective grounds for assurance—a preoccupation with election and the evidences of election.

- McLeod Campbell came to see that you can only offer the gospel to all men if indeed it is good news for all men—that Christ died for all.

- In the federal scheme, that order is inverted.

- the medieval world said that if the sinner is truly contrite, if he confesses his sins and makes due amends (contritio, confessio, satisfactio) then he may be forgiven and restored. This was the root of much of the medieval doctrine of merit. ([Location 7179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7179))
- Calvin argued that this inverted the evangelical order of grace, and made repentance prior to forgiveness, whereas in the New Testament forgiveness is logically prior to repentance. ([Location 7181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7181))
- Evangelical repentance, consequently takes the form “Christ has borne your sins on the cross, therefore repent!” That is, repentance, Calvin argues, is our response to grace, not a condition of grace. ([Location 7183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7183))
- What did Calvin and the Marrowmen mean by saying that “forgiveness is logically prior to repentance”? Let me use an illustration. Suppose I had the misfortune to have a quarrel with someone, and the result was that we became estranged from one another. ([Location 7194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7194))
- Then suppose after some time I came to my friend sincerely seeking reconciliation and said to him, “I forgive you!,” it would be clear that this would be not only a word of love, it would be a word of condemnation for I would be clearly implying that he was the guilty party! How would he react? His immediate reaction would probably be one of indignation, for, sensing the element of judgment in my words, he might reject my word of forgiveness by refusing to submit to the verdict of guilt implied in it. ([Location 7196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7196))
- The good news of the gospel is that there is forgiveness with God, and he has spoken his word of forgiveness in Christ on the cross—a word of love to mankind, and yet also a word of judgment. But that word summons from us a response of faith and penitence. ([Location 7202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7202))
- God’s forgiveness is logically prior to our repentance. It is the goodness of God that leads us to repentance. ([Location 7206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7206))
- 1. On the one hand, God has spoken this word of forgiveness (of love and judgment) to the world in Jesus Christ. So Jesus Christ lived a life of real oneness of mind with the Father, when in the course of his whole life on earth, he made the Father’s love and the Father’s holy condemnation of sin known to men. That in itself meant suffering, and in the sufferings of Jesus, we see the sufferings of the Father, in his dealings with men on behalf of the Father. ([Location 7210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7210))
- 2. But Jesus Christ does not merely represent God to men in bringing God’s word of forgiveness to men (dealing with men on behalf of the Father). He also represents men to God, and deals with the Father on behalf of men—as our great High Priest, our Intercessor. So as man, his whole life of sonship is a perfect response on our behalf to the Father, as the well-beloved Son in whom the Father is well pleased—a response that is at once one of perfect trust in the Father’s love and at the same time one of perfect submission on our behalf to the verdict of guilty (yet “without any personal consciousness of sin”). ([Location 7214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7214))
- Very movingly, McLeod Campbell interprets the once and for all vicarious humanity of Christ and the continuing vicarious humanity of Christ under the category of prayer, seeing the whole ministry of Jesus in dealing with the Father on behalf of men in these terms, presenting us to the Father as God’s dear children. ([Location 7228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7228))
- Does the vicarious response of Jesus Christ offered to the Father on our behalf then eliminate the need for a response on our part? Not at all. Conversely, it gives us a basis for a joyful response of praise and gratitude and trust and love—a basis for worship, where our response is the gift of participating by the Spirit in the Son’s self-offering on our behalf to the Father. When we realize that Christ bore our sins in his own body on the tree and submitted for us to the verdict of guilty, then we know we are unconditionally summoned to personal repentance and faith. ([Location 7230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7230))
- Participation is consequently a key word in McLeod Campbell’s theology. The Son of God has participated in our humanity, that through the Spirit we might participate in his Sonship and communion with the Father. ([Location 7235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7235))
- Participation is what we do—we pray, we repent, we believe, we worship—but only in the sense of participating in what Christ has done and is doing. In this way, faith and repentance and prayer are not conditions of grace, but the gift of the Spirit of sonship who so unites us with Christ in his communion with the Father that we might have a ground for rejoicing in God. ([Location 7236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7236))
- interpret the gospel in New Testament terms as good news for all in the gift of Jesus Christ to the world. One of his favorite tests is “God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; and he who has not the Son has not life” (1 John 5:11–12). ([Location 7241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7241))
- Thus, if following Calvin and Marrowmen, he interprets “evangelical repentance” to mean “forgiveness, therefore repentance” (and NOT “repentance, therefore forgiveness”), in terms of his doctrine of atonement he sees with Augustine and Calvin that the order is “forgiveness, therefore atonement” (and NOT “atonement, therefore forgiveness,” as in certain types of Western penal satisfaction theories). ([Location 7246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7246))
- In his own language, the filial is prior to the judicial, NOT the judicial prior to the filial. ([Location 7249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LP0XDJE&location=7249))
