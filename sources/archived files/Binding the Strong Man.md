- “It's hard to know when to respond to the seductiveness of the world and when to respond to its challenges,” wrote E. B. White. “I arise in the morning torn between the twin desires to change the world and to enjoy the world. That makes it hard to plan the day.” ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=636))

- How can we situate the Gospel within a concrete socio-historical setting when we have no fully reliable extrinsic testimony (evidence apart from Mark's own narrative) as to either its date or geographical provenance (origin)?

- A major (though no longer dominant) school of thought believes that Mark was written in Rome by a Jewish author for a predominantly gentile audience. Those who assume this provenance interpret the presence of Latinisms in the text as confirming evidence—Mark would naturally use local idiom in writing to a Roman audience. If I concurred with this, my task would be to situate the production of the Gospel within the socio-economic context of a major Hellenistic city; the political context of the imperial capital under Nero (54–68 C.E.), the year of the four emperors (68–69), or Vespasian (69– ([Location 2259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2259))

- In contrast, I hold that a date prior to 70 and during the revolt (thus after 66) is essential to the coherency of the political and economic ideology of Mark's narrative. Mark's vigorous criticism of the temple state and its political economy would obviously have been superfluous once the temple had been destroyed.

- Jesus and Mark lived within the same historical “era,” which can be marked off by significant alternations in the socio-political character of life in Palestine. This era began with the death of Herod the Great (4 B.C.E.). The division of his domain into three tetrarchies, and the subsequent transfer of Judea to direct Roman administration with the ouster of Archelaus (6 C.E.), were accompanied by major outbreaks of socio-political unrest by Jewish nationalists, which continued sporadically until the outbreak of the Jewish revolt (66 C.E.). The era closed with the defeat of the rebels and the destruction of the temple by the Roman general Titus in 70 C.E.

- specific historical personalities who appear in the Jesus story, such as the Roman procurator Pilate (in office 26–36 C.E.) or the native Jewish king Herod Antipas (ruled northern Palestine 4 B.C.E.–39 C.E.), had changed by the time of Mark. Events had also changed the general political atmosphere; what was sporadic, predominantly rural resistance to Roman colonialism in Palestine at the time of Jesus had coalesced into a major, Jerusalem-centered insurrection at the time Mark wrote. Nevertheless, the basic social structures and dynamics that characterized this era did not alter significantly.

- There is then a fundamental structural, if not exactly historical, symmetry between the world in which Mark sets his story of Jesus and his own world. This made it all the easier for Mark to insert into his story of Jesus issues that were pressing in Mark's time.

- Another one of our unconscious etic assumptions is our post-Enlightenment preoccupation with the individual: Instead of individualism, what we find in the first-century Mediterranean world is what might be called “dyadism.”…A dyadic personality…would conceive of himself as always interrelated to other persons while occupying a distinct social position both horizontally (with others sharing the same status, moving from center to periphery) and vertically (with others above and below in social rank) [Malina, 1981:55]. ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2389))
- At the same time, although Horsley is certainly correct that there was no organized military insurrection during the time of Jesus, there was one during the time of Mark, and so it is legitimate to assume that the evangelist's community took a stance vis-à-vis the revolt and its leaders, just as they did toward the other major social groups and practices (for further discussion of Horsley's theses, see Appendix, ([Location 2412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2412))
- Belo calls Palestine “sub-Asiatic” because the state (Roman and Herodian) did not directly control agricultural production through infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, but instead appropriated surplus in advance through tribute, and controlled the exchange of goods. ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2430))
- Co-existing in the Asiatic sphere were two systems known by economic anthropology as “reciprocity” and “redistribution.” Carney defines reciprocity as the clan-based system, which for Jews was rooted in tribal origins: ([Location 2432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2432))
- This “primitive” system, which characterized the tribal confederacy of Israel and is reflected in the law of Moses (Gottwald, 1979:293ff.), persisted in Palestinian village life in Mark's era. It determined that economic security and stability were bound up in the extended family household and kinship system. ([Location 2438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2438))
- Initially a priestly group mobilized its labour force…to labour on the temple lands. The temple acted as central storehouse. Produce was stockpiled within that storehouse, and redistributed to feed the temple's nonagricultural work force (generally weaving women and artisans) as well as the agriculturalists who produced it…. As intensive settled agriculture now became possible, the little temple-centered communities grew in size and complexity [ibid.:173]. This in turn gave rise to walled cities, royalty, and military classes. We see this development in Israel with the rise of the monarchy (see 1 Sm 8). Redistributive economies were controlled by the king or priestly aristocracy; they set “value equivalences,” protected trade routes, and regulated volume and personnel. Business was conducted by “emissaries of the palace-centered economies,” not entrepreneurs. As we can see in the construction of both the first and second temple in Israel, this system: Came to develop the logistical techniques for coordinating manpower, food, and material for huge building operations—always political because of their massive social implications. Among these techniques were the direction of labour…taxation, bureaucracy, and controls on transportation [ibid.:174]. Within this regulated economy, the rise of large landed estates, whose internal operation was also based on the redistributive system, had to be controlled.

- Rome often awarded land taken by conquest to native dynasties, and landownership was increasingly concentrated in the hands of royal estates during and after the reign of Herod the Great (37 B.C.E.–4 C.E.). In Galilee there is strong evidence of persistent family-based small holdings, but land alienation and resultant tenancy was ubiquitous among the poor.

- Military culture and technology made a particular impact, especially because of the large influx of veterans into Palestine, whose pay or pension was often in land grants in colonial territories. ([Location 2470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2470))

- Aside from the peasant majority, there was a very small independent artisan and bureaucratic class, and a tiny aristocracy, which of an estimated population of seven hundred fifty thousand in Palestine made up less than one-half of one percent. The local ruling class after Herod was increasingly urban-based, and tended to accommodate the colonial forces culturally and economically. The rural peasantry on the other hand experienced hellenization as further economic marginalization and cultural isolation, especially in Galilee, as Freyne has shown (1980). The main socio-economic conflict was the… ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2489))
- There is considerable evidence, including the parables of Jesus of Nazareth, that by the time of Herod there had arisen many large landed estates. Simultaneous with the growth of these large estates there was a steady increase in population. Some peasant holdings were subdivided, but more often the younger brothers were left landless because of the inheritance laws. Moreover, large numbers of other peasants who had fallen into debt were forced into the ranks of the rural proletariat. Most of these became marginal day-laborers. Herod, and to a degree, his successors employed many of these in elaborate building projects. That these laborers, permanently uprooted from the land, formed a potential source of instability was a fact not lost… ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2496))

- let us look at the portrait of peasant existence offered by Carney. Its “basic hallmarks” were “political powerlessness and straitened economic circumstances” (1975:198). Peasant families had three obligations for production. Above all they had to grow enough food to feed themselves and their animals, and to have seed for the following year's crop. Then there was the need for a surplus because of the demands of both the reciprocity and redistributive systems. At the village level, a little extra was needed: To obtain the occasional iron implement or utensil, to contribute to the local festivals, and to make a loan to a neighbor in need. Only by… ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2505))
- A Galilean tenant farmer could have up to half his harvest extracted as rent. Small holders were subject to the land tax or tribute of Herodian kings or the annona of the Romans, either of which ranged from one-quarter to one-third of a harvest. Not included in this were the tithes to Jewish authorities, an obligation that (unlike the Sabbath) received no recognition from Rome. According to S. Oppenheimer (1977:23ff.) the tithing structure stipulated in rabbinic tradition was: 1. a tenth of the harvest as terumah for the priests; 2. a tenth of the remainder as a first tithe to the Levites; 3. a tenth of… ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2512))
- Hence, too, the peasant idea of the “limited good.” This holds that all good things—food, land, honour, standing—are in fixed quantities and short supply. As their quantities cannot be increased, if one peasant gains a greater share of any one of them than heretofore, he is deemed to have done so at the cost of all his fellows. This notion is the cause of unending, unrelenting disingenuousness, struggle, and suspicion in peasant communities…. If an unusually large surplus is somehow produced, it is spent upon a festival, to propitiate the group ([Location 2523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2523))
- The Galilean Jewish peasant found himself in the rather strange position that those very people to whom he felt bound by ties of national and religious loyalty, the priestly aristocracy, were in fact his social oppressors ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2533))
- Those with disposable income were the elites, masters of the great estates with their household economies. So it is that the cities, where the elites reside and consume conspicuously, are economically parasitic upon the countryside in antiquity. For the cities consume, relatively, far more in luxury goods, taxes, and impressed labor than their craftsmen produce in artifacts…. There was, then, a marked cultural gulf, not just a lag, between town and country…. Different sectors of the populations of such societies each hold completely different, and mutually unintelligible, pictures of their “world” and life space…. The thought world and the social world of the military-bureaucratic elite and the subelite of large landowners with which the former was linked were quite different from and manifestly superior to, those of the peasant ([Location 2540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2540))
- This tension was especially acute in Galilee, where the “breadbasket” of the plains was literally surrounded by newer Hellenistic cities ([Location 2546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2546))
- Whether Ptolemais on the coast, or Herodian-established Sepphoris in the interior and Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, these cities were dependent upon the rural food supply in Galilee, and therefore determined to maintain geopolitical control. ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2547))
- As urban encroachment continued, the formal dividing line between city and village grew diffuse, forcing many to exchange clan identity for citizenship in the Hellenistic polis. The resentment among peasants as they watched the slow erosion of the social fabric of their agrarian way of life is reflected in Mark ([Location 2551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2551))
- If for no other reasons than its geographical isolation and distance from Jerusalem and its greater level of intercourse with the gentile world, Galilee was regarded with general suspicion by the Jerusalem hierarchy ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2554))
- In sum, Galilee was doubly peripheral. It was increasingly controlled by the political and economic forces of Hellenistic urban penetration. Symbolically and socio-economically it was controlled by Jerusalem in the south. This makes it all the more remarkable that rural and village Galilee is placed at the narrative and ideological center of Mark's story, in explicit tension with both Jerusalem and the Hellenistic cities. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2559))
- After almost a century of independence under the Hasmonean dynasty following the Maccabean revolt from Hellenistic rule in 167–142 B.C.E. Jewish Palestine became subject again in 63 B.C.E. to the ascendant empire of Rome. At that time, after a brief struggle, Emperor Pompey established Hyrcanus II as a native client king and instituted the tribute. The Parthian empire overtook Palestine briefly in 40 B.C.E., but Rome reestablished control in 37 B.C.E. and then began the long and brutal reign of another client king, Herod the Great. ([Location 2577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2577))
- Israel served as a buffer state between the Romans and the Parthian Empire to the east. The Parthian Empire was the only remaining formidable threat to the extensive dominance of the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean world…. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2584))
- Herod's kingdom was divided into three native tetrarchies. Two of these survived until the brief reign of Agrippa I, under whom Palestine was again united from 41–44 C.E. The third tetrarchy (Judea, Samaria, and Idumea) came under Roman administration following the ouster of Archelaus during popular revolt in 6 C.E. After 44 C.E. all of Palestine came under direct Roman rule. ([Location 2589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2589))
- Mark also mentions Pilate, an Italian procurator of the equestrian order. As a general rule Roman administrators were less concerned with imposing Hellenistic values than with the tricky politics of colonial rule. Rome was relatively tolerant of the fierce exclusivism of the Jews; as long as the ultimate hegemony of Rome was recognized and the tribute paid, a modicum of local autonomy could continue. Rome remained, however, in firm control. The procurator had the power to appoint and depose the high priest, the symbolic leader of the Jewish polity, at will. He retained stewardship over the high priestly garments, thus effectively controlling its functioning. ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2604))
- Through the ever-present legions, barracked adjacent to the temple in Jerusalem, the imperial state could—and did—brutally crush any signs of insurrection. ([Location 2610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2610))
- After Herod's death in 4 B.C.E. while the three sons were in Rome, the arsenal of Sepphoris was looted by Judas, son of the guerilla leader Ezekias who had been executed by Herod the Great…. The legate of Syria…marched south with auxiliaries from Beirut and Aretas IV retook and burned Sepphoris, and enslaved its people…. Antipas quickly rebuilt it and made it his capital until the founding of Tiberias; the tektones (carpenters and masons) of Nazareth must often have commuted [the four miles] there ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2612))
- The second example, a series of violent clashes under the procurator Cumanus (48–52), dramatizes the cycle of revenge (Josephus, Ant., XX, v,3–4). During the Passover feast in Jerusalem, provocation by a Roman soldier caused a riot of Jewish pilgrims. The restoration of order resulted in several Jewish deaths. Shortly afterward Jewish urban terrorists responded by murdering an imperial official traveling to the city. Cumanus's forces in turn pillaged several nearby villages and punished local officials. During these raids, a soldier desecrated a copy of Torah from a local synagogue, again infuriating the Jews and setting off a new round of protests. For failing to control these and other disturbances, Cumanus was eventually banished by Rome; Rhoads considers his tenure the turning point in colonial tensions (1976:70ff.). ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2618))
- No symbolic action was more consequential, however, than the cessation of sacrifices to the emperor in the Jerusalem temple in June of 66 C.E. This was tantamount to a declaration of insurrection, and it is this war that I will argue serves as the immediate historical context for the writing of Mark's Gospel. ([Location 2631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2631))
- One form of popular resistance of particular importance to Mark's era is “social banditry”: [It] arises in traditional agrarian societies where peasants are exploited by landowners and governments, especially in situations where many peasants are economically vulnerable and administration is inefficient. Times of economic crisis and social disruption (such as war) may produce banditry on an increasingly widespread scale…. Bandits usually enjoy the support of local peasants; far from aiding authorities in capturing the bandits, the people may actually protect them. Bandits share, and often symbolize, the peasant's basic sense of justice and religious loyalties…and at times social banditry accompanies or leads into peasant revolts [Horsley, 1981:412]. ([Location 2648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2648))
- On the eve of the revolt: Josephus claims that now “the majority of people” (hoi polloi) practiced banditry, and that whole towns were ruined…. The banditry evidently took its toll on the gentry, for many wealthy Jews left their estates in search of safer surroundings among the Gentiles. With little to lose from increasing disorder, a sizable portion of the population had become outlaws…. Large groups of brigands already held sway as a dominant force in Galilee when Josephus arrived to take charge of organizing the defenses in 66–67 [ibid.:69]. ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2660))
- It is of utmost significance that the term used by Josephus as a technical reference to social bandits (Greek lēstēs) appears in Mark twice. In both cases the narrative context is one of implied subversive activity (14:48; 15:27; see below, 13,A,i). ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2670))
- In all cases mentioned by Josephus, the Sicarii were highly discriminate and always directed their attacks against fellow Jews, not against Roman soldiers or officials. They employed three tactics in particular: (a) selective, symbolic assassinations; (b) more general assassinations along with plundering of the property of the wealthy and powerful; and (c) kidnapping for ransom [ibid.:205]. ([Location 2675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2675))
- This strategy served to break down the social security and solidarity of the ruling classes, and was no doubt partly responsible for their increasing defection to the Romans just before and during the war. As we shall see (below, 12,F,ii), Mark appears to portray Barabbas as a sicarius terrorist (15:7). ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2678))

- This protest went on for forty days, but the action that elicited the greatest concern among Roman authorities was the simultaneous agricultural strike in the countryside by (Galilean?) peasants, who refused to sow the next year's crops. The Romans were well aware that not only would this endanger the food supply in coastal cities, but also would intensify the economic pressure posed by the tribute obligations, and hence cause an even greater number of peasants to turn to brigandage. Petronius finally agreed to petition Gaius to change his mind, though in the end it was only the emperor's death that resolved the crisis. John Yoder probably goes too far in describing this incident as “a concerted act of resistance which this time had all the marks of a Gandhian campaign” (1972:92), but it does indicate the presence and vitality of nonviolent kinds of popular protest during the era.

- a third form of popular dissent, which is equally crucial to understanding Mark. These were movements whose primary expressions were prophetic and eschatological. The main literary groups (Pharisees, priestly class, Essenes) tended to focus upon canonical biblical prophecy. In contrast: There emerged during the first century C.E. among the Jewish common people several prophets of two distinctive types. The individual prophets of the oracular type appear to be a continuation of the classical biblical oracular ([Location 2699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2699))

- The “action” prophets, or what P. Barnett calls “Sign Prophets” (1981), were leaders who performed or promised symbolic acts that heralded liberation. Josephus mentions three important examples. During Pilate's tenure, a Samaritan prophet led an armed group up to Mount Gerizim, the traditional Samaritan site of eschatological restoration; there he promised to unveil “holy vessels” buried by Moses (Horsley and Hanson, 1985:162f.). This action was a symbolic articulation of Samaritan secession from the Jerusalem temple-based order, into which Samaria had been unwillingly incorporated since the… ([Location 2708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2708))

- Two decades later, under the procurator Fadus, a prophet named Theudas (mentioned in Acts 5:36) began a movement, promising to part the waters of the Jordan. Though unarmed, this movement was also dealt with militarily by Roman forces (ibid.:164f.). Theudas's prophetic symbolism was, like that of Mark's Jesus as we shall see, multireferential. On the one hand his promise recalled the action of Elijah in the context of building a subversive prophetic movement (2 Kgs 2:6–8); on the other it alluded to a new exodus from slavery, in the expectation that enemy troops would again be swallowed by the parted waters… ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2713))

- A third example took place under the procurator Felix, probably around 56 C.E., for it is also mentioned by Luke (Acts 21:38). A Jewish prophet identified with Egypt built up a large following of the rural masses in the wilderness, preparing to lead an (unarmed) assault upon Jerusalem, and promising that from the Mount of Olives he would command the walls of the city to crumble (ibid.:167f.). There can be no doubt about the subversive nature of these allusions, on the one hand to the Jericho military tradition of Joshua (Jos 6:15ff.), and on the other to the apocalyptic tradition of Zechariah, in which Yahweh would fight against the pagan nations from the Mount of Olives (… ([Location 2719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2719))

- From these examples we can see a “clear pattern of symbolic correspondence between the great historical acts of redemption and the new, eschatological acts anticipated by these prophetic movements” (ibid.:171).

Mark will do the same, invoking the tradition of the wilderness and other… ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2725))

- Turning to the “oracular” prophets, the most obvious example is John the Baptist, who figures decisively in Mark's narrative. John appears to have taken after Elijah, who withdrew to the wilderness to gain “both personal strength and a prophetic commission to return to his people as the agent of revolution against an oppressive regime (1 Kgs 19)” (ibid.:140). At the same time, he also followed in the tradition of the classic oracular prophets such as Amos and… ([Location 2729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2729))

- This does not mean that messianic discourse was not intelligible in the mid-first century; only that there was no one dominant concept to which Mark could appeal. Instead, there was an ongoing struggle over royal ideology within Judaism, and this is reflected in Mark's cautious and polemical appropriation of the designation “Messiah” (below, 8,C). The same applies to the rubric “Son of David,” which Christian interpreters have assumed was an accepted messianic title based upon genealogy. On the contrary: [It]simply does not occur with any frequency in Jewish literature until after the fall of Jerusalem…. In contrast to the care and concern about legitimate descent and genealogy of the priestly and especially high priestly families in Jewish society at this time, it may be seriously doubted that there existed any families whose descent from the house of David could be confirmed. The point is that the imagery of a Davidic king symbolized substantively what this agent of God would do: liberate and restore the fortunes of Israel, as had the original David (ibid.:91).

- Conflict over messianic ideology had to do with what kind of kingship was being proposed. In the biblical tradition itself there was a tension between the popular, provisional, and covenantal kingship model of the early Israelite tribal confederacy, and the dynastic, centralized, and hegemonic royal ideology of Davidism (see 1 Sm 8). Prophetic criticism of Israelite royalty continually raised the political question of legitimacy, arguing that the king's authority was based not upon a dynastic guarantee ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2764))

- Davidic/Messianic “restoration” thus meant different things to different classes. At the time of the Maccabean restoration of an Israelite monarchy, for example, “the fact that the Hasmonean high priests aggrandized their position by assuming the title of king provoked among their enemies, especially among the Pharisees and the Essenes, a revived expectation of the restoration of the true royal line, the House of David” (R.

- In Mark's time the discourse of popular kingship from the perspective of the Roman colonizers obviously functioned subversively. The priestly aristocracy, if they were interested in it at all, saw native kingship in terms of the widening of their institutional power and privilege. To some of the leaders of the revolt, restored kingship may have articulated a vision of independence, perhaps even expansive regional hegemony, as under the Maccabees. But to the peasant masses it would have been the symbol for the establishing of justice and equality in Israel. It is this latter perspective that is adopted by Mark, who identifies the messianic vocation not with ruling class dynastic-royal ideology, but rather with apocalyptic resistance ideology and prophetic solidarity with the poor. Mark's Messianism thus repudiates the “son of David” designation in favor of Daniel's “Human One” (below, 8,C,ii, D,ii).

Once they had fled, it was impossible for them to return to their villages and towns, which had either been destroyed or were now in the hands of their wealthy enemies who had deserted to the Romans….

- Unlike the Israelite notion of debt, however, which was rooted in the practice of reciprocity and gift-exchange (below, iii), our modern debt code is based upon an ideology of social contract and a political economy of market-exchange. Thus we instinctively think of debt in economic terms. Whereas in ancient Palestine social power was exclusively determined by kinship and class, today it is usually based upon material accumulation. Thus the “captains of industry” gain prestige according to ability to control markets and labor, rather than traditional assets such as physical strength, family line, or even education (though all these things can help). Yet in fact debt does include notions of legal obligation and moral duty in our social world. There are the imperatives of “citizenship,” expressed as what we “owe to the country,” such as military or civic service, and in the name of social contract, we cede social or political power to qualified “authorities.” ([Location 2932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=2932))

- Notions of “clean and unclean” (or order and chaos) in the material world also apply to the body politic, functioning to establish and maintain group boundaries and communal identity. Our “advanced” social mores still tend to prefer segregation of the physically and mentally disabled. Expected modes of dress and behavior in certain places, which we call “etiquette,” in fact function to enforce a bourgeois purity code of class separation. Today group boundaries are no less efficacious for being implicit. A white matron who roams freely on the wide avenues of the suburbs would walk furtively and anxiously on the sidewalks of a black urban ghetto—if she ventured there at all. Indeed, de facto racial segregation is the norm in most parts of the U.S.A. today despite the absence of state sanction. And, as in ancient Israel, modern purity codes function politically as well as socially. The very same myths of “chosenness” that shape patriotic ideologies in the U.S.A. also shape the dreams of neo-Nazi white supremacists and the social codes of Afrikaaner apartheid. And what about the socio-symbolic apparatus of our national security state, with its “priesthood” of the security-cleared and its “holy places” surrounded by barbed wire?

- The two main institutional “vehicles” in which the symbolic order was objectified and in which its authority was invested were the law (Torah) and the temple, which represented, respectively, the covenant and presence of Israel's God. As the primary redemptive media, they defined (in the case of law) and controlled (in the case of temple, through propitiatory sacrifice and other symbolic actions) debt and impurity in the body politic. S. Isenberg (1973) has shown how the various factions among the elite in Roman Palestine competed for influence and control over the symbolic order in order to increase their social and political standing. Other groups simply struggled for access to the redemptive media, or disputed the authority of the elite over them. Occasionally a group would challenge the system as a whole as well as its stewards; Mark is a case in point. Even Mark, however, is selective; he rejects the temple as an institution, but not the Torah, instead challenging the elite in their interpretations of the sacred texts.

- The Pharisees were certainly committed to making piety possible for the masses as the above example indicates, and in that sense promoted greater access to the redemptive media.

And in their alternative program, the Pharisees preserved not only their privilege but their indispensability as adjudicants of the system. Their actual social solidarity with the poor was minimal, as reflected in their own observance of strict purity regulations for table fellowship. It is this reproduction of the elitist system under the guise of popular piety that Mark objects to in his negative portrayal of the Pharisees in the Gospel.

All three responses, however, have one crucial thing in common: the purity code itself is upheld as central.

- The debt system was the realm of the priestly class, not only because of their role in the sacrificial cult, but perhaps more importantly because of their oversight in the collecting of tithes. I have already mentioned (above, B,ii) the economic burden of the tithe structure fell upon the food producers, and this was cause for resentment among the peasantry. They could see that many of the clergy receiving tithes were no longer really dependent upon them, as in the primitive stages of the redistributive system at the time of Moses. In fact, in many cases they were landowners, making the tithes not only gratuitous but redistributive in the wrong direction!

- Again, however, their program cut both ways for the peasant, for there is also halakic evidence of peasant resistance to Pharisaic attempts to enforce Sabbath regulations that prohibited sowing or harvesting on the seventh day and in the seventh year. These restrictions presented obvious hardships for the subsistence economy of the peasant, who could expect no relief from the state in hard times.

- With the emergence of the synagogue system, Torah was increasingly central to the symbolic order. It was the domain of the scribal class, which Jeremias tells us consisted of both Pharisees and Sadducees, higher and lower clergy (1969: chap. 10). The scribes dominated the Sanhedrin, which held ultimate juridical authority in Israel. This “exclusive class of Sages enjoying special privileges by reason of their engaging in study” (of Torah) maintained considerable social power and prestige (Oppenheimer, 1977:1).

- particular concern was the Pharisaic oral tradition, which represented a directly competing basis of ideological authority, for they claimed it to be parallel with Torah and traced its origins back to Moses. This confirms the social basis of the ongoing dispute between Sadducean “biblical conservatism” and Pharisaic tradition (see below, 7,C,ii). Meanwhile, apocalyptic movements, which felt excluded from the redemptive media altogether, fought back with “secret” revelations and esoteric interpretive schemes of scripture. It is of utmost significance that Mark affirms the Hebrew scriptures while rejecting the rest of the dominant symbolic order; in his Gospel we see him vying with scribes, Pharisees, and Sadducees over the issue of hermeneutic authority.

- Economically the temple dominated Jerusalem, and to a lesser extent all of Judea. Though originally intended as the “central storehouse” of the redistributive economy, it had come to represent massive capital accumulation: From the tithes and other dues to the priesthood and temple, through repayment and interest on loans, and even through the contributions which Diaspora Jews from around the world sent to the Temple, surplus wealth flowed into, and piled up in, Jerusalem. There were no mechanisms, however, by which these resources could be channeled to the people most in need…. Rather, some of the surplus wealth was used on luxury goods or simply stored in the temple treasury, in the form of valuable metals or objects [Horsley and Hanson, 1985:61].

Obviously, every Jewish social group and strategy had to take an ideological stance in relation to the temple. The Essenes, who otherwise wholly rejected the authority of the Jerusalem clergy and its social order, remained committed to the eschatological purification of the temple.

- As suggested above, the revolt was as much a reflection of class tensions as of anti-imperialist sentiment, and differences between moderates and radicals in the provisional government were largely based on class distinctions: The Zealot party was composed of dissident peasants from Judea and lower priests in Jerusalem who had been oppressed by the chief priests in the decade before the war. The early followers of Simon bar Giora were slaves and brigands who plundered the rich. Even the Idumeans who came to Jerusalem showed their distrust of the high priestly aristocracy by their readiness to support the Zealots. And the vengeance with which both the Zealots and the Idumeans treated the Jewish aristocracy can best be understood as the expression of accumulated frustration resulting from grievances against the wealthy and traditional authorities [Rhoads, 1976:178].

Thus from Mark's perspective of the Galilean poor, the revolt promised no structural relief from a political economy of elitism.

- For the Galilean peasantry, the perennial burden of the imperial tribute, the social pressure of the nearby Hellenistic cities, and then the repeated experience of retribution at the hands of Roman legions would have been more than enough to sow deep-seated alienation. At the same time there would have been a natural class alienation from the native aristocracy, whom the peasant saw not as leader but collaborator and landlord. This double antipathy could have translated into solidarity with the local social bandits and subsequently the Zealots, and for many it did, but the evidence indicates that this was a minority. We know, for example, that in Galilee the organized insurrection collapsed early, and that Josephus complained bitterly of the difficulties of trying to organize rebel resistance there. The brigand leader John of Gischala appears to have been an exception in going to join in the defense of Jerusalem, and he is himself portrayed as an unscrupulous and opportunistic merchant and landowner.

- I believe Mark's Gospel to be such a document, articulating a grassroots social discourse that is at once both subversive and constructive. This document was probably written during the Roman reoccupation of Galilee between the first and second Roman sieges of Jerusalem (see below, 11,A,ii). The immediate and specific issue occasioning the Gospel was the challenge of rebel recruiters in Galilee, who were trying to drum up support for the resistance around Palestine, and no doubt demanding that Mark's community “choose sides.” Though sympathetic to the socio-economic and political grievances of the rebels, Mark was compelled to repudiate their call to a defense of Jerusalem. This was because, according to his understanding of the teaching and practice of a Nazarene prophet, executed by Rome some thirty-five years earlier, the means (military) and ends (restorationist) of the “liberation” struggle were fundamentally counterrevolutionary.

Furthermore, it is one of the essential functions of the gospel that it facilitates a return to the archē tou euaggeliou Iēsou (1:1). This return to the beginning treats the oral failure to assure the presence of Jesus by restoring the authority of Jesus as one essentially belonging to the past.

- Because the scattered network of Christian communities had little infrastructure and poor methods of communication, the oral traditions about Jesus were doubtless subject to manipulation.

Then, as now, one could “quote” Jesus for purposes inimical to the kingdom; the many apocryphal and gnostic “gospels” from the second century testify to this tendency in the early church.

His repeated use of “antithetical aphorisms” in the discipleship catechism (below, 9,E,i) undermines orthodox notions about social power. And Mark is a master of parody. He makes a joke about the rich, declaring that it is as hard for them to be saved as for a “camel to go through the eye of a needle” (10:25)—and summarily turns the assumed relationship between piety, wealth, and blessing on its head!

Two are from the historical writings, 12 from the Psalms, 12 from Daniel, and the remaining 21 are from the other prophetic writings. An analysis of the allusions to scripture and related sacred writings gives the same general picture: of 160 such allusions, half are from the prophets (excluding Daniel), and about an eighth each from Daniel, the Psalms, the Torah, and from noncanonical writings [Kee, 1977:45].

We would expect such subversive hermeneutics from Mark, because scripture is the only aspect of the dominant symbolic order of Palestinian Judaism he does not repudiate altogether. He must necessarily be combative in his interpretation, for his opponents use the same textual tradition to support a system he is trying to delegitimize.

- This “script” is most clearly articulated in Jesus’ political parable of the vineyard tenants (12:1–11). It does not change just because the prophet has been named by the Sender as “beloved son” (12:6f.; cf. 1:11; 9:7). Just as John the Baptist “followed the script,” so too must Jesus (9:11–13). Thus Jesus’ three portents concerning his destiny (8:31f.; 9:31f.; 10:33f.) should be understood in terms of neither prediction nor predetermination, but as indications that the script is being fulfilled. Mark is at pains to reassure the reader of this throughout the tragedy of the passion narrative (14:21, 27, 49). The ideological function of this “script” is twofold. First, it lends meaning to the suffering and persecution of the prophets: Yahweh's purpose is not thereby denied but mysteriously confirmed and advanced. Secondly, it functions to exhort the disciples of Jesus, and the reader of the gospel, to themselves participate in this prophetic vocation, but with a sober realism with respect to the consequences (8:34ff.).

- Of our four Gospels, Mark has the lowest ratio of sayings to narrative action; he clearly prefers symbolic performance to extended monologue. Indeed, the structure of Mark's story is built around mission, journey, and conflict; in contrast, Matthew is composed around five “sermons” (see Mt 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1), and Luke-Acts and John emphasize long speeches. The power of the word in Mark is subordinate to that of deed: against the reflective/speculative traditions, Mark's discipleship narrative demands engagement and a response of praxis. He might well have agreed with Marx's famous dictum: “Philosophers seek to understand the world; the point, however, is to change it.” ([Location 3523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=3523))

- According to Horsley, the social function of apocalyptic was to fire the socio-political imagination of the oppressed. First, in renewing old symbols and reappropriating Hebrew narratives of liberation, it functioned as “remembering.” Secondly, it promoted a “creative envisioning” of a future in which God restored justice and a full humanity to all. And thirdly, the dualistic combat myth functioned as a “critical demystifying of the pretensions and practices of the established order”: Emperors were not divine, and high priests were not sacrosanct…. The apocalyptic imagination thus had a strengthening effect on the people's ability to endure, and even a motivating effect toward resistance or revolt [J. Collins, 1987:144].

- The second characteristic is radical apocalyptic dualism (see below, 11,D,i), in which Jesus’ new order (narrated as the “kingdom of God”) is fundamentally opposed to the old order stewarded by the scribes. Mark's story is a dramatic interpretation of the “new heaven and new earth” tradition of apocalyptic symbolics, what Wilder calls the “theatre of world-palingenesis” (1982:34). The Gospel is “directed toward the creation of new worlds: old symbols are given new meaning and new symbols come to life…. A new order of the sacred is brought into being and perceived by the community as the source of all power and meaning; new rituals emerge to remind the community of this sacred order” (Gager, 1975:11). This dualism is evident from Jesus’ first public homily about “new wine” and “old wineskins” (2:19–22; below, 4,D,i). The old order—its definitions of sacred space, social status, and cultic/political authority—is confronted and subverted through the narrative vehicle of conflict and exorcism stories. The new order—its imperatives of inclusivity, equality, servanthood, and suffering patience—is mediated through stories of conversion, miracles and healing, symbolic action, and parenetic teaching.

- the apocalyptic “combat myth.” From the very first wilderness confrontation between Jesus and his angels and Satan and his wild beasts (1:12f.), it is clear that there is more to Jesus’ struggle with the scribal order than “meets the eye.” This is a showdown with the Satanic order, as is clearly articulated in the apocalyptic parable of the strong man's house ([Location 3583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=3583))

- The essential question is, Who is “lord” of the “house” (13:35)?

- By the time Mark wrote his Gospel, Pharisaic social power was increasingly influential, so much so that after the destruction of the temple they emerged as the dominant leadership group in Judaism. It is not therefore surprising that they are portrayed by Mark as antagonistic particularly where the practice of the discipleship community is at stake (Mk 2:15ff.; 7:1ff.; 10:2ff.). It is plausible that the deviant social practice of Mark's community came under fierce Pharisaic attack on matters such as its inclusive table fellowship (7:14–23) and its criticism of Sabbath legislation (2:23ff.).

- The first subplot involves Jesus’ attempts to create and consolidate a messianic community, the subject being of course his disciples. His mandate to them is to carry on the work of the kingdom (1:17; 3:14; 6:7), but this mandate is essentially rejected once it is revealed as the way of the cross. This leads to several confrontations (6:53; 8:17ff.; 8:33, etc.), and ultimately to the failure of the disciples to follow Jesus to the cross (14:50f.). This tragedy is, however, reversed by the promise that because Jesus lives, the discipleship adventure can continue (16:6f.).

- The second subplot is Jesus’ ministry of healing, exorcism, and proclamation of liberation, the subject being the poor and oppressed, who are embodied in the “crowd” in the Gospel. The mandate appears in the first synagogue exorcism, in which the crowd acknowledges that Jesus’ authority exceeds that of their scribal overlords (1:22). By the time Jesus comes to Jerusalem, it seems that the crowd has accepted his mandate for a new social order, hailing him as popular king (11:9f.). There is an implicit confrontation with the masses in Jesus’ repudiation of national insurrection, a warning he addresses to “all” (13:37). In the end, the crowd, like the disciples, rejects Jesus, calling for a pardon for the terrorist Barabbas and execution for Jesus (15:6ff.). The consequence is that the crowd remains under the control of those who dominate it (15:11). ([Location 4013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4013))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- The third subplot is Jesus’ confrontation with the dominant socio-symbolic order, the subject being the stewards of that order: the scribes, Pharisees, Herodians, and ruling Jerusalem clergy. Jesus delivers his mandate to them several times in the first campaign of direct action, asserting his authority over the purity and debt system (2:10,28), and challenging the authorities to choose justice and compassion over domination (3:4). This is immediately rejected (3:6), and is continually rejected throughout the story (6:26; 11:27ff.; 12:13; 14:1f.). Jesus confronts each of the representative ruling groups during the second campaign narrative, conducts a direct action against their temple (11:15ff.), and appears to successfully silence them (12:34). But in the end the forces of Jewish and Roman state power join to vanquish Jesus. The consequence is that they behold the advent of the Human One, to their shame (15:29–39; cf. 8:29f.; 14:62); despite appearances, the cross event seals the doom of their domain (15:38).

- It should be noted that all three subplots contribute to the climactic crisis of Jesus’ arrest and execution, and are gathered together in the passion narrative. In the final scenes of the story we see the defecting disciples, the disillusioned crowd, and the hostile authorities, all juxtaposed to Jesus, who alone goes the way of the cross. These three narrative strands also represent the key aspects in Jesus’ messianic program: confronting the old order, constructing an alternative order, and bringing liberation to the poor.

- Mark entitles his work simply “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Messiah” (archē tou euaggeliou Iēsou Christou, 1:1). It can hardly be doubted that the archē of Mark 1:1 has a paradigmatic or metaphorical relationship to the archē (LXX) of Genesis 1:1, especially since Mark speaks of the archē of creation in 10:6…. There is another first time despite the fatigue of world-history [Via, 1985:45]. This echo of Genesis serves three functions. First, Mark is boldly suggesting that his story represents a fundamental regeneration of salvation history, as will soon be confirmed by his citation of the prophets. Secondly, it introduces at the outset the “palingenetic” thrust of Mark's apocalyptic discourse: this is a story about a new heaven and new earth. Thirdly, it has a specific meaning in light of the ending of the story (below, 13,E), where Mark will point back to the place where the discipleship narrative was originally generated—Galilee. A rereading of (reengagement with) the story offers a “new beginning” for the discipleship adventure. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4049))
- We must understand that here Mark is giving the reader privileged information, telling us what the characters in Book I are unable to grasp, ([Location 4059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4059))
- But if Mark has no intention of affirming this messianic designation in his story, why does he apply it to Jesus here in the story's masthead? As with so many elements of Mark's narrative strategy, this has to do with the story's circular character. The epithet is asserted at the “beginning,” dropped by the end, and then reasserted in the new rereading—but now understood in new terms. Mark was not prepared to abandon messianic discourse altogether, which after all was the cornerstone of the early church's confession. At the same time, Messiah was a political title, a symbol of popular kingship, and thus easily misapprehended, especially by those who wished to put it at the service of “loyalistic” rebellion (below, 11,C,iv). By affirming the designation at the outset, Mark enters into the ideological struggle over how to properly understand it. This story aims to convince us what the messianic vocation is—and, just as vigorously, what it is not. ([Location 4064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4064))
- So thoroughly religious to modern readers, what would “gospel” have connoted for Mark's first audience? A Hellenistic expression (literally “glad tidings”), it was, according to the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, “a technical term for ‘news of victory,’” especially in military battles. In the Roman empire it was especially associated with political propaganda. ([Location 4073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4073))
- Roman propaganda focused upon eulogizing Caesar as the “divine man.” This ideological strategy is well documented in coins of the period, and of course in the later emperor cults of Asia Minor. The accession to power of a new ruler was cause for “glad tidings,” and celebrations and sacrifices always followed (see Wengst, 1987: 46ff.): [Deification of the emperor] gives euangelion its significance and power….

- From this there emerges yet another dimension of Mark's title. He is serving notice that he is challenging the apparatus of imperial propagation. His dramatic prologue (but not birth narrative proper, as in Luke and Matthew) heralds the advent of an “anointed” leader, who is confirmed by the Deity and who proclaims a “kingdom.” In other words, Mark is taking dead aim at Caesar and his legitimating myths. From the very first line, Mark's literary strategy is revealed as subversive. Gospel is… ([Location 4086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4086))

- The first half of the prophecy (1:2) conflates two non-Isaian texts. The first is the heralding of a way for the Hebrew people in its journey toward liberation: Behold, I send an angel before you (LXX: apostellō ton angelon mou pro prosōpou sou) to guard you on the way (en tē hodō) and to bring you to the land I have prepared for you [Ex 23:20]. This way is identified with the way being cleared for Yahweh's advent as announced by the prophet “Malachi”:3 Behold I dispatch my messenger (LXX: exapostellō ton angelon mou) to make a way before me (hodon pro prosōpou mou) [Mal3:1a]. Both texts function to introduce “the way” as the central discipleship motif in the gospel, though it is more predominant in Book II. A great deal has been written about this motif, which I will not belabor (see Best, 1981). Mark's citation, however, substitutes a verb not… ([Location 4095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4095))

- From at least the first century C.E. onward, the ancient rabbis and scribes held that true prophecy had ended with Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi…such a view prevailed in the emerging “canonical” thinking regarding which writings were to be recognized as authoritative scripture [Horsley and Hanson, 1985:146]. Mark would have been well aware of this, and of the fact that many of his Jewish contemporaries despaired that the prophetic voice in Israel had fallen silent forever. Here, by existentializing the prophetic voice, he boldly implies that the Word of Yahweh is now again being spoken. More than this, the “Malachi” oracle specifically announces that Yahweh is about to make a dramatic appearance in history.3 The long-awaited eschatological judgment has drawn nigh at last!

- “Wilderness” (or desert, erēmos) is a second crucial coordinate of Mark's narrative world, occurring nine times in Book I. Its semantic field for Mark's Palestinian readers was a complex one, each aspect of which is relevant to Mark. In literal terms, wilderness connoted an uninhabited and desolate place, marginal existence: John lives on locusts and honey (1:6), and persons hunger there (8:2f.). Symbolically, it was the site of a community in flight (as in the exodus tradition) or a refuge for the persecuted faithful who await deliverance (as in apocalyptic literature; see Rv 12:6,14). Jesus, like Israel, is “tested” there (1:12f.); there he also seeks solitude (1:35,45). In this, both Jesus and John follow the prophetic “script” of Elijah, who also withdrew to the wilderness when hunted by the political authorities (1 Kgs 19). And geopolitically, the wilderness would have been identified with the… ([Location 4132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4132))

- The principal narrative function of wilderness in the prologue, however, where it appears four times, is ideological: it represents the “peripheries.” By inserting this coordinate in place of “Malachi's” temple (representative of the “center” as the site of Yahweh's renewed action, Mark creates a spatial tension between two archetypically opposite symbolic spaces. This wilderness/temple polarity becomes explicit in Mark's wry report—a typical Semitic hyperbole—that “all the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem” seek John in the wilderness (1:5). According to the dominant nationalist ideology of salvation history, Jerusalem was considered the hub of the world to which all nations would one day come (… ([Location 4141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4141))

- At the level of narrative, the introduction of “Elijah” here dramatically escalates the tension of expectation. What was the last cry before the prophetic voices died away? It was “Malachi's” promise/warning: “Behold I will send you Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord arrives” (Mal 4:5). The reader is thrown into turmoil: Is this the “beginning” (1:1) or “the end”? Yet the expectation is almost immediately short-circuited, for John's baptizing ministry, which Mark later acknowledges as one of considerable power and controversy (11:30), is not the subject of this Gospel. John is brought onstage only to introduce the double theme of the Gospel: the kingdom mission (the preaching of repentance and the… ([Location 4165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4165))

We will come to understand baptism “by the holy spirit” in terms of confrontation with the powers (10:38f.), the political site of discipleship under divine guidance (13:11; see below, 8,D). John's anthem of anticipation has therefore synopsized the kingdom vocation as the subsequent story will narrate it: a mission (“sandals”) to overthrow (the “stronger one”) the powers (“baptism” by the holy spirit).

- The first two scenes of Mark's story, through their careful deployment of settings and symbols, establish Mark's first thesis: the great apocalyptic novum, which invades the world at Jesus’ baptism and sets salvation history in motion again, does not occur at the center of the social order, but at its peripheries.

- Mark announces a new “beginning,” and immediately the prophetic voice awakens. “Isaiah” announces the arrival of a messenger, and John the Baptist straightaway appears in the wilderness. John in turn heralds the arrival of a “stronger one,” and Jesus abruptly comes onstage to contest the rule of Satan—only to disappear offstage into the wilderness. Thus Mark keeps postponing the fulfillment of the expectations he generates. Just when it seems the new order will be unveiled, something anticlimactic takes place, and the scene changes.

This metaphor, despite the grand old tradition of missionary interpretation, does not refer to the “saving of souls,” as if Jesus were conferring upon these men instant evangelist status. Rather, the image is carefully chosen from Jeremiah 16:16, where it is used as a symbol of Yahweh's censure of Israel. Elsewhere the “hooking of fish” is a euphemism for judgment upon the rich (Am 4:2) and powerful (Ez 29:4). Taking this mandate for his own, Jesus is inviting common folk to join him in his struggle to overturn the existing order of power and privilege.

But before retreating, he makes his intentions clear in a climactic debate with government investigators. Jesus spins a parable so shocking that it not only polarizes the political climate, but provokes a rift with family and friends. He compares himself to a thief struggling to break into the house of a “strong man,” whom he intends to bind and whose captives he intends to liberate. And he claims that in this criminal venture, his accomplice is none other than the Holy Spirit! ([Location 4417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4417))

This allows us to view 3:22–35 as a kind of “second climax” to the Capernaum campaign, followed by the “narrative rest” represented by the first sermon in 4:1ff. The transition to the next section is signaled at the conclusion of this sermon, when the site of the seashore is abandoned for a boat journey across the sea (4:35ff.).

- The major plot dynamic in the section is the way in which Jesus’ practice—specifically his healing, exorcism, and solidarity with the socially outcast—brings him into conflict with the authorities. At the outset of Jesus’ ministry to the masses, Mark introduces an implied complication, though it is traditionally dismissed by form and redaction critics as arbitrary detail. We are told that Jesus commences public healing only at the close of his Sabbath day's (1:21) activity (1:32). Despite the fact that he has already healed Peter's mother-in-law privately in her home, Jesus waits for the Sabbath to end before going public. We are thus alerted that healing on the Sabbath is going to be controversial. This sets the tone for the following narrative: Jesus’ healing again defies the debt code in 2:1ff., and in 2:24 the… ([Location 4479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4479))
- issue results in Jesus’ Deuteronomic ultimatum to his opponents concerning the meaning of Sabbath (3:4), and his fateful choice to provoke the issue by breaching the law in what we might call “theatrical civil disobedience.” The resolution of this plot complication, however, only serves to provoke another: the secret plan to arrest Jesus (3:6). By introducing this development so early in the story (Jesus in fact is not arrested until 14:43!) Mark politicizes the entire subsequent narrative. The reader can thus hardly be surprised when the final episode in this section escalates the intensity of conflict, as authorities come all the way from Jerusalem to investigate the problem (3:21). Their counterattack provides Jesus with a pretext to make the political purpose of his mission explicit in his apocalyptic “strong man” parable.

- Is Jesus simply “curing” the physically sick and the mentally disturbed? If so, why would such a ministry of compassion raise the ire of the local authorities? Many commentators, anxious to portray Jesus as a politically innocuous miracle worker, have argued that the political opposition to him was based upon a tragic misunderstanding. This is social and historical nonsense: healers and magicians abounded and practiced freely in Hellenistic antiquity, but Jesus encounters official hostility almost from the outset. In the double-climax to this section, he is politically accused for both his healings (3:1–6) and his exorcisms (3:22–30). There must be more to these stories than is immediately obvious to the modern reader. ([Location 4499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4499))

- The flow of dramatic action confirms this. Jesus has penetrated symbolic space acknowledged to be the domain of the scribes. No sooner has he stepped onto their turf than he encounters stiff opposition: “Immediately there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit” (1:23). The demon's challenge to Jesus (1:24) is a curious phrase in Greek (ti hēmin kai soi;), translated by Taylor as “What do we have in common?” He suggests that the idiom is drawn from the Hebrew of Joshua 22:24, Judges 11:12, and 1 Kings 17:18, rendered there as “Why do you meddle with us?” (1963:174).

- Exorcism is one of the central characteristics of the messianic mission of Jesus (1:39; 3:11), and he will pass this vocation on to his followers (3:15; 6:7). It is the main vehicle for articulating the apocalyptic combat myth between the powers (and their earthly minions) and Jesus (as envoy of the kingdom). Although Jesus’ identity is hidden to the protagonists (e.g., the disciples) in the story, the demons know exactly who he is. Clearly understanding the political threat he poses to the status quo, they struggle to “name” (that is, to control) him (1:34; 3:11f.). This apocalyptic drama will reach fever pitch in the debate over Beelzebub (3:22ff.), in which the scribal authorities launch a counterattack in the war of myths, and will climax when Jesus succeeds in turning the tables and extracting from a demon his name (5:9; below 6,B). Mark thus establishes the political character of exorcism as symbolic action.

- Mark's Jesus seeks always to restore the social wholeness denied to the sick/impure by this symbolic order. That is why his healing of the sick/impure is virtually interchangeable with his social intercourse with them. To one “leper” he offers a declaration of wholeness (1:41ff.), to another simply the solidarity of table fellowship (14:3). Both acts defy the symbolic order that segregates those lacking bodily integrity; both challenge the prevailing social boundaries and class barriers.

- Throughout this commentary I will interpret the “miracles” of Jesus—exorcism and healing—as “symbolic action.” This will undoubtedly trouble some readers, who will take me to be implying that these events did not really take place, that Jesus did not really heal or cast out demons. That is not what I mean by symbolic action. Similarly, in speaking of specific characters or narrative elements in these stories as socio-symbolic representations, as I have done in the case of the synagogue exorcism, I am not suggesting that Jesus did not in fact minister to or care about individual victims. By “symbolic action” I do not mean action that was merely metaphorical, devoid of concrete, historical character. Quite the contrary: I mean action whose fundamental significance, indeed power, lies relative to the symbolic order in which they occurred.

- Let me illustrate what I mean with two examples. When Martin Luther tacked up his theses on the Wittenberg door, the meaning of his action extended far beyond the sum of its parts. Literally the act was that of a monk posting a note on a door; but it was not any note on any door, and history would prove this was not just any monk. Indeed, this powerful symbolic act of resistance came to take on bigger-than-life proportions, becoming an “etiological myth” of the later Lutheran Church. Yet its true historical significance can properly be understood only in terms of the socio-political configuration of forces within the dominant form of Catholicism that the dissident Luther was addressing.

- Take now the monk's namesake, Martin Luther King, Jr. When King knelt and prayed in the face of police dogs and water cannons, or when his colleagues sat at lunch counters or at the front of city buses, they were engaging in symbolic actions. Their significance cannot be interpreted apart from factors of socio-symbolic “space” (segregation in the southern U.S.A.) and “codes” (discriminatory law and tradition). In these examples we can see actions whose historical character was not diminished for their being “symbolic.” Nor are they any less “miraculous” for being nonsupernatural. Their “divine power” lay not in a manipulation of nature but in confrontation with the dominant order of oppression and in witness to different possibilities.

- The “miracle” of the exodus story lies not in the nature epiphanies and plagues, but in the liberation of the Hebrew people from slavery in pharaoh's Egypt.

- sum, Jesus’ symbolic acts were powerful not because they challenged the laws of nature, but because they challenged the very structures of social existence. To use Douglas's term, his healing and exorcism functioned to “elaborate” the dominant symbolic order, unmasking the way in which it functioned to legitimate concrete social relationships. Insofar as this order dehumanized life, Jesus challenged it and defied its strictures: that is why his “miracles” were not universally embraced. Depending upon one's status in the dominant order, one either perceived them as socially deviant (worse, heretical) or liberative. ([Location 4660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4660))
- Even in an overwhelmingly biomedical culture such as ours, what is “healthy” is still socially determined. The recent controversy surrounding AIDS demonstrates the persistence of popular myth and political epidemiology in our contemporary health care system. An even better example, which bears directly upon our reading of Mark, is the challenge being put to traditional definitions of physical and mental “disability” by the contemporary movements for independent living in developed societies. Wheelchair-bound persons, for example, insist on equal social access, decrying paternal and oppressive social policies that keep them dependent and segregated. Similarly, many in the deaf community insist that their unique culture, centered around sign language, should be given equal respect and treatment as any verbal sign system. In other words, there are many today who simply do not believe that their liberation is dependent upon being able to talk or walk. They insist on their right to live fully human and “whole” lives in a society that continues to define them as “handicapped” only because they are different. Nonphysically disabled readers must be aware of the biases we unconsciously bring to biblical narratives of “healing.” Obviously any interpretation that stresses the biomedical definition of “wholeness” excludes the physically disabled from the good news. If, however, we focus upon the broader socio-symbolic meaning of illness and healing, the stories address us all equally. After all, in Mark the true impediments to discipleship have nothing to do with physical impairment, but with spiritual and ideological disorders: “Having eyes can you not see? Having ears can you not hear?” (8:18). ([Location 4666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4666))
- 1:21–38 Mark offers a portrait of Jesus’ ministry in microcosm, using the fiction of a “typical” 24-hour span. It begins on the Sabbath (1:21), goes through sundown (1:32) and on into the early morning of the next day (1:35). Mark ends the section with a recapitulative summary statement (1:39). This synopsis tells us not only what Jesus does (healing, preaching, and exorcism), but also where he does it. And the fact is that prior to the passion narrative in 14:1ff., Mark is far more concerned with the socio-symbolism of narrative sites than with coherent movement through space or time.

- The first observation we should make is that there is a public/private dialectic in Jesus’ movement, with the former consistently exerting pressure on the latter. The synagogue exorcism concluded (1:28) with Jesus’ sudden attainment of “fame” (the expression is literally “the hearing about him”—i.e., the reports and rumors, he akoē autou). Mark tells us of two attempts by Jesus to withdraw. He first seeks the privacy of his disciples’ family home (1:29), but soon the crowd finds him there (1:32). Again he seeks solitude, this time in the wilderness; yet even there he is found (1:37). But in each case Jesus responds to the demand, as reflected in his announcement that he will itinerate the village circuit (1:38).

- Taking her lead, I would identify Mark's primary topographical sites as wilderness, river, sea, and mountain. These are all positive coordinates in the narrative, with the exception of the last two, which have negative counterparts. The mountain is a place of commissioning (3:13), solitude (6:46), and revelation (9:2,9) for the discipleship community. But once the narrative moves to Jerusalem, Mark draws an opposition between the Mount of Olives (positive, 11:1; 13:3,14; 14:26) and the temple “mount” (negative, 11:23). This, as we will see, is an ideological tension (below, 10,A,ii). Similarly, in Book I the sea (of Galilee) is a prime positive coordinate; by it the discipleship narrative commences (1:16; 2: 13) and consolidates (3:7; 4:1). Yet it is also a symbol of opposition in the boat journeys (4:47; 6:48f.), and a symbol of destruction in 5:13, 9:42, and 11:23.

This opposition is articulated in the prologue as wilderness/Jerusalem and Galilee/Judea (above, 3,E). There is yet another expression of it in tension between urban and rural settings implied in these opening scenes. Capernaum was a “city” (polis, 1:33), “a reasonably well-known townlet…standing close to the highway which ran northeastwards from the lake into lower Syria” (Pearlman and Yannai, 1965). Yet after the synagogue conflict and Jesus’ two attempts to retreat, Jesus tells his disciples that his mission is to preach not in the cities, but “in the neighboring country towns” (1:38, kōmopoleis).

Obviously it does not signify a social strategy of monastic withdrawal, for each of Mark's two “campaign” narratives take place in cities.

- We should also recall our working model of the symbolic order (above, 2,E,ii), which identifies the major spheres of agrarian Palestine as land/table (the economic), village/house (the social), and synagogue/sanctuary (the political). There is clear correlation between these spheres and the narrative throughout the Gospel. Besides the tension between the positive sphere of village/house and negative sphere of synagogue/temple, table fellowship will emerge as a primary site of conflict (e.g., 2:15f.; 7:1ff.). The “field” is also a site of confrontation (2:23ff.), whereas the land is both a potentially positive and negative sphere in Jesus’ parables (4:1ff.). In sum, in his careful use of socio-symbolic space, Mark portrays Jesus as struggling against the dominant symbolic order as it manifests itself in each social sphere in his mission of liberation.

- C.H. Cave, following J. Weiss, argues that this term meant not “to cleanse” but “to declare clean” in the Levitical sense.

This episode may well be a kind of midrash (commentary) on the “Malachi” oracle Mark has already cited in his prologue (1:2).

- choosing to introduce the language of the debt code, Jesus is elaborating the symbolics of hierarchy. The man's lack of bodily wholeness would have been attributed to either his own sin, or, if a birth defect, inherited sin; he was thus denied full status in the body politic of Israel (above, B,ii). Jesus summarily releases him from all debt—hence restoring his social wholeness and thus his personhood, which in turn is equated with the restoration of physical wholeness. The man walks, and the crowd glorifies God: the “body” (physical/social) has been restored (2:12). Once again, the crowd is amazed (cf.1:27) that Jesus has out-duelled the scribes.

- Their complaint that none but God can remit debt (2:7b) is not a defense of the sovereignty of Yahweh, but of their own social power. As Torah interpreters and co-stewards of the symbolic order, they control determinations of indebtedness. But as Jesus did with the priestly prerogative, he has also expropriated this function. Faced with this threat, the scribes accuse Jesus in the strongest possible language: “He blasphemes!” (2:7a). This will ultimately be the charge for which Jesus is condemned to death at the end of the story (14:64). Though here it is not yet pressed, it is no accident that the next time the scribal authorities appear it is in the person of government investigators from Jerusalem (3:22).

For now what is noteworthy is the fact that Mark has taken a recognized “heavenly” entity and claimed for it authority “on earth,” specifically over the debt code.

- is of no small significance that Mark chooses this scene to introduce his term for “disciples” (tois mathētais). It seems he wants to stress here that Jesus’ disciples may freely mix with “sinners,” because Jesus’ repudiation of the debt code has made everyone equal again before God. There are now only sinners on the road of discipleship, as Jesus will argue in 2:17.

- Jesus’ defense appeals to 1 Samuel 21:1–6. Mark's wry poke—“Have you never read?”—prepares us for an ingenuous bit of exposition on his part. Jesus claims the precedent of David's assertion of his kingly right to violate the law when he and his followers (the Greek is emphatic) were in need (chreian eschen). Now David, Derrett points out (ibid.), was in that instance on an important campaign, and essentially “commandeered” bread for his soldiers. Mark will use the same terminology in describing Jesus’ “need” when he “commandeers” an ass during his march on Jerusalem (11:3f.). The point would seem to be that the disciples have a right to commandeer grain, because they too are on a campaign with Jesus, who will… ([Location 4955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4955))
- But to think the point of this story is Jesus’ “christological prerogative,” as do most commentators, is to miss the real issue. It has been argued that Jesus’ defense does not conform to the rules of rabbinic argumentation from scripture, but that should come as no surprise (Cohn-Sherbok, 1979). Indeed, closer examination reveals that Mark has added something to his (already free) rendition of the Old Testament story: David and his men were hungry. L. Schottroff and W. Stegemann, in a recent redaction-critical study of this text, have pointed out that Matthew, Mark's first interpreter, clearly understood Mark's point to be the issue of “mercy, not sacrifice” (Mt 12:7; cf. Hos 6:6): “The hunger of the poor is explained in a symbolic way as setting Israel its central religious task, one taking precedence even over the duty of observing the Sabbath” (1984:125). It is surely significant also that Mark chooses this passage to introduce the term “bread” (arton, 2:26). This will figure decisively in the later narrative as a symbol of that which must be shared—not least in the stories of the feeding of hungry masses in the wilderness (6:33ff.;8:1ff.).

- In all three episodes in which the Pharisees figure, Mark has focused upon some aspect of food consumption. First Jesus defended his (and his disciples’) right to break bread with the socially outcast. Then he asserts their freedom to ignore ritual noneating practices; such piety, after all, was a luxury for the affluent, not for the poor for whom hunger was an involuntary and bitter reality! Now Mark escalates his attack: he justifies the disciples’ right to break the law by procuring grain on the Sabbath in a situation of hunger.

- The Pharisees played an ambiguous role in matters of production, consumption, and distribution of produce in rural Palestine (above, 2,E,iii). On the one hand, since the time of the Hasmoneans they had been consistent critics of the centralized tithing structure, which dictated that agricultural tithes had to be brought to Jerusalem. The Pharisees advocated local distribution, to ensure that provincial priests received their due. But what the rural producers gained in terms of local control over the separation of tithes they lost in terms of both production and consumption. There is evidence in the halachic tradition of tension between Galilean peasants and the Pharisees over issues of marketing produce, for the latter determined what was and was not suitable for consumption according to strict purity rules. This is perhaps also implied in the disciples’ plucking of grain: once produce was detached from the ground,… ([Location 4977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=4977))
- The disciples’ commandeering grain against Sabbath regulations must from this perspective be seen as a protest of “civil disobedience” over the politics of food in Palestine. Jesus is not only defending discipleship practice against the alternative holiness code of Pharisaism, he is going on the offensive, challenging the ideological control and the manipulation of the redistributive economy by a minority whose elite status is only aggrandized. Mark consistently argues that solidarity with the poor also means addressing oppressive structures.

- The disciples’ violation of the Sabbath leads directly into another conflict story (3:1–6). At least one commentator has suggested: [2:24] may be the legal warning necessary before actual prosecution on a charge can be made…. In 2:28 Jesus asserts his authority over the sabbath, an answer not acceptable under Jewish Law. Then in 3:2, the opponents are watching Jesus in order to accuse him legally if he violates the sabbath…. If he acts illegally on the sabbath in 3:1–6, he is liable to arrest…. The claim of Jesus in 2:28 prepares the reader for the higher level of hostility and the greater stakes involved in 3:1–6 [Dewey, 1980:100].

- André Trocmé, in his provocative book Jesus and the Nonviolent Revolution (1964), argued that this episode, as the turning point of Jesus’ public ministry, represents carefully staged political theater. Jesus could presumably heal the man with the withered hand in private without provoking a reaction (as in 1:29), but chooses yet again to force the issue. Under the glare of media lights, as it were, with the hostile officials hovering, waiting for Jesus to “cross the line,” Mark finally resolves the lingering subplot concerning healing on the Sabbath (see 1:32). As in the modern practice of civil disobedience, which might break the law in order to raise deeper issues of its morality and purpose, so Jesus, just before “crossing the line,” issues a challenge to his audience. Pitting his mission of compassion and justice to the poor against the imperatives of the dominant order, Jesus calls the entire ideological edifice of the law to account. He paraphrases the watershed question of Deuteronomic faith (Dt 30:15ff.): “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do evil?” (3:4). He then adds bitterly, “To save life, or to kill?,” drawing a sharp contrast between his messianic intentions and those of his opponents (apokteinai is always used by Mark in reference to political execution; see 6:19; 8:31; 12:5; 14:1).

These three will emerge in the story as a kind of “inner circle” of the community, but the list is not intended to represent an exclusive cadre of disciples. Levi, who was also called to follow, is not named; seven others who are named (Philip through Simon) do not appear again.

- The scribes use a double euphemism for Satan.

Mt 10:25). The second is “prince of the demons” (en tō archonti tōn daimoniōn), echoing the “principalities and powers” language found throughout the New Testament (e.g., 1 Cor 2:6; Eph 2:2).

It is Jesus’ declaration of ideological war with the scribal establishment. Having laid his opponents bare, Jesus then drops his semantic jousting and spins a thinly veiled political parable in which he likens his mission to criminal breaking and entering: No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods (ta skeuē) unless the strong man is first bound (dēsē); then indeed his house may be plundered [3:27].

- Mark has come clean: Jesus (a.k.a. the “stronger one” heralded by John, 1:8) intends to overthrow the reign of the strong man (a.k.a. the scribal establishment represented by the demon of 1:24). In this parable the oracle of Second Isaiah lives again: Yahweh is making good on the promise to liberate the “prey of the strong (LXX, ischuontos) and rescue the captives of the tyrants” (Is 49:24f.). Imperial hermeneutics, ever on the side of law and order, will of course find this interpretation of the strong man parable strained, offensive, shocking. Yet Mark drew the image of breaking and entering from the most enduring of the primitive Christian eschatological traditions: the Lord's advent as a thief in the night (Mt 24:43 par; 1 Thes 5:2,4; 2 Pt 3:10; Rv 3:3, 16:15).

- As if to underscore the seriousness of what he has just said, Jesus concludes with a solemn “Amen” saying (3:28). He now deals the final blow to the debt code: blanket pardon. But there is one exception: mistaking the work of the Holy Spirit for that of Satan. As Juan Luis Segundo puts it: The blasphemy resulting from bad apologetics will always be pardonable…. What is not pardonable is using theology to turn real human liberation into something odious. The real sin against the Holy Spirit is refusing to recognize, with “theological” joy, some concrete liberation that is taking place before one's very eyes [1979:254]. This is what the scribal class cannot “see.” Thus by the close of his defense, Jesus has turned the tables completely upon his opponents: it is they who are aligned against God's purposes. To be captive to the way things are, to resist criticism and change, to brutally suppress efforts at humanization—is to be bypassed by the grace of God.

His family had attempted to “seize” him, a word used elsewhere in Mark for political detainment (6:17; 12:12; 14:1,44,46,49,51). In light of Jesus’ militant declaration, they redouble their efforts: Mark reports in 1:31 that his mother and brothers are outside the house summoning him.

- I have mentioned that kinship was the axis of the social world in antiquity. The extended family structure determined personality and identity, controlled vocational prospects, and most importantly facilitated socialization. For Mark, then, kinship is the backbone of the very social order Jesus is struggling to overturn, which explains his utter disinterest in Jesus’ family line (in contrast to the genealogies of Mt and Lk). The anomaly of the picture he draws speaks clearly to the impending rift: his family is “outside” the house (3:31), whereas the crowd sits around Jesus “inside” (3:32). This suggests a new dualism; not unlike the “war oracles” of Qumran and other apocalyptic narrative, polarization ends in a new definition of “insiders” and “outsiders.” The alienation between Jesus and his family is mutual, and he refuses to see them (3:33). If they cannot accept his vocation, he cannot recognize their kindredness. Mark then introduces a new kinship model, based upon obedience, not to the family or clan patriarch, but to God alone (3:35). Jesus’ challenge to the traditional authority structures of Palestinian society is now complete.

- The first kingdom campaign has ended in polarization, and the messianic community has been forced to break with the social mainstream. It is not surprising therefore that Mark's Jesus should withdraw once again to reflect upon his mission. The famous parables chapter is the first of Jesus’ two extended sermons in Mark's Gospel. Drawing upon images of the land and the hardened wisdom of peasant life, this sermon offers hope in the face of overwhelming odds, and introduces the discourse of revolutionary paradox into the story.

- Following the conclusion of each of the two campaigns of direct action, Jesus withdraws from the site of conflict and sits down to offer an extended reflection (4:1f.; 13:3). The primary discursive characteristic of the first homily is parabolic, and the second apocalyptic, but each includes aspects of the other. We see apocalyptic motifs in the first sermon (e.g., special instruction to “insiders,” 4:9–13; light/darkness dualism, 4:22; the image of “harvest,” 4:29) and parables in the second (e.g., the fig tree, 13:28f.; the watchful householder 13:34–36).

- The sower parable reflects frankly upon the obstacles encountered by the messianic mission. The disciples will inherit this mission (3:13ff.), and when they are later dispatched on it (6:7ff.), Jesus’ words to them include instructions about what to do with the inevitable prospect of rejection (6:11). It is for this reason that Mark cites Isaiah 6, because this text is also concerned with “apostolicity” (“Whom shall I send?” Is 6:8). The “command” to obscure the truth is a prophetic fiction based upon the tradition that Yahweh “hardens the hearts” of political opponents, as Yahweh did with the pharaoh (Ex 7:14,22, etc.).

- The apocalyptic tradition, Mark included, adopts this fiction, whose purpose is to explain political hostility toward the movement, and intensifies it into a dualism: the word of God polarizes.

- Isaiah 6:10 in speaking of “forgiveness” instead of “healing” as in the LXX, but fails to recognize the narrative purpose for this change. Who is it that Jesus has just warned may be excluded from God's forgiveness? His scribal rivals, who contest his ministry of liberation (3:29). It is they who will listen and yet not hear, a “deafness” that is also a part of the prophetic “script” (11:1ff.). ([Location 5268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5268))
- Isaiah's “commission” ends with his cry of despair—“How long, O Lord?”—to which the divine voice responds by foretelling the overwhelming decimation to come (Is 6:11–13). This motif was also adopted by the apocalyptic movement (e.g., Dn 12:6ff.; Rv 6:9ff.), and by Mark in his second sermon (13:4ff.). Isaiah concludes his oracle with the promise of a “remnant stump” that will be the “holy seed” (Is 6:13), and several commentators have acknowledged that Mark's seed parables may well represent a midrash upon this very theme (Evans, ([Location 5272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5272))
- In the allegoristic tradition, parables are still popularly exposited in the churches today as “earthly stories with heavenly meanings.” But this is exactly what they are not! The parables are perfectly consistent with Mark's overall strategy of realistic narrative, in which any and all apocalyptic symbolics are kept “grounded.” Jesus insists upon articulating the “mystery of the kingdom of God” in utterly mundane, indeed agrarian terms: it is like this! In describing the frustrations and hopes of any peasant farmer, Mark's Jesus is not exalting the terrestrial into the heavens, or shrouding the plain and common in arcane mysticism, but rather bringing ([Location 5282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5282))
- The carefully staged scene in 4:1f., however, lends a certain spatial tension between Jesus and the crowds, which appears to echo the tension in the previous scene between Jesus’ family “outside” and those around him inside the house (3:31f.). Given the sermon's attention to Jesus’ explanations to his inner circle (4:13ff.,34), this setting at the very outset suggests the dualism between “insiders” (the boat “on the sea” is later a place of special teaching; see 8:13ff.) and “outsiders” (the crowd “next to the sea on the land”).

- The parable proper is framed by the command: “Listen!” (4:3,9; akouete). This echoes not only the great command of Yahweh to the people (“Hear, O Israel,” Dt 6:4, quoted in Mk 12:29), but also the heavenly voice to the disciples (Mk 9:7). After introducing the notion of “mystery” (4:11) and “obduracy” (4:12), Mark has Jesus “privately” explicate the parable. This allegorical interpretation exposits the sower as the proclamation of the kingdom, while the hostile soil is representative of three concrete obstacles to the acceptance of the call to discipleship. Each kind of fruitless seed represents a type of “nondisciple,” and significantly Mark will return to dramatize each obstacle later in his discipleship catechism (Mk 8:27ff.).

- Jeremias points out that the Palestinian farmer might typically expect a yield of around 7:1, with a tenfold yield considered a bumper crop. The parable's harvest thus symbolically represents a dramatic shattering of the vassal relationship between peasant and landlord. With such surplus, the farmer could not only eat and pay his rent, tithes, and debts, but indeed even purchase the land, and thus end his servitude forever. “The kingdom is like this,” says Jesus: it envisions the abolition of the oppressive relationships of production that determined the horizons of the Palestinian farmer's social world. Such images strongly suggest that Mark is articulating an ideology of the land, and the revolutionary hopes of those who work it.

- At each end of the campaign the exorcist confronts the scribal authorities (1:20ff.; 3:21ff.). This struggle is then reiterated at two crucial points during the campaign where Mark appeals to the Danielic Human One: 1. he has authority on earth to forgive sins (2:10); 2. he is lord even over the Sabbath (2:28). Mark has incarnated the combat myth in the concrete political geography of Palestine, specifically referring to the redemptive mechanism of the debt system. Having established the subversive character of the Human One “on earth,” Mark will leave this persona for the time being, to return to him in 8:31ff.

- paradox is first articulated through the seed parables. They explain to us the anticlimax of the prologue, in which the dramatic proclamation of the kingdom's imminence was followed not by cosmic upheaval but by the calling of some fishermen (1:15–20). The kingdom is like that: planting seeds of the new order in the midst of the old, in common persons called to the messianic vocation. The patience of the farmer (4:26f.) warns that the powers cannot be overthrown by seizing power. Indeed, the “Listen!” of the first sermon anticipates the “Listen to him!” of the heavenly voice, which confirms Jesus’ call to the cross in the second apocalyptic moment (9:7). But let there be no mistake: the sermon's counsel to patience in no way mitigates the nonviolent militance of the first campaign. After all, the next narrative cycle is again launched with the Gerasene exorcism, a highly political symbolic confrontation with Roman imperialism.

- Jesus understands that the crucible of political hostility and persecution facing his movement will demand a disciplined “vanguard,” and it is these whom he seeks to instruct in the “mystery of the kingdom” (4:11). Still, Mark has no sooner acknowledged these new “lines” than he begins to diffuse them. Jesus disavows his teaching as secret gnosis (4:22f.), and throughout the next section of narrative the new dualism will begin to break down. By the end of the first half of the Gospel, “insiders” have become “outsiders” because of their lack of understanding (8:18f.)!

- Mark constructs his story around a dialectic of public engagement and private withdrawal, a distinction that persists even in the first sermon. Though Jesus is often forced into temporary hiding, Mark does not endorse a strategy of permanent underground residence, emerging only for hit-and-run guerilla actions (below, 7,A). Rather, his portrait of Jesus’ itinerant circulation is one of action and reflection. This is significant in light of the social strategies of other movements in Mark's time, which tended toward the extremes of either monastic withdrawal (the Essenes) or covert terrorism (the sicarii).

- Though a few scholars have speculated that Mark was describing the practice of an extremist table fellowship sect within mainstream Pharisaism (the perushim; see Wilde, 1974:196; below, 7,C), I have argued that the series protests the degree to which the Pharisees exercised control over the Galilean economy. In any case the particular vitality of this conflict (reflected again in 7:1ff.) gives us a sense of the intense rivalry between Mark's community and the Pharisees, whose “holiness” program directly competed with Markan practice. Mark is realistic about how difficult it will be to promote solidarity and social equality with the dispossessed classes. He understands that the true barriers to justice are the legitimating ideologies, and these Jesus sets about undermining.

- Having completed a reading of the first main cycle of Mark's narrative of Jesus, we may note the remarkable affinity between his portrait of the messianic socio-political strategy and Gandhi's satyagraha. Gandhi also repudiated the caste system, which segregated India's “untouchables” (harijan). He founded a disciplined community (ashram), which shared life with the poor. And he nonviolently assaulted the economic and political structures that undergirded an imperial system of privilege and exploitation. Because of his firm alignment with the poor and their interests, Gandhi too became a target, not only of the British but also the Indian aristocratic classes.

- Mark's narrative, like satyagraha, legitimizes militant, direct action, yet at the same time severs any absolute relationship between such action and historical efficacy. It is up to the disciple/reader to sow the seed of the kingdom through nonviolent witness—but it is up to God to bring that seed to fruition. And by refusing to personify the enemy in the human face of the opposition, Mark affirms another cardinal characteristic of nonviolence, what Martin King called the “beloved community.” The struggle for justice must always find a way to include its opponents in its vision of the future; just as no disciple is infallible, no adversary is “disposable.” ([Location 5550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5550))

- In the second major narrative section of the Gospel, Mark's socio-literary strategy shifts from the symbolics of repudiation to the symbolics of reconstruction. Jesus’ healing, feeding, and journeying articulate the forging of a new order in the very midst of the old one with which he broke in the Capernaum campaign. The disciple/reader has witnessed the Jesus who confronts the powers in militant nonviolence, and has been instructed about revolutionary patience by a withdrawn and reflective Jesus. Now we will receive one object lesson after another regarding the alternative kingdom practice of inclusivity and compassion from a Jesus who silences the storms and walks on water—that is, who breaks through the social and economic barriers to the realization of human solidarity.

- The socio-literary function of the first section of Mark's Gospel was to tear down the “sacred canopy” that legitimizes what Mark perceived as oppressive social institutions.

- Commentators have long puzzled over the so-called double miracle cycle in Mark 4:35–8:21. Outstanding are several parallel doublets: an exorcism that has close affinity to the first of Jesus’ exorcisms (5:1ff.), two sea-rescue stories (4:36–41; 6:47–52), and two wilderness feedings (6:33–44; 8:1–10). Why would Mark, an author otherwise relatively spare in style, suddenly become repetitive here? ([Location 5584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5584))
- Parallelism interrupts the merely sequential flow of content through a systematic repetition that requires readers and hearers to move forth and back through the text rather than simply straight through it. Once a parallel is discerned it becomes necessary to pause, however momentarily, and synthesize the relations between the parallels before moving forward through the text ([Location 5591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5591))
- It is the parallels between the Capernaum and Gerasene exorcisms that first alert us to this wider scheme (below, 6,B). For Kelber, the two parallel sea-rescue stories and respective returns represent the crossing between “Jewish” and “gentile” sides of the sea (below, 6,C). Each cycle then consists of a pair of healing episodes (below, 6,D) and nearly identical conclusions: the feedings of the multitudes, followed by boat trips in which the disciples fail to understand the meaning of “bread” (below, 6,E). ([Location 5616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5616))

- reader at the close of this section. In the next chapter, I will turn to the three main elements that lie outside the parallelism. The first element is the second “generative seam” (6:1–13, 30–32), which is represented as a land journey away from the narrative center of the sea (below, 7,A). The second is the flashback account of the execution of John the Baptist by Herod (6:14–29). This “interlude” is widely recognized as parenthetical, in which Mark interrupts his own story for purposes of keeping the political implications of the ministry of the kingdom in the foreground (see below, 7,B). The third element is the one direct conflict episode in this section, in which Jesus defends his community's practice of social inclusivity against the criticism of the Pharisees (6:53–7:20). This controversy is fundamental to the new social model being articulated in Jesus’ symbolic action, for it addresses the main ideological barrier to the construction of an ecumenical community—purity/dietary regulations surrounding table fellowship (below, 7,C). I will then look at Mark's “interpretive epilogue” with which he closes the first half of the Gospel (8:10–21; below, 7,D ([Location 5637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5637))
- The primary narrative site is the boat upon the sea, and the section ends when this site is abandoned: With the completion in 8:22 of a sea crossing begun in 8:13, both the boat and the sea cease to play a role in the narrative. Neither “motif” appears again in 8:27–16:8. Consequently, 4:1–8:26 is clearly distinguished from the preceding and following narratives by the roles the sea and the boat play in it [N. Petersen, 1980:194]. ([Location 5649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5649))
- Any Galilean could relate to the danger of being caught in a sudden, fierce storm upon the sea. Even so, the sea, like the boat, has fundamentally symbolic connotations. Malbon (1984:364) points out that Mark is the first writer to refer to the inland, freshwater lake (limne) as a “sea” (thalassa), in order to invoke images from the Hebrew scriptures, as we shall see. ([Location 5654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5654))
- There is one major plot development in the course of this section: the growing tension between Jesus and his disciples. The disciples figure in almost every episode in this section, with the exception of the three gentile healings/exorcisms. Tension is introduced when the disciples wonder out loud who Jesus might be, in the first boat story (4:41), and culminates in Jesus’ exasperation in the last boat story (8:14ff.). Mark builds this drama around the theme of “blindness/deafness” introduced by Isaiah's dark warning in the first sermon (4:12): there is something crucial about the symbolics of Jesus that his disciples fail to understand. In closing the first half of his Gospel by posing an unanswered question to the disciples, Mark is of course actually addressing the reader. He is cautioning us not to proceed with the story until we have fully grasped the meaning of Jesus’ actions. ([Location 5657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5657))

- The city of Gerasa was some thirty miles southeast of the seaside locale implied in the story. It may be that Mark's point was simply to establish “the other side of the sea” as gentile socio-symbolic space. Thus he identified the country around Gerasa broadly as the Decapolis (5:20), a Hellenistic region given a generic name (the “ten towns”): the loose confederation of territories that represented the eastern frontier of the Roman empire, beyond which lay the Arabian steppes. But there may be a more specifically ideological reason for Mark's identification of this episode with Gerasa, as I will point out below.

- The elements of the setting contribute to its unmistakably gentile character. The demoniac's dwelling among the tombs and the presence and role of the pigs symbolize impurity according to the Jewish cultural code (tombs and swine are in fact connected in Is 65:4f.). It is perhaps relevant that Herod Antipas had built a major Hellenistic city that became his capital, Tiberias, on the shores of the sea not far from where Mark places this story. The king had to coerce Jews to populate the city, because it was considered unclean: it had been constructed on the site of a graveyard (G. A. Smith, 1931:289ff.).

- In this, the most dramatic exorcism in the Gospel, Jesus puts an end to the efforts by the demons (a.k.a. the powers) to “name” him, by turning the tables. In 5:9 Jesus wrests from this powerful demonic horde its name: Legion. A Latinism, this term had only one meaning in Mark's social world: a division of Roman soldiers. Alerted by this clue, we discover that the rest of the story is filled with military imagery. The term used for “herd” (agelē, 5:11)—inappropriate for pigs, who do not travel in herds—often was used to refer to a band of military recruits (Derrett, 1979:5).

- The conclusion is irresistible that we are here encountering imagery meant to call to mind the Roman military occupation of Palestine. Having been confronted by the Jewish ruling class in the scribally controlled synagogue, Jesus here meets the “other half” of the colonial condominium: the demon now represents Roman military power. In the symbolic act of exorcism, the legion “begged him (parekalei auton) earnestly not to send them out of the country” (5:10)! Nor is it surprising that there would be worried opposition to such an “expulsion” from the residents of the Decapolis, given the concrete experience of the Roman scorched-earth campaign of reconquest. Thus, in direct contrast to the legion's petition, the locals “begged him (parekalein auton) to leave their district” (5:17). And in yet a third contrast, the “liberated man” begs permission (parekalei auton) to join Jesus “in the boat” (5:18). But it is not quite time for the ecumenical community, and Jesus dispatches the man back to the Decapolis to tell the good news that liberation has come, to the amazement of all (5:19f.).

- a socio-literary interpretation reads the exorcism more broadly as public symbolic action. The demoniac represents collective anxiety over Roman imperialism. What Fanon called the “colonization of the mind,” in which the community's anguish over its subjugation is repressed and then turned in on itself, is perhaps implied by Mark's report that the man inflicts violence on himself (5:5). The formidable grip by which the powers hold the community is vividly portrayed in the opening lines (5:3–5). Mark carefully uses phrases that he has already loaded with political significance: no one was able to bind (deō) the man, for he had broken his shackles many times; “there was no one strong (oudeis ischuen) enough to master him” (5:3f.). This exorcism is thus another key episode in Jesus-the-stronger-one's struggle to “bind the strong man.” In the synagogue exorcism he was identified with the scribal class, now with Caesar's armies.

The first trip is launched at the close of the first sermon, when Jesus invites his disciples to accompany him across the sea (4:35). Jesus is in the boat when the storm arises, unconcerned, and in a moment of high narrative pathos, the terrified disciples scream at their dozing leader, “Master, do you not care? We are dying!” (4:38, apollumetha). Unaware of the purpose of their journey, they betray their profound fear of abandonment, and Jesus silences this lack of faith as well as the storm itself (4:39f.).

- If the first journey was made under the “protection” of the present Jesus, in the second the disciples are compelled to make the crossing on their own. In fact, the episode begins on a note of tension: Mark tells us that Jesus “forced (ēnankasen) his disciples to embark in the boat ahead of him to the other side” (6:45). The destination is Bethsaida, which they will not reach on this trip, but on a subsequent one (8:22; below, 8,B,ii). Veterans of one dangerous crossing, the disciples appear to be reluctant to repeat the journey. Thrice the text stresses the spatial opposition between Jesus and the disciples (6:45–47): 1. he forces them to go on ahead while he dismisses the crowd; 2. he leaves them to go pray in the hills; 3. the boat was far out to sea while he was alone on the land.

- From a symbolic point of view, honor stands for a person's rightful place in society, his social standing. This honor place is marked off by boundaries consisting of power, sexual status, and position on the social ladder…. Honor is a claim to worth along with the social acknowledgment of worth.

A pig was slaughtered in front of us—a custom by which foreign visitors are given a grant of honor, or mana, in order that they may interact with their hosts. The next step in creating the environment for fellowship with the guest was the ceremonial drinking of kava—but this was restricted to the male representatives of each group. Finally came the “response” ritual, according to which the guests were to present gifts to the high chief, who symbolized the whole community. Needless to say, the younger, progressive urbanites from the Western delegations were nonplussed by all of this: queazy at the bloodletting, offended by the “sexism,” and embarrassed because they had brought no gifts!

- Jesus is approached by a member of the Jewish ruling class, who begs Jesus to heal his daughter. Jesus complies, setting out with the man, but is interrupted en route by the advances of an impure woman from the crowd. Against the inclinations of his disciples, Jesus attends to the poverty-stricken woman, but as a result arrives too late to save the daughter. The story's tragic end is surprisingly reversed by Jesus’ powerful deed of raising the young girl back to life. Mark again here uses the form of intercalation to interrelate these two episodes. They are also linked rhetorically by several elements, especially the number twelve: the woman has a flow of blood for twelve years, the daughter's age is twelve.

- Mark also portrays the two main characters in this episode as archetypical opposites in terms of economic status and honor. On the one hand, the synagogue ruler, Jairus (one of the rare named characters in Mark's story), makes an assertive approach to Jesus, as befits male social equals. This man was both “head” of his family (thus appealing on behalf of his daughter) and “head” of his social group (leader of the synagogue, archisunagōgōon). The man falls down at Jesus’ feet, a proper granting of honor prior to asking a favor. ([Location 5912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=5912))

- I would contend that the primary level of signification in this episode, however, lies in the fact that Jesus accepts the priority of the (“highly inappropriate”) importunity of this woman over the (“correct”) request of the synagogue leader. His mission to “lay his hands on” Jairus's daughter (5:23c) is interrupted by the “touch” of the doubly poor woman, and now she is the one who falls at the feet of Jesus (5:33). The most important symbolic reversal here is the status of the destitute woman. From the bottom of the honor scale she intrudes upon an important mission on behalf of the daughter of someone on the top of the honor scale—but by the story's conclusion, she herself has become the “daughter” at the center of the story! “My daughter,” proclaims Jesus, “Your faith has saved you, go in peace and be in full health, free of your scourge” (5:34).

- The setting this time is the faraway region around Tyre (eis ta horia Turou), representing the northernmost geographical penetration of Mark's narrative (see 3:8) and, socially speaking, quite beyond the horizons of the Palestinian Jew. According to the chronology of the story, Jesus has just engaged in a lengthy dispute with the Pharisees (7:1–23); the phrase “he entered a house and wanted no one to know it” (7:24) thus suggests that the intention of this trip across the Syrian border was to withdraw for reflection—not missionary work per se (Taylor, 1963:348). As each time before, however, the attempt at solitude fails; the interruption this time is by a gentile woman.

- In an intentional parallel to Jairus's request, the woman falls at Jesus’ feet to petition an exorcism in behalf of her daughter (7:25; cf. 5:22f.). The woman, Mark adds as if to make a point, is Greek, a Syro-Phoenician—in other words, a pagan. This is another Markan archetype, representative of the hellenized populations of the area. Unlike the approach of Jairus, her solicitation is an affront to the honor status of Jesus: no woman, and especially a gentile, unknown and unrelated to this Jew, would have dared invade his privacy at home to seek a favor.

- A rebuff by Jesus thus is not only understandable but expected; and indeed he appears to sharply thwart her advances by defending the collective honor of the Jews: “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right that the children's bread be thrown to the puppies” (7:27).

- The fact that the woman wishes to argue the point deepens her affront to Jesus, yet it is precisely her verbal riposte that gives the twist to this story: she argues that puppies might at least be entitled to the crumbs (7:28). Suddenly it is she who seeks to defend the “rights” of her people to the liberating power of Jesus’ exorcism ministry. Given the utterly shameful behavior and pagan character of the woman, it is shocking that Jesus concedes her the debate: “The demon has left your daughter” (7:29). Moreover, he grants her request, not because of her faith but because of her argument (dia touton ton logon); a remarkable turn of events, given Jesus’ powerful verbal mastery over his opponents in the Gospel! This drama represents another example of status-equalization. Jesus allows himself to be “shamed” (becoming “least”) in order to include this pagan woman in the new community of the kingdom; so too Judaism will have to suffer the indignity of redefining its group boundaries (collective honor) in order to realize that gentiles are now welcomed as equals.

- certain affinities with its counterparts in the Jewish cycle. She, like the hemorrhaging woman, demonstrates inappropriately assertive female behavior that is vindicated. The parallel with the Jairus story goes beyond the common petition on behalf of ailing daughters at home. Both these episodes articulate feeding-symbolics that are carefully correlated to Jesus’ feedings of the masses in the wilderness. Jesus’ somewhat anticlimactic instructions in the aftermath of his dramatic raising of Jairus's daughter were for those present to “give her something to eat” (5:43, dothēnai autē phagein). In like fashion, Jesus instructs his disciples in the first feeding to “give the crowd something to eat” (6:37, dote autois humeis phagein). Similarly, Jesus tells the gentile woman that “the children must first be satisfied” (7:27 chortasthēnai)—which satisfaction has indeed already been reported in 6:42 (“they all ate and were satisfied,” ephagon pantes kai echortasthēsan)! This is how Mark prepares the way for the fulfillment of the Syrophoenician woman's request—the feeding and satisfaction of the gentiles—which will indeed shortly take place (same verb, 8:4,8).

- Jesus encounters there a man unable to communicate verbally (7:32). He is brought by an unknown “they,” who beg Jesus to lay his hands upon him. This healing too contains elements in common with the story of Jairus's daughter: the healing is done away from the crowds, and only here in Mark does Jesus utter a special Aramaic phrase in the process (7:34; cf. 5:41). Here, however, the purity code is again sideswiped, for Mark tells us that Jesus “spat” on his fingers to effect the healing. D. Smith (1985) points out that saliva was considered as pollutive as was bodily excrement (see Lev 15:8). But—as in the case of the Jewish leper in 1:40ff.—the contagion is reversed, and the gentile healed.

- The first feeding story opens upon the return of the disciples from their mission (6:30). Jesus instructs his disciples to withdraw to the wilderness for reflection, as is his own practice (1:35), at which point Mark signals a transition with the pregnant comment that “many were coming and going and there was no time to eat” (6:31). The picture painted by Mark is full of pathos. Once again the community's escape from the continual press of ministry is frustrated by the crowds (6:32f.). Now even the wilderness is congested with those in need. Yet rather than responding in exasperation, Jesus demonstrates compassion (splagchnizomai, lit., having one's “guts” be torn apart), and he proceeds to teach them until the late hours (6:34).

- The exchange between Jesus and his disciples in 6:36–38 is the crux of the story. Apparently concerned about the welfare of the crowd, the disciples suggest that the people be allowed to leave so they can go to the surrounding (“circle,” cf. 6:6) farms and villages to buy themselves something to eat. Jesus responds bluntly and emphatically, “Give them something to eat yourselves” (dote autois humeis phagein). The disciples assume this means they are to spend their own money to buy food, a prospect that arouses their indignation. Taylor (1963:323) detects a “tone of astonishment, amounting to reproof” in their response (6:37), rendered by another translator the incredulous “Are we to buy bread to the tune of 200 denarius?” (Zerwick and Grosvenor, 1981:124). Jesus then urges them to go see how much bread they have (6:38). Fowler-rightly reminds us not to miss the irony here. The disciples have just returned from a mission for which they were instructed to carry neither bread nor money (6:8, see below, 7,A,ii). But they turn up with both!

- Twice the disciples suggest to Jesus that the solution to the hunger of the crowds is to “buy” food (6:36f.; the first appearance of agorazein in Mark). But Jesus’ solution has nothing to do with participation in the dominant economic order. Instead he determines the available resources, organizes the consumers into groups (6:39f.), pronounces the blessing (cf. 14:22), and distributes what is at hand (6:41). We should be clear that there is nothing “supernatural” reported to have transpired in this feeding of some five thousand men; only that “they all ate and were satisfied” (6:42).

- Mark is working with several images from the Hebrew scriptures here. The Exodus account of Yahweh's sustenance of Israel in the “wilderness” obviously comes to mind. But it is upon an episode in the Elisha miracle cycle that Mark's story is directly patterned (2 Kgs 4:42–44), in particular these lines: And Elisha said, “Give to the men, that they may eat” (LXX, dote tō laō kai esthietōsan). And his servant said, “How am I to set this before a hundred men?” So he repeated, “Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the Lord, ‘They shall eat (LXX, phagontai) and have some left.’ ” So he set it before them. And they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the Lord. This story is illuminating for two reasons. First, Elisha's successive food miracles take place in the context of “famine in the land” (2 Kgs 4:38), and thus are directly related to retarding the scourge of starvation. Secondly, the “bread” (LXX, artous) brought to Elisha represents… ([Location 6058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6058))

The “sheep without a shepherd” motif is seized upon by the prophets to criticize the leadership of Israel. Ezekiel 34 spins a parable around it that specifically condemns class stratification: “I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep” (Ez 34:20). The ruling class protects its privilege rather than the collective prosperity of the people, becoming predator instead of shepherd: Should not shepherds feed the sheep? You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the sheep…. With force and harshness you have ruled them.

- The disciples’ response (8:4) this time is not indignation but despair: in the wilderness (that is, outside the dominant social order and its markets) how can one possibly find the resources to feed the hungry?

The “leaven” of the Pharisees is articulated in the dispute over purity and kosher requirements, concrete barriers to the social experiment of integration in the new community (7:1–23).

- narrative—and a promise of “regeneration.” We pick up the story at 6:1, with Jesus’ visit to his home region. There he makes what will be his last public appearance in the symbolic space of a synagogue on the Sabbath (6:2). His neighbors are suspicious at his renown, questioning his wisdom and the “mighty works wrought by his hands” (6:2c, hai dunameis toiautai dia tōn cheirōn). To them Jesus is “the carpenter (6:3, tektōn), the son of Mary,” and from his hands more mundane things are expected. It may be that here the locals are accusing Jesus of economically abandoning his family (see 3:34f.), for if his mother is a widow, she would likely be dependent upon her oldest son. Only here do we learn anything of Jesus’ immediate family: a mother and brothers who are named and sisters who are not.

- There is no indication that Jesus’ “orders” (parēngeilen autois) are unique to this mission; they are for “the way” (eis hodon)—that is, paradigmatic of discipleship lifestyle (6:8). Their narrative significance lies not in some model of heroic asceticism (which would contradict Jesus’ ambivalence toward, e.g., fasting), but in the emphasis upon the utter dependence of the disciples upon hospitality. The “apostles” (so designated for the only time in Mark upon their return from the mission in 6:30) are allowed the means of travel (staff, sandals) but not sustenance (bread, money bag and money, extra clothes). In other words, they, like Jesus who has just been renounced in his own “home,” are to take on the status of a sojourner in the land. We might note that the “donning of sandals” as a Markan metaphor for discipleship (hupodedemenous sandalia; see above, 1:7) was missed by both Matthew (who forbids them, Mt 10:10) and Luke (who omits the reference, Lk 9:3).

Like modern guerillas, for example, Jesus’ disciples are subject to the social and political perceptions of the local populace, which will determine whether or not they will be “received”—always a good test of one's “popular base.” Unlike guerillas, however, who must “eat and run,” the Christian missionaries make no effort to be covert; where they are offered accommodation, they stay and establish a profile. And whereas a military-based movement will usually seize by force what is needed, at least in situations of acute need, Jesus forbids retaliation in the event of rejection.

- Jesus’ attack is twofold. He begins with a citation (with only minor changes to the LXX) of Isaiah 29:13, which not only specifically repudiates “human precepts” but (in light of Jesus’ teaching in 7:19) reiterates that the Pharisees are alienated from God's justice in their “hearts” (7:6f.; cf. 3:4). This carries Mark's use of the prophet in criticizing Jewish leaders to a new intensity, for the verse is part of an oracle in which Isaiah extends two themes upon which Mark has already drawn. The first is the blindness of the leaders (Is 29:9; cf. Mk 4:12). The second is their inability to “read” the word of God (Is 29:11f.; cf. Mk. 2:25; 12:10,26).

- The second part of the attack lies in the example chosen by Jesus to illustrate his objection, which seems at first tangential, but serves a deliberate purpose (7:10–13). The korban vow concerned a practice of consecrating or “willing” one's property and resources to the temple. Once this vow was made, personal assets belonged to the temple treasury and, though still in the hands of the owner, could not be used (see Josephus, War, II,ix,4). But Jesus describes a situation in which the “vow” becomes a “curse”: the traditional exercise of economic responsibility for one's parents according to the Torah (Ex 20:12; 21:17; Lv 20:9; Dt 5:16).

- The appeal to korban cements the link between Pharisees and scribes (7:1). The temple treasury (which in some literature of this period is referred to as korbanas) was to a significant degree dependent upon wills and vows for revenue. Later in the story Jesus confronts this temple treasury (12:37–44), at which time he lambastes the scribal class for hiding economic exploitation behind public piety—with the elderly again as the victim. Thus, despite the fact that the Pharisees actually differed with the scribal leaders on many points, Mark insists that insofar as the former upholds the temple as the symbolic center of Judaism, they are implicated with the latter in a political economy that oppresses the poor. By insisting that the local Pharisees are merely an extension of the long arm of the Jerusalem establishment, Mark undermines their credibility to his Galilean audience.

Significantly, it is only the Pharisees who “test” Jesus in the Gospel (again in 10:2 and with the Herodians in 12:15). This confirms the thesis that they represent a particular historical challenge to the Markan community. ([Location 6454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6454))

- The Pharisees demand a “sign from heaven” (8:11, sēmeion apo tou ouranou). An incensed Jesus (“sighing deeply”) steadfastly refuses to provide such signs to “this generation” (8:12, hē genea autē). This disavowal of miraculous spectacles will become absolutely crucial for a proper understanding of the “heavenly” portent that will be given to “this generation” in 8:38 (below, 8, D,ii). The notion of signs has positive value for the other evangelists, especially John. Luke considers “signs and wonders” as proof of divine anointing some nine times in Acts, and both he and Matthew produce the Q tradition of the “sign of Jonah” (Mt 12:39; 16:4; Lk 11:29). For Mark, however, signs are sought only by unbelievers, and are an unreliable indicator of the meaning of events (see 13:4,22). The only unhypocritical appeal to “heaven” (12:25) is to confirm the earthly practice of justice (6:41; 7:34; 10:21; 11:30f.).

- The term “leaven” (only here in Mark) obviously appears in relation to the metaphor of the “loaves,” a symbolic discourse Mark is setting up here. Mark is reminding the disciple/reader of the two main political forces in Galilee hostile to the kingdom project of reconciliation between Jew and gentile. On the one hand the Pharisaic party opposes integration on grounds of social boundary and purity, as we have just seen. On the other, the Herodiansponsored program of hellenization offers a style of “integration” based on cultural imperialism and collaboration with Rome. Those who resist such a program are disposed of, as in the case of John the Baptist (6:14ff.). Either “leaven” will destroy the delicate social experiment of the “one loaf.” ([Location 6482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6482))
- Beck correctly points out that the exegetical key to this passage is the distinction between the plural “loaves” (artous) and the singular “loaf” (arton); this is obscured by most translations, which use the one term “bread.” Literally the text reads: They had forgotten to bring loaves, and had none except for one loaf with them in the boat…. And they were discussing with one another the fact that they had no loaves. And Jesus perceived this, and said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no loaves?” [8:14, 16–17a].

As Kelber puts it, Jesus in 8:19f. “makes them repeat the symbolic numbers which should have tipped them off: twelve and seven” (1979:41).

- Mark was not unaware that hunger among masses was the result of structures of power and privilege. Hence he links purity issues to the political economy of the temple-based order in the korban debate (7:8–13). Jesus’ refusal (8:3) to allow the gentile masses to be sent away “fasting” reiterates Mark's suspicion of religious asceticism (2: 18ff.). He will repeatedly criticize the piety of the affluent when others hunger (10:17–22; 12:34,38ff.). Such attentiveness to concrete problems of deprivation adds weight to the argument that the Gospel was produced in an environment where the socio-economic disenfranchisement of the common people was a keenly felt problem. The narrative world of the text reflects a strong bias toward the rural poor, and a commitment to a redistribution of wealth.

- By making the sea his narrative center of gravity in the first half of the story, Mark was indeed reflecting the fact that the lake in fact lay at the heart of life in eastern Galilee. It determined the attractive climate of the region, enabling agriculture, tourism, and urban growth around its shores, as well as the all-important fishing industry; its fierce and sudden storms were also well known. His Palestinian audience was all too familiar with the omnipresence of dispossessed crowds, and above all the structures of segregation between Jew and gentile. In constructing his alternative order, Mark offers not fantasy but transformed reality. The kingdom was the laborious project to be undertaken by human disciples in the real world.

- to political conflict, it is never far off in the background. The Pharisees have emerged as the primary mouthpiece of Jewish officialdom in criticizing Jesus’ practice; there is every probability that this was in fact the case for Galilean Christians. Similarly, the Herodian nobility, with its base in the royal court at Tiberias, also had reason to be resented and feared by Mark's community. Though Jesus had been murdered in Jerusalem, John was the local martyr; the juxtaposing of his story with the Galilean missionary effort of the disciples strongly suggests that martyrdom was a continuing reality for Markan Christians. However caricatured these antagonists may appear in the Gospel, it is certain that they did historically represent the paramount opposition to any attempt to build a community in Galilee committed to integration and the preaching of repentance to the powerful.

In the next two sections of the story he sets about intensifying these two trajectories, as he begins to build toward his narrative climax. When the disciples arrive at Bethsaida in 8:22, the site of the boat is abandoned, and the second half of the story begins with a symbolic action of hope: the healing of a blind man. The community then embarks upon the boldest and most dangerous journey of all: the long march with Jesus to Jerusalem.

- We have arrived at the midpoint of the story. Once again, Mark's Jesus turns to challenge the disciples/reader. “Who do you say that I am?” (8:29a). This question is the fulcrum upon which the gospel narrative balances. Not only that: upon our answer hangs the character of Christianity in the world. Do we know who it is we are following, and what he is about? Mark began the story by telling us who Jesus is (1:1); the reader, like the Christian church, “knows the right answer” to this question. Thus we are shocked when Peter's answer, which is “correct,” is rejected by Jesus! With this “confessional crisis” Mark opens the second half of his Gospel.

- This is the “second prologue.” Like the first prologue, it begins “on the way” (8:27, cf. 1:2). The former articulated the “way through the wilderness”; now this is redefined as “the way to Jerusalem.” Thus this new journey is punctuated by a series of “portents” of Jesus’ political fate at the hands of the Jewish and Roman authorities. It is also the “way of the cross,” a specific kind of political and community practice that takes the disciples/reader into the deepest paradoxes of power. We are told that we cannot save our lives by preserving them, nor lose them by giving them up; that to be “last” is to be “first,” and to be “least” is to be “great.” ([Location 6664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6664))

- This second prologue is knitted into the second “construction” cycle, a catechism of dialogue and instruction concerning nonviolence as a way of life. Yet as this way becomes clearer, the disciples’ resistance to it increases, which Mark portrays with almost cartoonlike exaggeration.

- The overall construction of 8:22–10:52 is widely agreed upon, being one of the very first discoveries of redaction criticism (Schweizer, 1978). The section is framed by stories of blind men receiving sight (8:22–26; 10:46–52). Peter's “confession” in Caesarea-Philippi (8:27–30) introduces a triple cycle. Each cycle consists of Jesus’ prediction of his own political fate (portents), the disciples’ inability to recognize the implications of the way (“blindness”), and Jesus’ rejoinding instructions concerning the practice of nonviolence and servanthood, each stated in the form of a paradox. The cycles also plot a journey in three stages. The section is outlined in Table 3. The struggle launched by Peter's answer to Jesus’ question—the struggle over the meaning of messianic politics—is deepened in each of these cycles.

- The first cycle is composed in fundamental relationship to the confessional crisis; it stands at the structural center of the Gospel. Peter's “confession” is “corrected” by the first portent, which is then followed by the second call to discipleship. The way of the cross is then underscored by the two dramatic-symbolic actions that follow. The transfiguration is the second of the Gospel's three “apocalyptic moments,” and like the baptism is a legitimating device meant to resituate the story around the new theme. Here the heavenly voice again invades the narrative to lend divine credibility to the apparently incredible proposition that the only way to save one's life is to lose it. After a brief “interpretive sequel” to the transfiguration, in which its meaning is pondered, comes the second symbolic episode. The healing of the deaf-mute boy, Jesus’ final exorcism, functions as a symbolic reproduction and resolution of the disciples’ struggle to believe.

- The second half of the Gospel abruptly abandons the narrative sites of sea, boat, and wilderness. The journey across the waters now becomes a journey from the margins of Palestine to its center. Beginning in the extreme north of Mark's “world” (Caesarea-Philippi), Jesus slowly winds his way south, back down through Galilee (making one last stop at the former narrative center of Capernaum, 9:33), and on into Judea (10:1). It is not until the third cycle, however, that Mark reveals to us the destination of this new way: Jerusalem (10:32). The section closes in narrative movement toward the great city, “as they were leaving Jericho” (10:45). ([Location 6709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6709))

- The confessional crisis brings into the foreground a third plot crisis, previously only implicit: the struggle over Jesus’ identity. Peter identifies Jesus as “Messiah,” but each of Jesus’ three “death portents” argue that this Messiah—whom Mark renames the “Human One”—is not what the audience expects. Instead of coming to fight alongside the traditional political leadership to reestablish the ancien régime of David over against the Romans, the Human One will actually be murdered by a political coalition of Jewish and Roman authority. The confessional crisis (“Who do you say I am?”) in other words is straightaway eclipsed by a crisis of political practice (What is genuinely revolutionary leadership?).

- By the end of the first half of the story we were compelled to conclude that the disciples, because of their lack of comprehension, had been demoted to a status previously reserved for “outsiders” and opponents of Jesus. With the reproach of 8:18, the blindness/deafness theme had captured center stage. I contended that this was a crisis not only of plot but also of reading: Are we also blind? The confessional debacle will further undermine our readerly confidence: the “correct” answer is repudiated. The story is beginning to seem locked in a downward spiral of contradiction and tragedy. Against this discourse of incomprehension stands a counter-discourse, represented by four episodes in which Jesus heals blind or deaf persons: healing of deaf and dumb man, 7:31–37 healing of blind man, 8:22–26 exorcism of deaf and dumb spirit, 9:14–29 healing of blind man, 10:45–52 This series, the final four healing episodes in Mark's Gospel, also narratively bridges the first and second half of the story. An unmistakable counterpoint of hope, this discourse culminates in the healing of Bartimaeus—a discipleship story (10:46–52). ([Location 6733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6733))
- Still, the healings do not formally resolve the plot crisis of incomprehension—the discipleship narrative will yet collapse altogether. Rather, they function to encourage the reader to continue; they represent a discourse of hope even as the story-scape grows more ominous. As such, they prepare narrative space for the other new theme introduced in this section along with the portents: the promise of resurrection (8:3lb; 9:9, 3lb; 10:34c). This is stated symbolically (as in 5:41) in the “raising to life” of the demon-oppressed boy who was “dead” in 9:26f. The disciples of course understand the meaning of neither cross (9:32) nor resurrection (9:10). Nevertheless, this counterdiscourse firmly extends hope to the reader: the blind and deaf can be healed. The “lifeline” of promise that keeps the narrative open when it threatens closure is an important aspect of Mark's literary strategy in the second half of the Gospel, and prepares us for its surprising and baffling conclusion. ([Location 6751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6751))
- At the ideological level, Mark adopts the theme of healing the deaf and blind from Isaiah, who uses it as a symbol of the messianic age. A sampling of this pervasive motif includes: 1. In that day, the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see (Is 29:18); 2. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped (35:5); 3. Bring forth those who are blind, yet have eyes; who are deaf, yet have ears! (43:8). Thus this “fiction” also functions intertextually to confirm that the new order has dawned. ([Location 6758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=6758))

- this healing represents a kind of “first stage” of Jesus’ project of eradicating blindness. Jesus’ healing touch is only partially successful, and the man requires a second in order to “see plainly” (8:25). E. S.

Peter's identification of Jesus may be in one sense “correct,” but he does not “see” its meaning clearly; hence there is at Bethsaida no discipleship motif involved.

- According to the understanding of Peter, “Messiah” necessarily means royal triumph and the restoration of Israel's collective honor. Against this, Jesus argues that “Human One” necessarily means suffering. This is so because, as the advocate of true justice, the Human One as critic of the debt code and the Sabbath necessarily comes into conflict with the “elders and chief priests and scribes” (8:31). In other words, this is not the discourse of fate or fatalism, but of political inevitability.

To prevent defection in combat the promise of immortality was given to those who might die nobly, whereas cowardly attempts to preserve life by fleeing would mean certain death at the hands of the enemy. But Mark is not goading the disciples to military heroism; he is introducing the central paradox of the Gospel.

- In the story world of Mark, the “relations of power” in the myth appear to be reversed. It is the Human One in 8:31 who, in his inevitable conflict with the powers, becomes a defendant in their court, where he is tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. In this sense, Mark's Human One has more affinity with the persecuted saints of Daniel. But in the saying of 8:38f., the Human One again appears as true judge, who comes “with the angels” (the “saints of the Most High” in Daniel) to receive the kingdom. In all of this, Mark has reproduced the “bifurcation” of reality effected by Daniel's myth. In Daniel, the prophet “sees” (Dn 7:2) oppressive rulers who appear to be prevailing in the historical moment. But if the prophet looks more deeply (“as I looked again,” Dn 7:9), he sees the Human One establishing justice. Thus in Mark, the Human One represents at once both defendant and prosecutor—depending upon which court, “earthly” or “heavenly,” is being considered.

- So too with Mark's Human One; what appears to be his defeat and the triumph of both Rome and the Sanhedrin (narrated in his trial and execution) will really be his vindication and their judgment. This mythic discourse functions to help us interpret the outcome of the story; it gives us “eyes to see” the apocalyptic moment of the cross as the “glory of the Human One.” But more important still is the way in which the myth instructs us in our real, historical choices between these two competing “authorities” and their respective “courtrooms.” The disciples/reader must choose which “reality” we will trust: to be vindicated in the “Danielic” courtroom is to be condemned in the Jewish/Roman one, and vice versa. We either stand with Jesus, deny ourself and lose our lives “for his sake and the gospel's” (8:34f.), or we stand “ashamed” before him and the angels (those who have stood with him; 8:38f.).

- awe of this spectacle, once again Peter speaks for the group. But he has changed his tune: he addresses Jesus here not as “Messiah,” but “Rabbi” (9:5). At the two later points in Mark's story in which “Rabbi” occurs, the disciples are standing with the dominant Jewish ideology over against Jesus: (1) their lament over Jesus’ repudiation of the temple (11:21), and (2) Judas's greeting even as he betrays Jesus to the high priests (14:45). Is this also such a moment? It seems so, for again instead of understanding the way of the cross Peter proposes a cult of adulation. He offers to construct a memorial, “a temporary dwelling place like the ‘booths’ made of interlacing branches at the Feast of Tabernacles (Lv 23:4ff.)” (Taylor, 1963: 391). For the second time in as many episodes Peter has misconstrued the discourse of Jesus! And, for a second time, the lead disciple is rebuked.

What does 9:9f. really say? 1. he warned them (diasteilato) not to proclaim (diēgēsōntai) what they had seen; 2. until the Human One should rise from the dead; 3. and they held fast (ekratēsan) to the word 4. while they discussed among themselves what “to rise from the dead” meant.

As already established in this section, it is Jesus’ teaching of the cross: “He preached the word to them openly” (8:32). “If anyone is ashamed of me and my words” (8:28)….

Significantly, they are reluctant to ask him what he “means” by resurrection, but probably assume, like modern imperial hermeneutics, that it does indeed have to do with eschatological triumphalism (as later indicated by their response in 10:37). Hence they inquire about an alleged scribal assertion that, according to the “eschatological timetable,” Elijah “must… ([Location 7073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7073))
- There is ongoing scholarly debate about the degree to which the Elijah-as-forerunner myth characterized popular messianic expectation among Jews in the first century (see Horsley and Hanson, 1985:149).2 Whatever the evidence from extrabiblical sources, this text suggests that the tradition of Malachi 4:5f. was in fact invoked by some as assurance that “restoration” (9:12; apokatistanei; see Oepke, TDNT I:388) would precede “judgment.” It is this notion that Mark attributes to the scribes, consistent with his ideological portrait of them: they are sanguine about the “end time” because according to the promise of Malachi 4:5, Elijah “must come” (… ([Location 7078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7078))
- Once again it is the war of myths: triumphalist eschatological “necessity” vs. Jesus’ political “inevitability.” What if, argues Mark's Jesus, Elijah has come, and the ruling classes not only ignored him but murdered him? This was precisely the meaning of Mark's appeal to Malachi 3:1 at the outset of his story: John the Baptist was Elijah, preaching repentance in order to “turn the hearts” of the people. The “necessity” of biblical radicalism (“as it is written”) is that prophets are neither welcomed nor heeded, but killed. Hence the discourse of Mark's alternative interpretation in 9:12f.: Ahow is it written about the Human One Bthat he will suffer many things and be repudiated Cbut I say to you Elijah has come B′and they did to him what they wished A′as it is written of him. The concentric structure recapitulates the discourse of 6:14ff., which stated that Jesus is the “successor” to John in the political vocation of witness to the powers (above, 7,B,ii). This is now restated, this time using the “intertextual pseudonyms” of each: the Human One is the successor to Elijah. Once again, then, a question of eschatology is referred back to the cross. The link with the Elijah myth also further confirms my thesis that the advent of the Human One will be identified with the execution of Jesus. For contrary to expectations, “Elijah's advent” occurred not as an eschatological spectacle, but as the political ministry of John, resulting in his trial and execution. Mark is telling us to expect the “advent” of the Human One in exactly the same fashion. This collapsing of… ([Location 7085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7085))

- To understand this episode as symbolic action let us begin by tracing the rhetorical connection between faith and power in Mark. The logic runs as follows. The disciples have been given the power to exorcise demons (6:12), but this seems here to have failed them.

- But how, then, will the disciples be able to cast out this demon (9:28)? Only, says Jesus, through prayer. And what is prayer? When Jesus next returns to this subject (11:23f.), he will explicitly connect prayer to “the power of belief.” To pray is to learn to believe in a transformation of self and world, which seems, empirically, impossible—as in “moving mountains” (11:23). What is unbelief but the despair, dictated by the dominant powers, that nothing can really change, a despair that renders revolutionary vision and practice impotent. The disciples are instructed to battle this impotence, this temptation to resignation, through prayer. “Keep awake and pray, that you may not succumb to temptation!,” Jesus later will urge them (14:38).

(The motifs of “fire” and “water,” 9:22, will appear again in the next section in reference to apostasy.) Is not prayer the intensely personal struggle within each disciple, and among us collectively, to resist the despair and distractions that cause us to practice unbelief, to abandon or avoid the way of Jesus? And has not this demon, so embedded in our imperial culture, not kept us impotent, docile subjects of the status quo “since childhood” (9:21)?

Not only is Jesus willing to endorse the redemptive practice of “outsiders,” but also the simplest act of hospitality (“a cup of water”) shown to anyone “who bears the name of Messiah.” John is worried about those with competing power, but Jesus is welcoming all those who do the works of mercy and justice.

The background of this idea probably lies in the sharing of salt in a meal (Ezr 4:14). To share salt with someone is to share fellowship with him, to be in covenant with him. The discourse began with two situations of conflict and strife, the self-seeking arguing of the disciples about rank and the conflict with the strange exorcist.

Although it has been implied in the portents that Jerusalem is the goal of this long march, Mark will not explicitly reveal this destination until 10:32. The double use of “again” (palin) in 10:1, the reappearance of the crowds (only here in the plural in Mark), and the phrase “he taught them as he was accustomed” are stage directions meant to recall the first half of the story and prepare us for a conflict episode.

- In 9:37 Mark constructed a kind of syllogistic argument based upon the notion of “receiving” (dechetai): “Whoever receives one such as this in my name, receives me; whoever receives me receives not me but the one who sent me.” In order to understand the earnestness of this equation, the reader is supposed to recall the disciples, who were themselves “sent” on mission (6:11). There they were vulnerable, dependent upon being “received” in hospitality—in a sense, they were “as children.” The warning issued there was: “Whatever place does not receive you or hear you, shake off the dust…as a witness against them.” Now the child threatens to become “a witness against” those disciples who refuse to accept the social transformation of which Jesus spoke in 9:35. Thus in 10:15, the circle of references closes and the syllogism is extended: “Whoever does not receive the kingdom like a child, will not enter into it at all!” ([Location 7397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7397))

The “war of myths” rages even at the heart of the community: Jesus is committed to inclusivity, his disciples to exclusivity. Jesus’ solemn pronouncement thus turns this seemingly minor skirmish into nothing less than a watershed challenge about participation in the kingdom (10:15)!

- Why should not the child represent an actual class of exploited persons, as does every other subject of Jesus’ advocacy in Mark? The impure and the poor and the gentile are representations of real social marginalization; Why not also the child? This would certainly be more in keeping with the ideology of this catechism, which is concerned to unmask the realities of domination within community and even within kindred relationships. Indeed, from the narrative world of Mark we have cause to suspect that all is not well for the child in first-century Palestinian society. For where do we meet children in the Gospel? In every case, it is in situations of sickness or oppression: the synagogue ruler's daughter (5:21ff.), the Syrophoenician's daughter (7:24ff.), the deaf and dumb son (9:14ff.).

- Via cannot see this because, like every other commentator, he idealizes childhood, referring to it as the site of “secure origins.” But what if this is a romantic illusion? What if the “site” of the child, vulnerable, credulous, and dependent, is in fact the very beginning point in the spiral of both exploitation and violence? Could it be that the discourse of Mark is arguing that if we are to forge a nonviolent way of life, we must weed out the structures and practices of violence at their roots? That the validity of nonviolence must pertain to the most basic building block of human social existence: the family?

- “The love a child has for his or her parents ensures that their conscious or unconscious acts of mental cruelty will go undetected…. Their tolerance for their parents knows no bounds” (1983:4). Children cannot have critical awareness of manipulation by adults, nor can they react to it: Adults are free to hurl reproaches at God, at fate, at the authorities or at society if they are deceived, ignored, punished unjustly, confronted with excessive demands, or lied to. Children are not allowed to reproach their gods—their parents and teachers. By no means are they allowed to express their frustrations. Instead, they must repress or deny their emotional reactions which build up inside until adulthood, when they are finally discharged, but not on the object that caused them [1983:254].

- this exercise of power by the adult over the child goes largely unchecked in the wider social system: the family is “private domain.” The subjection of the child thus represents the basic building block of socialization into wider socio-political structures of domination. According to Miller, the “silent drama” of children consists of the following stages: 1. to be hurt/dominated as a young child without anyone knowing; 2. to be unable to react to or process resultant anger; 3. to internalize the sense of betrayal by rationalizing or idealizing the parent's “good intentions”; 4.… ([Location 7457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7457))

Of particular interest to Miller, a Swiss of the generation that remembers Hitler, is how so many otherwise intelligent and critical persons can readily submit to authoritarianism: When a man comes along and talks like one's own father and acts like him, even adults will forget their democratic rights or will not make use of them.

- It follows also that nonviolence, as a part of a radical practice that seeks to address structural injustice at its roots, must begin with the family system.

- A new social order cannot be constructed unless and until we have dealt with the very foundations of oppression: “It is part of the tragic nature of the repetition compulsion that someone who hopes eventually to find a better world than the one he or she experienced as a child in fact keeps creating instead the same undesired state of affairs” (ibid.:241).

- it is worth noting that Mark's discourse here is not a “command.” The central syllogism of this section understands liberation as a matter of invitation: Whoever receives the child receives me, and whoever receives me receives…the one who sent me (9:37); whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child cannot enter it (10:15). Here is the promise of a new family system based upon both access and acceptance. ([Location 7495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7495))
- I am convinced, however, that Miller's thesis gives us “ears to hear” the radical teaching of Jesus at this point in a way that the traditional, idealizing exegesis does not.

Isaiah's suffering servant and the lowly Human One was not what Peter had in mind when he confessed “Messiah” at the beginning of this section. But it is the only Messiah Mark proclaims.

- All three have everything to do with the subjugation of women by men. Against this, Mark has argued that women should have equal rights in the marriage contract; later he will again defend women against patriarchal ideology (12:18ff.). At this point we need to consider the fact that married couples are wholly absent from the stage of Mark's story, with only two minor exceptions (one is Jairus and his wife, 5:40, the other is the illegitimate union of Herod, 6:17f.!). More to the point, women otherwise always appear without husbands! Because the patriarchal system considered women as second-class citizens, and unmarried women as third-class citizens, this is truly a subversive narrative strategy. What could be its social signification? ([Location 7719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7719))

- He goes out of his way to discredit the (male) disciples in this section, especially regarding their aspirations to leadership and power (9:34; 10:35ff.). In contrast, Jesus advocates and embodies a vocation of leadership predicated upon an ideology of “service.” As I have pointed out, only women fulfill the vocation of diakonia in Mark, from the beginning of the story (1:31) to its end (15:41). The disparity between Mark's portrait of male and female disciples will be intensified in his conclusion: whereas the men desert Jesus at the very point at which their following becomes politically risky, the women stay with him to the cross and after. It is they, therefore, who will be witnesses to the resurrection (below, 13,C,iii, ([Location 7725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7725))

- This would help to explain the appearance of “independent” women in the Gospel. It is not that Mark rejects the vocation of marriage, just as he does not reject the vocation of leadership. However, he understands that the whole social system of patriarchy, which renders tyrants strong in the world and women subject in the home, must be overturned. The first concrete step in the “last as first” revolution is to bring women into leadership, and in order to do that the rigid definitions of their proper social roles (as wives and child-bearers only) must be itself undermined. This is what Mark's story does. ([Location 7744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7744))

- This is the last healing in the “blind/deaf” series and the Gospel as a whole. Unlike the Bethsaida episode, this symbolic statement is decisive; it is well known as a paradigmatic story of discipleship (Achtemeier, 1978). Often ignored, however, are its social and political dimensions. It is Bartimaeus who introduces the title “Jesus, son of David” (10:47), further preparing us for the imminent struggle over the ideology of popular kingship. There is also an implied class contrast between the discipleship of Bartimaeus and the nondiscipleship of the rich man, just as there was between the hemorraghing woman and the synagogue ruler in 5:21ff. These stories exhibit several common characteristics (Johnson, 1978a): 1. the hindering role of the crowd (cf. 10:48 with 5:31); 2. the commendation of faith, in both cases, hēpistis sou sesōken se (cf. 5:34 with 10:52); 3. ritual impurity; the bleeding woman and Bartimaeus, whose name in Hebrew could mean “son of the unclean.” ([Location 7755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=7755))

- Bartimaeus, like the rich man, encounters Jesus “on the way” (10:17 46).

- Mark draws a devastating contrast between this beggar's initiative and the aspirations of the disciples. Upon their approach, Jesus had asked James and John, “What do you want me to do for you?” (10:36). To the beggar's petition, Jesus responds with exactly the same words. But how different the requests! The disciples wished for status and privilege; the beggar simply for his “vision.” The one Jesus cannot grant, the other he can. It is Bartimaeus who is told to “take courage” (tharsei), as the disciples were told earlier, during their dangerous crossing of the sea (6:50). And it is the beggar who follows.

- These conflicting narrative signals have a very clear purpose: to put the reader into a state of uncertainty, and hence ambivalence, about Peter's confession. The privileged information we as readers have possessed since the outset (1:1,11) about Jesus has been cast into doubt. Indeed, at no point in the story will any “confession” be unambiguous, including the centurion's cry as Jesus hangs dead on a Roman cross (15:39). The place of confession in Mark is usurped altogether by the call to discipleship, and this at the dead center of the story.

- For in identifying his movement as a necessarily subversive one, the fact remains that he calls his followers to take up the cross, not the sword. The way of nonviolence reckons with execution, not dreams of Maccabean heroism and revolutionary conquest: in nonviolence, said Gandhi, “bravery consists in dying, not in killing” (1948:1, 265). But Mark's cross does not represent only the consequence of subversive practice, as liberation theology has contended. It is a deliberate revolutionary strategy, embraced in the conviction that only nonviolence can break the most primal structures of power and domination in the world, and create the possibility for a new order to dawn in the world. This proposition overturns all traditional notions of political efficacy, social power, and economic security. And truly it is the one that followers of Jesus (both in the story and throughout Christian history) have found most difficult to accept.

This includes every form of relationship, from the systemic to the interpersonal, in order to address fundamental social and economic patterns of domination at their roots.

- The procession itself indeed recalls the military entry of the triumphant rebel leader Simon Maccabaeus into Jerusalem “with praise and palm branches…and with hymns and songs” (1 Mc 13:51). We must further consider Josephus's account of the Sicarius leader Menahem, who during the first months of the revolt, led a kingly procession into Jerusalem. Even as the insurgents were still fighting to capture the temple mount, Josephus writes: [Menahem] took some of the men of note with him, and retired to Masada, where he broke open king Herod's armory, and gave arms not only to his own people, but to other robbers also.

- Well over half of the episode concerns the instructions given by Jesus to “two disciples” in preparation for the procession (11:1–7).

- This procession is the opening round of the struggle over the character of messianic politics. The cries articulate the prevailing orthodoxy, which presumes the rehabilitation of the temple state in the “kingdom of our Father David.” At this stage Mark does not directly repudiate this enthusiasm, but does so indirectly, as in the Prologue, through the vehicle of narrative anticlimax. Jesus does not actually enter the city until after the procession, and moreover his “epiphany” in the temple is not the dramatic intervention envisioned by popular messianic expectation. Jesus merely enters the temple, looks around, and withdraws back to Bethany (11:11).

- In fact, commercial activity was an entirely normal aspect of any cult in antiquity.

- “Those selling doves” refers to the staple temple commodity relied upon by the poor. Doves were used primarily “for the purification of women (Lv 12:6, Lk 2:22–24), the cleansing of lepers (Lv 14:22) and other purposes (Lv 15:14,29)” (Taylor, 1963:462). That there was an awareness of the fact that cultic obligations were especially hard on the poor is indicated by this interesting rabbinic case cited by Jeremias: We have evidence of an indirect attempt at maximum price fixing by Simeon, son of Gamaliel I (Paul's teacher, Acts 22:3), whom we meet as an influential member of the Sanhedrin at the time of the Jewish war. Once a pair of doves…was sold for two gold dinars.

- Jesus, as he will throughout the Jerusalem campaign, resorts to a defense/offense based upon scripture. Instead of returning to the Hosea text, however, Mark cites the two great prophets, Isaiah and Jeremiah. His first audience would immediately have understood his intertextual argument; modern readers must return to the citations if we are to understand the point. The first quote is directly from the LXX text of Isaiah 56:7, the climax to an oracle that is perhaps the fullest Old Testament vision of an inclusive Israel. The opening hymn of a collection modern scholars call “Third Isaiah,” Isaiah 56:1–8 narrates Yahweh's promise to the foreigner and the socially marginal (56:3,6). The “house of prayer” on the “holy mountain” (56:7) will be a place of joy for all who are dispossessed: “Thus says the Lord God, who gathers the outcasts of Israel: I will gather yet others to him besides those already gathered” (Is 56:8). By citing this tradition Mark has indicated what the temple is supposed to embody: inclusivity and community, especially accessible to “outsiders.” But to explain what it has in fact become (“but you have made it”), however, Mark draws upon another, quite different tradition. Many have argued that the reference here to “thieves” (lēstōn) is meant to suggest the social bandits (as it does in 14:48 and 15:27), and hence should be seen as… ([Location 8231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=8231))

- In 11:19–21, Jesus leaves the temple in the evening; back outside Jerusalem, Mark returns briefly to the fig tree story. Mark's own conflation of the temple action and the fig tree curse instructs us to use both the Malachi and Hosea traditions as the hermeneutical keys. The “whole nation” is implicated in “robbing” Yahweh through the corruption of the temple sacrifice and tithing system (Mal 3:9), which makes the “disobedient princes” rich (Hos 9:15). Israel is challenged to repent—that is, to restore economic justice—in order to receive “blessing” (Mal 3:10–12). If it does not, Yahweh will “send Elijah the prophet” to issue one last call to repentance, “lest I come and smite the land with a curse” (Mal 4:5f.). It is this curse that has been enacted; Ephraim has “borne no fruit,” and “dried up to the roots” (Hos 9:16). The curse/exorcism of the fig tree/temple is more than a political protest; Mark means for it to be a “proleptic” sign within his own narrative.

It is a most appropriate place to deliver a mini sermon on faith. “Believe in God!” is not the hortatory platitude it may at first glance seem (11:23). The modern reader must remember that in the social world of the first-century Middle East, a temple was closely identified with a deity's existence. This was supremely true for the Jew; one could not simply repudiate the temple without provoking the most fundamental crisis regarding Yahweh's presence in the world.

In a legal context, the term “uprooter of mountains” was found to have a technical meaning. Applied to the king (and to Herod in particular), it could be employed as a double entendre, bolstering a legal argument for the exceptional nature of Herod's pulling down of the Temple….

- However, because most translations include 11:25, I will consider it part of the Markan narrative. The literary fabric is sound, since the theme of prayer was already introduced in the Isaiah citation of 11:17. The ideology is also appropriate to the context, for the connection between prayer and temple piety/profiteering is fundamental to Mark's criticism of the cult; he will return to it later in a biting satire on the practice of prayer by the ruling class (12:39f.). But most of all, the new practice of forgiveness is the necessary alternative to the temple cult. ([Location 8323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N92F9TR&location=8323))

The community's practice of forgiveness becomes the replacement of the redemptive/symbolic system of debt represented in the temple.

Jesus is approached by political opponents; 2. they challenge him with a question concerning authority; 3. Jesus poses a counterquestion, challenging his opponents to state their own loyalties; 4. opponents respond; 5. Jesus answers original question accordingly.

Furthermore, the Sanhedrin was at that time the first communal court of justice in the province, and finally it was the highest Jewish court of law in all Judea [1969:74].

- In his counterquestion, Jesus exposes this opposition (legitimation “from heaven”/“from men,” 11:29f.) by taking the example of the baptizing ministry of John. According to Mark, John's was a ministry of considerable power, which Jesus inherited even more powerfully “after John was arrested” (1:7–15). Hence, what the leaders think of John will determine what they think of Jesus. Inasmuch as John was killed by political authorities who were threatened by his preaching of repentance, the question is a loaded one, and the answer moot. Jesus maintains that prophetic action is sanctioned either from “outside” or from “within” the present social order; inasmuch as the Sanhedrin has not granted Jesus authority, it must come from God. Realizing that Jesus has politically outflanked them, the leaders “equivocate” (dielogizonto, 11:31), a word Mark always uses to describe ideological confusion (2:6,8; 8:16f.; 9:33).

- In conclusion to the parable Jesus again turns to scripture for legitimation, citing verbatim the LXX of Psalm 118:22 (12:10f.). Mark has now brought Psalm 118 into the center of the messianic war of myths. Most rabbinic literature interpreted David as the “rejected one” (apedokimasan) of the Psalm. But God restored David as king; thus the crowd acclaims Jesus as restorer of this promise (11:9f.). But Mark (with the rest of early Christian tradition, for this text is one of the most often quoted in the New Testament) expropriates this identification for Jesus. It is Jesus who will be “rejected” by the leaders of Judea (8:31), thus subverting the ideology of restoration of the independent temple state.

Why is this challenge put on the lips of the Pharisaic-Herodian coalition? This coalition already exists on the Markan narrative map—we met it in 3:6, where the two groups held a “political consultation” to see about prospects for the murder of Jesus, on the heels of the summary confrontation in the Galilee synagogue. In Mark's world (both narrative and historical), the Pharisees are Jesus’ most dogged Galilean opponents, and the “Herodians” represent the “royalists,” whose murderousness was dramatized in the story of the execution of John the Baptist (6:17–29).

- The weight of the imperial tribute had been felt since the time of Herod: [Who] bled the populace poor with taxes…. The tribute exacted by Rome was large in itself. Herod's revenues were huge, used primarily to maintain his own court and military troops as well as to support his extensive, luxurious building programs. Taxes were so high that twice Herod was able to remit sizable portions of the payment when he wished to ingratiate himself with the people…. Many popular outbursts occurred after Herod's death (4 B.C.E.). Masses in Jerusalem demanded reduction of taxes, abolition of duties, liberation of prisoners [Rhoads, 1976:24f.]. Taxation was a central issue in the brief rebellion at the time Judea first came under direct Roman administration in 6 C.E., as indicated in this passage from Josephus: The territory of Archelaus was now reduced to a province, and Coponius, a Roman of the equestrian order, was sent out as procurator, entrusted by Augustus with full powers, including the infliction of capital punishment. Under his administration, a Galilaean, named Judas, incited his countrymen to revolt, upbraiding them as cowards for consenting to pay tribute to the Romans and tolerating mortal masters, after having God for their Lord [War, II,viii,1]. Throughout the decades the burden of the tribute, born wholly by the peasantry, was a major cause of social banditry in the countryside; failure to meet the tribute demand often resulted in expropriation of the land of small holders (see Horsley and Hanson, 1985:52ff.). There is reason to believe that as hostilities grew and polarization deepened in colonial Palestine, the degree of conscientization concerning the tax question as indicative of the political economy of colonial domination also increased. Things worsened immediately before the revolt, as imperial taxes were raised and economic corruption increased under the procuratorship of Albinus (C.E. 62–64; War, II,xiv,1). At the time of the breach with Rome in Jerusalem, there was apparently a backlog of imperial taxes to pay; the revolt solved this problem by stopping the tribute. During the revolt, we know that a series of coins for “liberated” Jerusalem were minted and circulated throughout Palestine.

Whichever side Jesus takes will facilitate his downfall: if he refuses to endorse tribute payment, the colonial government can move against him; if he cooperates, he stands to lose the very popular support that is protecting him from the Jewish leaders. This was exactly analogous to the dilemma facing Mark's community. From the standpoint of the political polarization of wartime, the tax question was one of the ways in which they were being pressured to declare their partisanship vis-à-vis the revolt. But the discourse of these three episodes strongly reasserts the ideology of “nonalignment,” a rejection of both the Roman colonial presence and the revolt.
