### within the English Empire, burgeoning colonial commerce properly channeled could increase the empire’s economic pie. That was the benefit of “free trade,” in the original meaning of that term: free trade within the empire. Within a well-ordered imperial political economy, everyone might gain from trade, even if the home country enjoyed the positive balance.

### The Board of Trade—administrative inheritor of Shaftesbury’s Council for Trade and Plantations—was established in 1696. Locke was a member. By now, nearly two-thirds of English revenue came from taxes and duties on overseas trade, funding a powerful English fiscal-military state erected on the basis of wealth-generating commerce.

### There was, however, a final coda to the political-economic debates of the long Revolution. After the War of 1812, the Democratic-Republicans decided Hamilton had been right: a National Bank was both necessary and proper. On April 10, 1816, President Madison signed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States.

### Another result was the emergence of a distinctively American, anti-elitist, proto-populist, and pro-commercial politics of “antimonopoly.” Antimonopoly required equality of commercial opportunity and therefore prohibitions on “corrupt” government patronage and favoritism. Dramatically, Jackson killed off the BUS. In individual states, the Democracy led a social movement for democratic “open access” to incorporation. Corporations, long subsovereigns, began to shed their public status, migrating into the…

### The chief cause of the expansion of money and credit in this period was that U.S. hard-currency reserves had increased, backing the multiplying banknote issues. In particular, silver mined in Mexico had swelled U.S. hard-currency reserves. Due to the British opium trade in Asia, this silver no longer flowed to China to finance Anglo-American transactions. It stayed in the United States, backing further domestic credit issues.90 In all this, however, the financial flywheel was the Bank of England.

### Brazil and Cuba had domestic slave markets, but nowhere else in the Americas was there an interregional slave market like in the United States. Professional slave traders visited southern plantations and oversaw city slave markets, the largest being in New Orleans, where slaves on the auction block were poked, prodded, and examined.

### The aftermath of the Panic of 1837 was the next decisive economic event. Suffering from debt-deflation, many masters decided to make their plantations more economically self-sufficient and to rely less on commercial markets for foodstuffs. They would still rely on market demand for cotton, but would rely less on markets for the supply of some plantation necessities. The full-fledged U.S. “cotton and corn” system arose—distinct from the older, more cash-crop-oriented West Indian model—in which masters put sufficient acreage into corn to meet the plantation’s basic subsistence needs. This new “safety first” strategy was thus a check on commercial risk.

### President Lincoln was determined to end slavery’s geopolitical extension across space, that dominant theme of the Age of Commerce which, as we have seen, lay at the heart of the political-economic settlement of the Empire of Liberty. Moreover his proclamation that the United States could not forever exist half slave and half free meant that the Empire of Liberty was no more. Republican secretary of state William Seward glimpsed instead “the expansion of the empire of free white men”—an empire of free soil and free labor.

### But “what European miners had done over the span of several centuries, the Americans accomplished in little more than in a single generation.” The Comstock silver lode was discovered in Nevada in 1859; gold in Montana in 1862; silver in Utah, 1869; gold in the Black Hills of Dakota, 1874. Colorado’s coalfields opened in the 1860s and ’70s. During the 1880s, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada began to dominate lead mining. Michigan and Wisconsin ranges were the largest sources of iron ore, until the Mesabi range of northern Minnesota opened. Midwestern petroleum fields dominated until the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Texas, in 1901, soon followed by California exploration.96 By 1900, the United States led the world in the extraction of industrial minerals—ranking first in coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, silver, tungsten, molybdenum, petroleum, arsenic, phosphate, antimony, magnetite, mercury, and salt, as well as a close second place in gold and bauxite.

### In the Age of Capital, the United States was a world agricultural powerhouse, exporting great volumes of many commodities. But in tandem with U.S. commitment to the deflationary gold standard, greater production contributed to falling prices, which exacerbated the debt burdens of many farmers.

### During 1944, as the outcome of the war looked increasingly secure, planning began for peacetime. Battle lines had already begun to appear in preparation for the great postwar political struggle over the size and purpose of the New Deal state. The final political-economic settlement of the Age of Control, the mix of regulatory and developmental policies, waited for the war to end. But “big government” was here to stay.

### With an Open Door flavor, the 1934 Reciprocal Tariff announced U.S. commitment to trade liberalization throughout the world and granted the president the authority to negotiate bilateral trade agreements in order to slowly chip away at ever-tightening European imperial trading blocs. Further, many New Dealers supported national programs of economic “development,” which meant industrialization, throughout the world.21 In 1940, for instance, the United States provided capital, credit, and technical assistance to Brazil for the construction of its Volta Redonda steelworks.

### appreciate the geographical transformation of U.S. economic life. For during World War II, a third, western industrialization took place, with far-reaching consequences.44 After the iron-, wood-, and textile-based industrialization of the Northeast during the Age of Commerce; and the steel-, coal-, and eventually mass production–based industrialization of the Northeast and Midwest in the Age of Capital; now, in the Age of Control, industrialization was based on aluminum, hydropower, and electronics. It took place in the South but above all in the Pacific West.

### By flipping the lights back on in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt, constructing a new industrial corridor in the Pacific West, and fashioning global supply chains, the Americans won the “war of the factories.” The pivotal year was 1942, when the United States produced $20 billion worth of munitions, compared to Germany’s $8.5 billion and Japan’s $3 billion.

### After decades of world economic recovery and growth, the dollar was now overvalued relative to other currencies. That hurt U.S. manufacturers at home and abroad. With them in mind, in 1973 President Richard Nixon’s administration broke the dollar-gold peg. The Bretton Woods international monetary system was over. Soon the United States lifted all cross-border capital controls. Now the value of the dollar would be determined in global currency trading markets—subject to the momentary whims of trade and speculative expectations.
