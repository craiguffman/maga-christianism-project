### Highlights

- First, Moses encounters the God of Israel under the appearances of a burning bush. Here an external charismatic miracle (visible to the senses) precedes the address of faith and the internal gift of supernatural prophecy. The bush or shrub is humble in nature and represents the elect people, Israel, in whom God is present or in whom he dwells. Meanwhile, the fire represents the living presence of God among his people, particularly in the truth of his law. “The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people” (13:22); “And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire” (19:18a). The initial appearance of God to Moses is probably meant to prefigure the revelation of the law given to the people at Horeb or Sinai. “When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain” (3:12).

- God’s holiness does not destroy the integrity of the creature in whom he becomes manifest but by his grace preserves and ennobles her in proximity to God.23 The burning tree is also a symbol of God’s presence on the Cross and in the Church.

- This external gesture symbolizes the interior gift of fear, which, the scriptures suggest, God typically pours into the heart of those he calls to prophesy on his behalf. “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?” (3:11). Such fear can be “servile” or “filial.”25 Fear is servile when the subject is motivated to obey God primarily out of fear of punishment; it is filial when the soul fears to offend God primarily out of love rather than the possibility of divine retribution.

- Catherine of Siena claims that filial fear gives the recipient a reverential sense of his own nothingness before God the Creator and is accompanied by piety, love, and surrender to God. “Do you know, daughter, who you are and who I am? You are she who is not, and I Am He Who Is.” ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=1159))

- The recipient of the gift of fear is aware of his or her unworthiness not primarily on account of any morbid self-detestation but due to love for the truth about who God is and who the creature is. Furthermore, the Torah here clearly suggests that unless one lives in this state of utter religious surrender to God as the Creator—who alone truly is in the absolute sense—one is not really living in the truth as regards one’s own person.

- If we encounter a stranger, we cannot know that person’s name unless he (or another) discloses it to us. Even less can we know the transcendent God unless he reveals himself to us personally. Consequently, the name here is given freely by God to Moses and pertains to his singular identity. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=1187))

- God, by essence, is. By contrast, all creatures that are caused to be depend upon God for the gift of their being and are thus ontologically composite. Their act of being does not pertain to their essence, and so there exists in each creature—from the angel to the smallest material particle—a real distinction between existence and essence. Creatures are capable of not being. They have their existence from God as their first cause and thus participate in being received from God, who is being of a higher and incomprehensible sort.

- the passage is saying that the God of Israel—who has chosen this people as his particular people and given them alone his name, his deliverance, his covenant, and his law—is also the God who alone is and who has created all things (Gen. 1:1). This God is the author of all peoples, Gentile and Jew alike, but he intends to bless all nations through the seed of Abraham (Gen. 22:18), and he has chosen to reveal himself personally to Moses in the miracle of the burning bush. God, the author of all reality, has spoken to Israel. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=1201))

- The moral and typological significations of this passage are brought out most especially by the representation of the walls of water, which are separated by the hand of Moses (14:22, 29). This image is intended to echo that of Gen. 1:6: “And God said, ‘Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.’” God creates the world by separating out the waters, and Exod. 14:22 depicts a new separation of the waters. In other words, God is now undertaking a “new creation” in the formation of the people of Israel. ([Location 2980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=2980))

- In Josh. 3:7–17, the people of Israel make a second crossing, this time over the Jordan River rather than the Red Sea, entering into the promised land. The waters part before the ark of the covenant, which is carried by the priests. The typological significance is clear: in forming the people of Israel, God gives the creation its deepest meaning and fulfillment.

- Luke portrays this as an eschatological event, one that fulfills the prophecies of Isaiah (Luke 3:3–6, 17). However, this new crossing-over is now the passion of Christ. It is only through the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus that the ultimate destiny of the creation is made manifest (24:26–27). All those who would belong to this new covenant must be incorporated into the grace of Christ by passing through baptism.

- Paul speaks of a historical prefiguration of this mystery in the crossing over of the Red Sea in 1 Cor. 10:1–4: “I want you to know, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same supernatural food and all drank the same supernatural drink. For they drank from the supernatural Rock which followed them, and the Rock was Christ.” ([Location 3002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=3002))

- In the words of Ambrose: Moses held his rod, and led the people of the Hebrews at night in a pillar of light, and in the day in a pillar of cloud. What is the light but truth, since it sheds a full and open brightness? What is the pillar of light but Christ the Lord, who scattered the shadows of unbelief, and poured the light of truth and spiritual grace on human hearts? The pillar of cloud, on the other hand, is the Holy Spirit. The people were in the sea, and the pillar of light went on before; then the pillar of cloud followed, as if the shadowing of the Holy Spirit. You see that by the Holy Spirit and by the water he has shown a type of baptism.8 ([Location 3006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=3006))

- the sea has a symbolic meaning, derived originally from the religious myths of the ancient Near East. Here it seems to represent the cosmic powers of chaos, death, and destruction to which the creation is potentially subject. These powers can destroy man. However, in his action at the Red Sea, God has declared his victory once and for all over the powers of “the deep” that threaten human existence and creation itself. Order has a primacy over chaos; life has a primacy over death. This victory of God and humanity together at the Red Sea foreshadows the final victory of Christ and the Church over the powers of evil and chaos, which risk to destroy the human race. “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. . . . And he who sat upon the throne said, ‘Behold, I make all things new’” (Rev. 21:1, 5). ([Location 3040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=3040))

- the location of this section of the text is not incidental. The people have ruptured the covenant, and the building of the tabernacle is endangered. And yet Moses retains a unique proximity to God. His encounters with God in this tent are presented as a kind of echo of Sinai. He still speaks with God intimately as he once did on the mountain, and the people join in prayer with him (33:10), which seemingly incorporates them into his act of reparation.

- The pillar of cloud is depicted again here, descending to the entrance of the tent (33:9).

- At the same time, Moses speaks with God “face to face,” which is the same expression used in Deut. 34:10 to denote the singularity of Moses: “There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.” ([Location 6794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6794))

- Does Moses literally gaze on God in his glory? Is the text meant to denote here an immediate spiritual vision of the inner life of God? It seems not. Just after this passage, Moses asks to behold God’s presence (Exod. 33:18) and is granted a fleeting glimpse of God in 34:6. Speaking with God “face to face” seems to denote a privileged intimacy and knowledge of God, particularly through the regular communication of prophetic understanding given to the human author of the law.

- In his plea he asks God to extend the favor God has shown him personally to the whole of the people and insists before God that this people alone are God’s own people (33:13). It is only because God remains with and saves Israel that all the nations of the earth will come to know who God truly is (33:16). Once again the centrality of the intercession of Moses is clear. It is “priestly” in its own fashion. He is not merely the one through whom the law is given (descending mediation) but also the one who implores God on behalf of the people (ascending mediation).

- Throughout this narration Moses is a type of Christ who is to come, the unique mediator of all grace (descending mediation) and the one who impetrates before God in prayer on our behalf to make reparation for human sin (ascending mediation). Christ is not only the new Moses but also the one whose intercession is intended by God from all eternity prior to all else in the economy of salvation. All genuine forms of mediation are ultimately christocentric in nature. They ([Location 6812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6812))

- In Exod. 33:18–23, Moses asks to see God. “I pray thee, show me thy glory” (33:18). Aquinas notes that when we perceive the effects of a hidden cause, we naturally desire to know the cause directly.16 The nobler and the more elevated the cause, the more avid the desire is. This is true particularly in the supernatural domain, where the effects by which God makes himself known are supernatural in kind and give a more excellent knowledge of God than is naturally available, communicating to us an inchoate understanding of who God is in his very essence. Here Moses exemplifies the life of the believer who is stimulated from within by the workings… ([Location 6818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6818))

- In Exod. 33–34, the mystery of God’s covenant with Israel is being reconstituted from the beginning, with all of its essential elements. However, God is also making manifest something new in light of the sin of Israel: God is mercy, and that mercy is at the heart of the covenant. The framing of the revelation here is significant: “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” is an echo of “I AM WHO I AM” (3:14). In one sense this compounds the apophatic meaning of the divine name given in 3:14 so that, in essence, God is saying, “I will be who I will be and I am free to show grace and mercy to those who I choose.” God is not determined by human failures or successes; God remains transcendent, free,… ([Location 6827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6827))

- In God’s transcendent freedom, God reveals himself to be gracious and merciful. After all, God tells Moses that he will show him his “goodness” (33:19). It is precisely because God in his transcendent aseity has no dependence upon any creaturely being that he alone who gives existence to all things can continue to provide for creatures even in the face of their resistance to his grace and goodness, without any diminishment of his ineffable actuality of being. He who is eternally is he who is able to show mercy eternally. God alone can give without ever being diminished and without adding in the slightest way to his infinite glory. Consequently there is a certain sense in which, by being… ([Location 6834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6834))

- Why can we not see God’s face? And what does it mean here to say anthropomorphically that Moses can only see God’s “back”? Regarding the first question, it is important to avoid a crucial error. One must not affirm that the soul is metaphysically incapable of seeing God face-to-face, for several reasons. First, the New Testament teaches that we are meant ultimately to see God face-to-face in the beatific vision (1 Cor. 13:12; 1 John 3:2; Rev. 21:23; 22:5). Second, natural reason cannot demonstrate that we are meant for the beatific vision, which is a grace transcending the scope of natural reason, but it can demonstrate that God exists; and since God remains only very imperfectly known by natural reason, we are able to desire naturally to know God perfectly and… ([Location 6841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012H10EPU&location=6841))

- human beings cannot see God face-to-face because it is not yet the time in which God has desired to reveal himself fully to humanity. This is the reading of Exod. 33:20 offered by 1 Tim. 6:13–16.

- Third, the text may signify that the human being can in no way comprehend the mystery of God. God is utterly transcendent of the finite capacities and pretentions of all human understanding.

- the imperfect mystical knowledge of God’s essence that can be obtained in this life, especially through knowledge of God’s effects of grace. The “rock” in which Moses hides represents the humanity of Christ, which gives us the most intimate knowledge of God’s presence in the world: I was running to lay hold on God, and thus I went up into the Mount, and drew aside the curtain of the Cloud, and entered away from matter and material things, and as far as I could I withdrew within myself. And then when I looked up, I scarce saw the back parts of God; although I was sheltered by the Rock, the Word that was made flesh for us. And when I looked a little closer, I saw, not the First and unmingled Nature, known to Itself—to the Trinity, I mean; not That which abides within the first veil, and is hidden by the Cherubim; but only that Nature, which at last even reaches to us. And that is, as far as I can learn, the Majesty, or as holy David calls it, the Glory which is manifested among the creatures, which It has produced and governs. For these are the Back Parts of God, which He leaves behind Him, as tokens of Himself like the shadows and reflection of the sun in the water, which show the sun to our weak eyes, because we cannot look at the sun himself, for by his unmixed light he is too strong for our power of perception.

- Aquinas has a different view and thinks the symbol of the “back” may signify a momentary experience of the beatific vision.20 Moses is given this “touch” of the deepest mystical union with God so that he will have sufficient perspective regarding who the Lord is and the grace of patience sufficient to lead the people of Israel over a long and arduous course. This is similar to Paul’s mystical vision of God recounted in 2 Cor. 12:2–4. He was strengthened so as to endure many hardships as the apostle to the Gentiles.

- what is most significant about this passage is that it introduces a central idea in divine revelation: the notion of beholding God, of seeing God by grace. In this sense, Exod. 33–34 lays the initial groundwork in scripture for the subsequent plenary revelation of the possibility of divinization of human beings by means of the grace of the beatific vision.
