### Highlights

- To its champions, it was a world in which goods and capital, if not people, flowed according to the logic of supply and demand, creating prosperity—or at least opportunity—for all. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=84))
- This philosophy of the rule of market forces was labeled “neoliberalism” by its critics. Neoliberals, we were told, believed in global laissez-faire: self-regulating markets, shrunken states, and the reduction of all human motivation to the one-dimensional rational self-interest of Homo economicus. The neoliberal globalists, it was claimed, conflated free-market capitalism with democracy and fantasized about a single world market without borders. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=86))
- My narrative corrects this storyline. It shows that self-described neoliberals did not believe in self-regulating markets as autonomous entities. They did not see democracy and capitalism as synonymous. They did not see humans as motivated only by economic rationality. They sought neither the disappearance of the state nor the disappearance of borders. And they did not see the world only through the lens of the individual. In fact, the foundational neoliberal insight is comparable to that of John Maynard Keynes and Karl Polanyi: the market does not and cannot take care of itself.

- I show that the neoliberal project focused on designing institutions—not to liberate markets but to encase them, to inoculate capitalism against the threat of democracy, to create a framework to contain often-irrational human behavior, and to reorder the world after empire as a space of competing states in which borders fulfill a necessary function.

- An early expression of doubt came from Joseph Stiglitz after the Asian financial crisis of 1997.9 World Bank chief economist from 1997 to 2000 and winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Stiglitz became a vocal critic of neoliberal globalization.

- My narrative knits together two strands of scholarship that have remained strangely disconnected. The first strand is the work to trace the intellectual history of the neoliberal movement.16 The second strand is the study of neoliberal globalist theory by social scientists, not historians. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=123))
- Although there were differences among these thinkers, my contention is that we can discern the broad strokes of a coherent prescription for world order in their writings and actions. Globalizing the ordoliberal principle of “thinking in orders,” their project of thinking in world orders offered a set of proposals designed to defend the world economy from a democracy that became global only in the twentieth century—producing a state of affairs and a set of challenges that their predecessors, the classical liberals, could never have predicted. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=134))
- “Insulation of markets” is a useful metaphorical description of the aim of neoliberalism as a specific institution-building project rather than as a nebulous “logic” or “rationality.” ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=147))
- Decolonization, I argue, was central to the emergence of the neoliberal model of world governance. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=157))

- that this was a critique of neoliberalism before the fact. Of a piece with the Polanyian language is the idea that the goal of neoliberals is to liberate markets or set them free. The otherwise uncommon adjective “unfettered” is attached habitually to “markets” as both neoliberal goal and putative reality.25 Against the intention of the authors of neoliberal theory, this metaphor essentializes the object of critique: the market becomes a thing capable of being liberated by agents, instead of being, as neoliberals themselves believed, a set of relationships that rely on an institutional framework. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=165))
- I build on the efforts of scholars since the turn of the millennium to conceive of the neoliberal project as “a simultaneous roll-back and roll-out of state functions.” ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=171))

- If we place too much emphasis on the category of market fundamentalism, we will fail to notice that the real focus of neoliberal proposals is not on the market per se but on redesigning states, laws, and other institutions to protect the market.

- Far from having a utopian belief in the market as operating independently of human intervention, “neoliberals … have pointed to the extra-economic conditions for a free economic system.” ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=187))
- The chapters that follow provide an exposition through time of the neoliberal idea that markets are not natural but are products of the political construction of institutions to encase them. Markets buttress the repository of cultural values that are a necessary but not sufficient condition for markets’ continued existence.

- shadows. As proposed here, the Geneva School includes thinkers who held academic positions in Geneva, Switzerland, among them Wilhelm Röpke, Ludwig von Mises, and Michael Heilperin; those who pursued or presented key research there, including Hayek, Lionel Robbins, and Gottfried Haberler; and those who worked at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), such as Jan Tumlir, Frieder Roessler, and Petersmann himself. Although they shared affinities with the Freiburg School, Geneva School neoliberals transposed the ordoliberal idea of “the economic constitution”—or the totality of rules governing economic life—to the scale beyond the nation. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=219))
- Correcting this elision is critical because it was the European neoliberals who were most attentive to questions of international order. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=230))
- My narrative presents a vision of neoliberal globalism viewed from Central Europe, because it was Central European neoliberals who most consistently looked at the world as a whole. Both Chicago School and Virginia School thinkers exhibited the peculiarly American quality of ignoring the rest of the world while assuming that America was a working model of it.43 European neoliberals did not have this luxury, as they existed for most of the century under the influence of varying levels of U.S. hegemony. It made sense that Central European neoliberals were precocious theorists of world order. Their countries did not enjoy a vast domestic market like that of the United States, so they were forced to be more attentive to the question of access to the world market through either trade or annexation. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=231))
- Geneva School neoliberals disagreed with this narrative. To their mind, commitments to national sovereignty and autonomy were dangerous if taken seriously. They were stalwart critics of national sovereignty, believing that after empire, nations must remain embedded in an international institutional order that safeguarded capital ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=245))
- The cardinal sin of the twentieth century was the belief in unfettered national independence, and the neoliberal world order required enforceable isonomy—or “same law,” as Hayek would later call it—against the illusion of autonomy, or “own law.” ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=248))
- Geneva School neoliberals reconciled the tension between the world economy and the world of nations through their own distinct geography. Their global imaginary was sketched by the erstwhile Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt in 1950. Schmitt proposed that there was not one world but ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=250))
- imaginary was sketched by the erstwhile Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt in 1950. Schmitt proposed that there was not one world but two. One was the world partitioned into bounded, territorial states where governments ruled over human beings. This he called the world of imperium, using the Roman legal term. The other was the world of property, where people owned things, money, and land scattered across the earth. This was the world of dominium. The doubled world of modern capitalism coalesced in the nineteenth century. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=251))

- still yours after the enemy army had swept through. To Schmitt, the division between dominium and imperium was more fundamental than the purely political distinction of foreign and domestic. The most important border did not halve the world like an orange into East and West, or North and South, but preserved overlapping wholes in suspension, like an orange’s pith and peel. “Over, under and beside the state-political borders of what appeared to be a purely political international law between states,” he wrote, “spread a free, i.e. non-state sphere of economy permeating everything: a global economy.” ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=258))
- But neoliberals felt he had offered the best description of the world they wanted to conserve. Wilhelm Röpke, who taught in Geneva for nearly thirty years, believed that exactly this division would be the basis for a liberal world order. The ideal neoliberal order would maintain the balance between the two global spheres through an enforceable world law, creating a “minimum of constitutional order” and a “separation of the state-public sphere from the private domain.” ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=264))
- The consequences of the doubled globe for reimagining the world after empire are dismissed all too easily in narratives of modern global history as the passage from colonial subjugation to national independence. Few thinkers engaged with the consequences of this doubled world more than the group of economists and lawyers described in these pages. Convinced from the beginning of the century that there was and could only be a single world economy, they strove to reconcile mutual economic dependency with political self-determination. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=274))
- from its beginnings Geneva School neoliberalism has been less a discipline of economics than a discipline of statecraft and law. More than making markets, these neoliberals have concentrated on making market enforcers. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=279))
- Unlike the ordoliberals, who called for an “economic constitution” at the level of the nation, the Geneva School neoliberals called for an economic constitution for the world. I argue that we can understand the proposal of the Geneva School as a rethinking of ordoliberalism at the scale of the world. We might call it ordoglobalism.

- Geneva School neoliberals offered a blueprint for globalism based on institutions of multitiered governance that are insulated from democratic decision making and charged with maintaining the balance between the political world of imperium and the economic world of dominium.

([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=293))
- neoliberals from the 1930s to the 1970s used a geographic version of the metaphor to attack the belief in the possibility of “economic insulation,” meaning a degree of self-sufficiency that would buffer nations from shocks of change in global markets. Neoliberals described this devotion to self-sufficiency as having the capacity to “destroy the universal society” and “shatter the world.” ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=296))

- The nation could be useful insofar as it provided services of stabilization (which would often include restrictions to migration) and cultivated legitimacy in the political sphere. But like democracy, it also bore the risk of tipping into excess. Thus, it needed to be constrained just as democracy did. Neoliberals believed in what could be called militant globalism or, adapting Müller’s term, constrained nationalism—the need for a set of institutional safeguards and legal constraints to prevent nation-states from transgressing their commitments to the world economic order. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=345))
- Just as proponents of militant democracy perceived a need to constrain democracy, proponents of militant globalism perceived a need to constrain nation-states and set limits on their exercise of sovereignty. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=357))

- In this narrative, the market is omnivorous, relentlessly transforming land, labor, and money into commodities, until the basis for social life has been destroyed. Capitalism, according to this analysis, needs an opposition to save it from itself. By confronting and absorbing challenges, from workers’ insurance to the welfare state, capitalism secures the social conditions that allow it to persist.

- In a neoliberal history of the century, decolonization began in 1919; fascism looked promising to some until it raised tariff walls; the Cold War was secondary to the war against the Global New Deal; the end of apartheid was seen by some as a tragedy; and countries were secondary entities subordinate to the totality of the globe.

- Foreign-owned property was seized, command economies replaced market supply and demand, centralized regimes of rationing and resource allocation displaced the price mechanism, and national governments and planning boards demolished the walls of corporate secrecy, intruded into private accounts and affairs of business to gather data about production and distribution, and created what some called “war socialism” ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=577))
- In the course of the war, the sacred nature of private property across borders was violated; the space of the private capitalist was desecrated. Private accounts were now part of state knowledge, rendered as inputs into a comprehensive plan for allocating the nation’s resources. Nowhere was the collapse of the division between public and private more catastrophic than in the sites of successful socialist revolutions: the Soviet Union in 1917, the Bavarian Soviet republic of 1918, and the Hungarian revolution under Bela Kun. But the era after the First World War saw everywhere a great exposure of corporate secrets—business had to be made visible, and for its own good. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=582))
- To the group that would become the neoliberals, the era after 1918 was marked by an attempt to reestablish what they saw as the correct balance between the public world of government and the private world of property and contract. Concretely, this translated into a series of projects of capitalist internationalism. There needed to be a respect for private property that trumped national law. Investment must be able to cross borders back and forth without fear of obstacles or expropriation. Capital needed to become cosmopolitan again.

- Liberals perceived tariff walls and workers’ wage demands as two kinds of barricades in the market. Achieving the liberal ideal required a state that could eliminate obstacles to trade and obstacles to the adjustment of wages. This meant a militant and, when necessary, militarized opposition to the strategies of organized labor to protect their salaries and their state-granted entitlements.

- building wide streets that could serve simultaneously as sites of cultural enrichment in their opera houses and museums, expressions of state power in their monuments, and sites of consumption in their shop windows and sidewalk cafes.15 The wide streets would also make it harder for future insurgents to build the barricades that characterized the revolutions of 1848. Both designs included arsenals and barracks for the easy deployment of troops to quell domestic threats. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=643))
- strong role for the state in the protection of property and keeping of the peace. In a telling phrase from 1922, he called the state “a producer of security.”21 For Mises, the assessment of state action depended on the field of engagement.

- One could argue that the “end of the liberal era”—as the advent of a new paradigm of militarized liberalism, later to be called neoliberalism—developed precisely as a response to the growth of mass democracy. This new paradigm was centered, not in the parliament or university, but in the triumvirate of security, finance, and commerce located in the Stuben Quarter. A well-armed state and sound money flanked by business were the icons of the ideology taking shape. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=683))

- the idea of the Most-Favored-Nation model implicitly, that is, the idea that the reduction of a tariff toward one country would involve lowering those for all other countries automatically. This norm was enshrined at the 1927 World Economic Conference against U.S. tariffs; it would crumble in the protectionist 1930s, only to return with the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after the Second World ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=832))
- The primary problem was the most obvious one: the unwillingness of European workers to accept lower wages for the sake of either the higher law of liberalism or, as in Mises’s argument, the benefit of a distant, likely nonwhite, foreign worker.

- Mises’s policy prescriptions in the 1920s always had two sides: open to the world market, and make the internal adjustments necessary to compete internationally. This required two key measures: push down wages, and cut taxes on industry. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=855))

- “The significance of the democratic form of constitution is something quite different from all this. Its function is to make peace, to avoid violent revolutions.”75 If populations felt that their voice and opinion had effects on the composition of the government, then they would less frequently reach for violent means. The definition of equality must remain minimalist though, exhausting itself with equality before the law. Attempting to enforce equality beyond this would be to deny the basic fact “that men are endowed differently by nature.” ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=899))

- in 1930, he argued that the terms of trade, the interest rate, and the prices of many commodities were determined by world economic conditions, and were thus out of the control of the Austrian authorities. The only thing they could change were wages and taxes. Both had to be lowered to bring down production costs. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=917))

- In contrast to the typical policy-minded economist in the late nineteenth century, who would have been a social reformer seeking to counteract and mollify the effects of capitalism, there emerged in the interwar period a generation of economists who sought to apply their knowledge in service of capital.

- He explained that he used the category of “countries” in quotation marks because the distribution of resources relevant to a model of world economic integration did not necessarily align with “political borders.”106 This optic bracketed the political, creating a vision of the world that was either pre- or postnational, depending on how one looked at it. The whole earth was a container of natural endowments over which political communities made claims. Haberler’s ideal policy would make reality more closely resemble the model of a “spaceless” world economy where neither man-made nor geographical obstacles hindered the most efficient allocation of the earth’s resources through the mechanisms of the free market. Imagining a spaceless world was not pure fantasy in ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=1043))
- movement of that most essential commodity: human labor. Haberler saw labor as sticky but highly versatile when forced to move. He praised workers for their ability to adapt but condemned them for wanting to stay in place. The danger lay where labor gained allies that acted as anchors. He blamed organized labor and “state intervention in labor questions in connection with unemployment insurance and unemployment relief” for decreasing labor’s “mobility and adaptability.”111 Trade unions were not only anchors. Like Mises, he saw them as walls. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=1063))
- One historian calls the 1930s the “end of globalization.”1 After its surprising recovery after the First World War, international trade slowed again as national governments sheltered domestic production behind tariff walls of unprecedented height. In the world of money, the United States suspended the convertibility of dollars into gold in 1931, followed by the British pound. The end of the gold standard meant that one could no longer assume that today’s investment, even denominated in the storied world currency of the pound, would be worth the same amount in gold tomorrow. In the minds of liberals, this was an attack on not just the sanctity of money but the sanctity of contract. One German liberal claimed that this act, more than any other, had “broken the economic unity of the world.” ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=1094))
- As the gold standard dissolved, the empire principle, which had suffered a blow after the end of the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires, revived as the European powers relied on their colonies and commonwealths for raw materials traded behind tariff walls in imperial blocs.

- revealed the anatomy of the world’s economic structure.”10 The core group of the future neoliberal movement either relocated to Geneva or passed through the Swiss city in the 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, they were all involved with projects of either creating statistical portraits of the national and world economies or seeking to understand their cyclical rise and fall. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=1130))
- Historians refer to the famous 1938 Lippmann Colloquium in Paris as the “birthplace of neoliberalism.”11 They rarely note, though, that it was only one episode in a decade of overlapping projects devoted to studying the conditions of “the Great Society,” not at the national level but at the scale of the globe. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BF46YN2&location=1137))
- Neoliberalism was born out of projects of world observation, global statistics gathering, and international investigations of the business cycle. Why is this fact so often missed by historians? Part of the reason is that the ultimate conclusion of neoliberals about the Great Depression and its aftermath was that numbers were not enough. Even as techniques of planning gained traction both in Geneva and in the mainstream of the economics profession by the end of the 1930s, neoliberals rallied around the belief that neither statistics, nor mathematically informed theory, nor the nascent science of econometrics would suffice to forecast or stave off future crises. They even thought that the increasing sophistication of such approaches might, counterintuitively, be increasing the likelihood of another crisis by fostering the false faith that science could make the world economy crisis-proof.

- Business cycle research—and the visual technique of the business barometer—helped place the economist alongside the medical doctor as the master of an esoteric branch of knowledge amenable to a mode of representation comprehensible to the average person. As one historian has observed, the 1920s were a time when economics became understood as a domain of technical expertise beyond politics.
