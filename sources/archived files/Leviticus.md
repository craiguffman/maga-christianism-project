### Highlights

- This has, in fact, been an aspect of the root word’s meaning that philologists have underlined: if—as is most commonly done—the base for the Hebrew family of words designating “holy” (qad) is linked with some basic sense of “separateness,” then one crucial element of being “set apart” in this context is the goal: set apart “for God,” becoming, as it were, the “possession” of God. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=1315))
- holiness is for others, ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=2132))
- inasmuch as it is for God; holiness is “for the sake of.” This, somewhat, bridges the gap between the subjective and objective aspects. But a gap there is: holiness, as (etymologically) separateness, uncovers this gap between persons, even as it leaps into it. ([Location 2133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=2133))
- I have already noted the way in which separation is an active aspect of love itself, in that it both stands as the basis of creation—the invention of the other who is loved—and also thereby orders the giving of love as the costly embrace of separation’s chasm of being and identity. ([Location 2196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=2196))
- To distinguish is (from a human perspective) to learn to love, by analogy with the creating act of God; to love in this way, distinctively, is to learn to reconcile. ([Location 2199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=2199))
- The Greek word translated “reconciliation” (katallassō and its cognates) had an original economic implication of adjusted levels of “exchange”—labor, money, salaries. As the term was later applied, in a standard fashion, to the reconciliation of estranged parties, the notion of adjustment remained fundamental and pointed to the capacity for distinct agents to order themselves toward one another away from hostility and in favor of peaceful engagement. Certainly reconciliation presupposes difference, but it also maintains it in a transfigured fashion. There is no love without otherness, nor can reconciliation count as anything without offering.[3] ([Location 2201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=2201))
- the substance of this center, as most readers of the text agree, is the call to holiness: “Say to all the congregation of the people of Israel, You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy” (19:2). ([Location 4077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4077))

- creation. Holiness is less a quality or character attributed to God—and reflected in creatures—than it is a description of how God in fact temporally wills to act with respect to his creation, by coming to it with his whole being. ([Location 4082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4082))
- Leviticus 19:2 takes what almost seemed a passing divine exhortation in 11:44—“be holy, for I am holy”—and turns it into the summary description of the entire ethical law of the book: “You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.” As ([Location 4086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4086))

- Ought we to see holiness as a quality? If so, how is it consistent among both the laws of animal distinction and caring for the poor (as in 19:9–10)? ([Location 4095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4095))

- Leviticus 11:44’s context of distinction coheres with the standard conception of the Hebrew term for holiness, qedusha (sometimes spelled kadusha), which has the connotation of separate and distinct. ([Location 4097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4097))
- Kiddushin, the wedding betrothal that marks the reality (if not the consummation) of a marriage (and is impossible for concubines), is granted the “sanctified” character because through it the two individuals are distinguished from all others in their commitment to one another. If bound to the reality of distinction, then holiness is distinction for the purpose of creative substance, of the gift of traversing distance, with all its cost and glory. ([Location 4099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4099))
- If holiness is about separation, then it is a separation for the sake of granting life and the giving over of oneself as the basis for its very being. ([Location 4103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4103))
- The holiness of the marriage betrothal is constituted just there, not simply in a bare distinction of two grouped individuals, but in their coupling, their one fleshedness. ([Location 4104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4104))

- The link with holiness in this, however, is that with God the limits and distinctions are both given and overcome at once. The boundless one creates limits; yet he creates them only by going beyond them in his own self. ([Location 4111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4111))

- If we are to speak of holiness in terms of separation, then, we must not do so only in a negative sense—separation from, for example, the world, sin, impurity. It is rather a separation of distinction that draws us into a relationship with the one who alone can make distinctions and reconcile them. Holiness is somehow about locality, proximity, and passage.

- If holiness can describe a movement toward God’s proximity, it is therefore a kind of approach. As I discussed earlier, such an approach is of the nature of sacrifice itself, the offering of the self as, and with the end that, one comes near God in the midst of the great chasm of creation that defines our distinction as living beings. Actions then can be holy to the degree that they act as this offering, both as a means… ([Location 4122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4122))

- Holiness is a calling to be with God where God is and where God goes—and his own going, to us in our creation and redemption, is all that is holy. The version of Lev. 19:2 used by Jesus in Matt. 5:48—“be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect”—is cited to his disciples as an acknowledgment of this passage into greater and greater maturity, a perfected completeness that is given as they attend closely to the call of Jesus to go with him. As the Lord “called Moses” (Lev. 1:1) and thus the entire book of Leviticus comes under this calling, so… ([Location 4139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4139))
- Leviticus does not define holiness, either God’s or our own, in an abstract way, as a quality or an essence. The direction of the present reflection moves toward a common Christian way of looking at God’s holiness as that which is the coincidence of his very being and act. In the context of Christian revelation, this is something that is fully and exhaustively real in the temporal life, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming again of Jesus Christ—no more and no less.

- From the perspective of Scripture and of Leviticus as a constituent part of Scripture, an objective power that we can call the holy does not pervade the cosmos, nor is our religious existence—of whatever kind!—a carefully ordered attempt to navigate this dangerous world of mana, in which we can trace a progression of increasingly efficacious methods for controlling and perhaps finally eliminating its disruptive intrusions. ([Location 4212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4212))
- “You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy” is a calling uttered in love by God that leads us into and forms the very character of time as we traverse it toward him and in fact with him. The passage is costly, in the world of difference and its exaggeration through sin, and this seems to be the import of the terror implied in Exod. 19:16–24 or Isa. 6:1–5. But the terror is not inherent in God, for it is not because God is holy—too dangerous in himself to be approached—that God cannot be seen (Exod. 33:20; John 1:18). It is because God is seen by mortal creatures that God is holy and hence known to be glorious (1:14). ([Location 4215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4215))

- We have looked at sacrifice as the offering of difference, that is, of creaturely being. This ([Location 4220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4220))
- is the movement of love, and the holiness of God is the fundamental divine movement of that love, which is creative, redemptive of sin, restorative, renewing, and transformative. ([Location 4220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4220))

- Holiness as a human reality, conversely, is responsive to this act of divine offering—“for I the LORD your God am holy.” Indeed, it is finally derivative of it. ([Location 4224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4224))
- When Paul has sung the hymn of this great act in Phil. 2:5–11, he goes on to describe this response and derivation: “Therefore, my beloved, . . . work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”—this is the “same mind” as Christ’s (2:5), with all of its communal self-offering implied—“for God is at work in you”—this is the first offering of Christ himself—and this offering draws its objects of love into the very midst of its own movement: “both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (2:12–13). Only God himself makes holy, in the sense that it is his own coming that brings close. ([Location 4226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4226))
- As the Baal Shem Tov noted on this text (2005: 3), each person’s very creation is given through the self-offering of God and is hence a “portion” of him (working from Job 31:2): to love another person is to enter the realm of God’s participatory coming-close and coming-within. It is to love God (Deut. 6:5), quite literally, by being made a part of his love given and received together.

- The laws of holiness, then, are intimately bound to the nature of God’s selfcoming to his creatures in time: they constitute a participation somehow in that very coming. ([Location 4236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4236))
- But if Lev. 19 is indeed a restatement of the Decalogue, not already defined in terms of a prior natural law, but as the revelation of God to Israel first and foremost, this restatement should be viewed as continuous with the character of its original receipt: God’s costly approach to the human creature, given its flesh in the law fulfilled in Christ Jesus, who draws the world to the Father in his obedient love. The law here is not some timeless ordering of life, but the actual movement of life through time, across the divides of creative being. To speak of God as the absolutely other in this case would make sense only within a context in which what is absolutely other has actually and in fact created that which it can love, move toward, and touch and be touched by. ([Location 4251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4251))
- The struggle for obedience passes through the historical realities of consequence and response. The law in Leviticus is historicized in the sense of being described as a passage within space and time. And the passage is given in the shape of provision, its loss, and its costly rededication.

- Beginning with a discussion of the holiness described in Lev. 19:2 as of the nature of separation, it then discusses this in terms of God’s primary work of distinguishing reality in the creation of the world and of thereby marking off the line between life and nothingness. ([Location 4260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4260))
- Israel in its vocation is distinct and holy; but that is because it stands as a witness to the fact of God’s justice and mercy as fundamental to existence itself: Zion (siyyun) is special to God on account of its embeddedness in this creative distinction (siyyun) marked out from other nations. But the witness it offers is always to something greater, to God’s surpassing holiness that lies at the root of and beyond anything Israel might embody. ([Location 4264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4264))
- But if God’s holiness is beyond Israel’s in every way, how shall Israel be holy, except by engaging in the creative provision of the law’s distinctive ordering of the universe? ([Location 4273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4273))
- Holiness rightly defines the law—but holiness understood in terms of the dynamic work of God who comes, whose creation is his coming toward that which he makes for himself. Holiness as this divine fruitfulness, then, becomes the center of the law in Lev. 19, indeed of the law as a whole. ([Location 4280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4280))
- Holiness is the work of creation, the giving of life. By the same token, the works of creation—which are bound to the ordering of fluids and family, of mutual care and trust—are, in their derivation from God’s self-offering, sanctifying. ([Location 4288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4288))
- the love commandment of Lev. 19:18 is reiterated in terms of the stranger also, on the basis of God’s own gathering up of his people who were strangers and exiles (19:34). From a Pauline perspective, the divine imperative behind all is now “what builds up” as opposed to what “tears down” (1 Cor. 8:1; 14:12, 26; Eph. 4:16, 29), for God’s very act is to grow (1 Cor. 3:6). To obstruct such growth and upbuilding in any way is itself a profanation of God’s name. ([Location 4357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009LL7ERG&location=4357))
