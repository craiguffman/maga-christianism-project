- question of how to disidentify with and detach ourselves from the idolatrous structures and cultural processes that condition our ways of understanding and describing everyday practices related to such activities as learning, using technology, working, borrowing and lending, eating, and citizenship.

- Thomas Arnold and F. D. Maurice are two of the most prominent developers of Coleridge’s ideas in the nineteenth century. ([Location 4236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4236))
- Coleridge initiated a distinctive strand in the tradition of Anglican moral and political thought by rejecting a notion of natural law as that which can be excavated by reason alone. ([Location 4240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4240))

- For Coleridge, inattention to our actual forms of life through overly abstract kinds of reasoning renders us not only mere spectators but also spectral beings alienated from any determinate form of life. By contrast, close attention to, participation in, and open-hearted wonder about the world around us can generate… ([Location 4246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4246))

- Rather, the primary contrast to be kept in view is with natural law as an approach to moral theology. Natural law theories tend to conceptualize nature as having predetermined, protological ends that can be enumerated independently of any particular instantiation of, say, the family. They also tend to emphasize an intrinsic set of properties, universal laws, or rationally determined ends.11 By contrast, an approach that makes a particular cultural historical form of life the beginning point and primary focus of moral… ([Location 4268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4268))

- the Rime is part of his attempt to critique and contest the emergence of consumer culture in eighteenth-century Britain, a culture built on slavery, imperial expansion, and the relentless commodification of nature. According to Thomas Pfau, the Rime does not protest this or that particular issue but rather the broader orientation to and way of imagining our place in creation. ([Location 4285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4285))
- Rather than seeking to cultivate our created being in pursuit of God-given ends and enable participation in creation in ways that hallow and cultivate it, the Rime portrays the modern condition as one of purposeless, spiritually empty curiosity driven by a desire to gratify our whims. ([Location 4290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4290))
- Christian ethics has tended to focus on two dimensions of a single task, ([Location 4302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4302))
- what it means to be “the church” in relationship to “the world” ([Location 4304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4304))
- The Christian ethicist is not a visitor on a research trip noting the strange flora and fauna of an exotic but alien terrain but rather a fellow worshipper and citizen sharing a common life with others on whom he or she depends and without which life and faith would not be possible.

- most common methods Christian ethicists deploy ([Location 4316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4316))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- interpreting the Scriptures ([Location 4316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4316))
- excavating the social and intellectual histories of the Christian tradition, and analyzing the “signs of the times” through engaging diverse philosophical frameworks, theoretical critiques, and forms of social scientific analysis. Sometimes this requires focusing on the everyday (e.g., how we grow our food, what counts as food, whom we should eat with) and sometimes this requires attention to the exceptional (e.g., defining abortion and whether it is licit). ([Location 4317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4317))
- Ethics, as a “wisdom-determined activity,” requires being apprenticed into a particular form of life and way of seeing the world that enables one to make right judgments about how to act appropriately: virtue ethics is thereby constitutively concerned with the everyday. That said, the primary focus of Christian virtue ethicists such as Hauerwas was not the everyday but rather ecclesial practices, such as baptism and the Eucharist. ([Location 4327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4327))
- the ordinary and everyday world is the site at which forms of domination, and the precarity and oppression they produce, are most acutely displayed. ([Location 4333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4333))
- concerns contemporary Christian ethicists address. These include the treatment of the environment, and what we grow and how we eat; constructions of class, sexuality, gender, and kinship and thence the basic forms of human life together; the nature and form of citizenship; how to understand friendship as a moral relation; and what we buy and how we buy it via processes of consumerism. ([Location 4337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4337))
- ethnography merely provides a more inductive, systematic, and contextually attuned method of asking the questions “What is going on?” and “What is to be done?” It does this through paying attention to, first, the somatic, affective, spatial, and temporal dimensions of moral and political discourses and judgments and, second, to the inevitable struggles and conflicts through which we come to be formed and tell the truth about our churches, our world, and our ourselves. ([Location 4341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4341))
- Conversely, intellectual history and theoretical critique—the primary form Christian ethics takes in the modern period—are prone to bracket their own structural and historical location from the analysis and often sit so far above the fray that they forget they are also participants in that which they study. ([Location 4350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4350))
- Ethnography can act as a poultice against abstraction, mystification, generalizations based on anecdote, the confusion of a worldly teleology for eschatology, and an amnesia that we are worshippers and citizens first and academics second. ([Location 4355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4355))
- It is, at least tacitly, committed to an epistemology in which knowledge of the world comes primarily through participation and apprenticeship and not through generalization and abstraction. It is thus more consonant with an incarnational understanding of truth: the truths of revelation are participative and relational events to be encountered, inhabited, and habituated into and not things or ideas to be possessed. ([Location 4357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4357))
- Moreover, the accuracy of our apprehension of God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ is not, ultimately, assessed by whether we espouse this or that statement of faith but by the quality and depth of our love of God and neighbor. ([Location 4360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4360))

- is the move to constructive theology in reference to how to imagine new and good ways to live as those for whom Christ has died, Christ has risen, and Christ will come again that provides a normative point of reference for ethnographic evaluative description. ([Location 4365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4365))
- with broader conceptualizations emerging in an iterative and dialogical process that moves from the particular to the universal, not vice versa. ([Location 4368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4368))
- politics, by nature, is about action in time. ([Location 4370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4370))
- The unpredictable and unstable nature of political life directs attention away from universal principles and general historical patterns toward the peculiar features of singular events and institutions within particular historical contexts. ([Location 4371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4371))
- This brings me to a broader point: political and moral judgments are discovered, not made. We do not impose meaning on the world by a voluntaristic act of will, as clunky distinctions between fact and value suppose. The universe is not a blank slate. Rather, we discover the world and its meanings and purposes through immersion in particular forms ([Location 4374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4374))
- This lifeworld is one that creates us, and that we create, in an ongoing process. It is the water we swim in, which flows through us, and in which we flow. Our lifeworld, our judgments, and our visions of the good are mutually constitutive and coemergent. ([Location 4378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4378))

- how materiality, history, and culture are the crucibles of divine-human encounter. ([Location 4386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4386))
- But Milbank’s own approach must also be questioned. It is not sufficient to position theology as an independent sphere of knowledge that can disregard political and social theory or social scientific kinds of analysis as anti-theology. ([Location 4396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4396))
- To parse and extend Hauerwas, if the world cannot know itself as the world without the church, the church cannot know itself as the church without the world. ([Location 4409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4409))

- To be a “sister,” “brother,” or “citizen” requires conceptualizations of those terms in relation to actual sisters, brothers, and citizens and their histories and our encounter with each other as sisters and brothers in Christ and citizens of the kingdom of God. ([Location 4410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4410))
    - **Note:** This is fundamental to the creation of character; we need exemplars to teach us the meanings of words.
- Ethnography offers a disciplined way of paying attention to and excavating the intersection of ecclesial practices with social and political life. It thereby gives us a way to generate conceptualizations fully alive to the ways church and world are interdependent and mutually constitutive yet also not the same. ([Location 4412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4412))
- Yet neither can an analysis of the church be separated from how it is in a relationship of codetermination (and at times co-construction) with its political, social, and economic environment. What I mean by codetermination is illustrated by Charles Taylor’s account of how secularity is the result not of external processes of modernization acting on belief and practice wherein the political environment determines the nature of belief and practice, nor of the internal logic of Christianity, but of how belief and unbelief are themselves constantly interacting and changing. Belief and unbelief codetermine and mutually constitute each other in an ongoing way. ([Location 4420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4420))
- an attempt to move beyond overly materialist assumptions that dominate political theory and inherently construe theological discourses as epiphenomenal and therefore marginal to understanding political life.

- Inattention to the actual embodiment and performance of religious beliefs and practices is deeply problematic, not least because it replicates an ideological marginalization of religion to the private, the internal, and the subjective and thereby replicates methodologically many of the false assumptions about the nature of religious belief and practice that underwrote the secularization thesis. ([Location 4446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4446))
- a form of faithful secularity in which political and theological beliefs and practices are understood as coemergent, standing simultaneously in a mutually reparative and critical relation to each other. ([Location 4452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4452))
- sets the scene for constructive moral judgments based on practical reason. Theologically, such judgments are in the service of better (that is, more faithful, loving, and hopeful) ways of being alive. ([Location 4465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4465))

- the question of whether, east of Eden, conflict or harmony is the basic character of social, political, and economic relations.

([Location 4475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4475))
- On such an account, community is understood as either a static or inherited social formation that is subject to inevitable dissolution through processes of modernization such as industrialization and urbanization.43 In ecclesial terms, the role of the church is to shore up or protect community from the depredations of modernity.

- certain reading of Augustine. It is this latter view that underlies both Coleridge and Banner’s approach. Modernity, with its technological prowess, commercial spirit, and will to power represents the antithesis of the city of God and incarnates the libido dominandi of the earthly city.

- contrary to Augustine, for whom the saeculum was a field of wheat and tares, this modernity-critical stream of Augustinianism introduces a temporal division and, with it, a dangerous nostalgia that sacralizes the past and falsely demonizes the present, forgetting that the Spirit can make Christ present to all times and places.

- there is a consistent move by twentieth-century European theologians to pose an Augustinian Christian moral vision as the last redoubt against a Nietzschean future of domination and depravity.44 Joseph Ratzinger and John Milbank are but two prominent contemporary examples of such a stance.

- They saw community as an ongoing work of institution building and social interaction through which people form meaningful relationships and develop a collective sense of identity and place over time.

- Just and compassionate forms of life together and common objects of love in the earthly city must be discovered through processes of conflict and conciliation. Of necessity, if this process of discovery is to be faithful, it entails rendering ourselves vulnerable to God and neighbor.

- Part of becoming otherwise is disidentifying with and disinvesting in the structures and systems that unjustly privilege and insulate us from encountering and being shaped by others, particularly the poor and marginalized (the friendless), in ways we cannot control.

- a form of disciplined and active listening, ethnography thereby echoes Ambrose’s exhortation: “The law says: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God.’ It said not: ‘Speak,’ but ‘Hear.’ . . . Be silent therefore first of all, and hearken, that thou fail not in thy tongue.”55 For Ambrose, as for St. Paul, faith and the body of Christ come to be through an act of listening.

- Without attention to the quotidian ways people are able to act in concert and form a sensus communis through public practices of speech and action, we have little to say other than wolves eat sheep, power corrupts, and the strong triumph over the weak.

- relational power “corresponds to the human ability not just to act, but to act in concert. [Relational] power is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together.” ([Location 4587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YCX9JWN&location=4587))
- The early labor and civil rights movements, along with broad-based community organizing, are paradigmatic examples of such relational power in action, and all depended on forms of practice and habituation drawn from traditions of popular piety such as those found in Methodism, Black-led churches, and Roman Catholicism.

- Rather, it formulates judgments through dialogic encounter with practice. Flux and multiplicity become occasions for refinement and further specificity. For moral theologians, such judgments are contributions to and caught up within an ongoing argument about what it means in practice to bear faithful, hopeful, and loving witness to Jesus Christ in the power of the Spirit.

- for Coleridge, “The besetting sin of radicals and reactionaries . . . was love of abstraction and oversimplification which generated ‘partial’ views of society and what it meant to be human.
