### Highlights

- Tillich, moreover, was a deeply loyal man who remained faithful to his own calling. At an early age he was drawn to theology and philosophy, and cast aside earlier dreams of becoming an architect. He was a humanist in the fullest sense of the word: he was filled with a high personal sense of the character of civilization. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=74))
- Tillich had married shortly before the war began. When he returned to Berlin in 1919, he discovered that his wife had been unfaithful to him and that she was bearing his best friend’s child. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=112))
- During this third phase of the historical period in which Tillich lived, he felt he should help his contemporaries withstand the existential problems and difficulties that tend to emerge in a time of cultural transition. It was clear to him that because traditional values had lost their appeal, many people were overcome by a sense of emptiness. They had become victims of the anxiety of meaninglessness. Accordingly, Tillich tried to understand the human situation as deeply and fully as possible, paying attention not only to special problems in ecclesiastical and political systems but also the structures of human anxiety, conflict, and guilt. Tillich therefore endeavored to interpret the Christian message so that his contemporaries would be able to understand it as a living gospel, one that would speak to them. He hoped that a reinterpretation of Christian symbols and forms of expression would renew their power. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=149))
- Although Tillich tried to interpret the Christian religion for intellectuals who had been thrown into spiritual emptiness—a condition caused by secularization—he did not, in fact, speak their language; he understood their condition and empathized with their anxiety, but he spoke to them in his own language. Essentially, Tillich feared that modern civilization, having ceased to be theonomous, might fall under demonic control. Indeed, this had already happened for a time under the Nazi and Bolshevik dictatorships and in similar movements and tendencies throughout Western civilization. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=157))
- In defining religion, which he regarded as “the substance, the ground and the depth of man’s spiritual life,” Tillich employed the term ultimate concern. “Religion,” or “faith,” he said, is the state of being grasped by the power of “being itself,” by an “unconditional concern” or by “that which concerns one unconditionally.” This is Tillich’s own definition, though it sounds very much like Luther’s… ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=161))
- Another interesting concept Tillich used was the New Being. Here he was thinking of Paul’s saying in 2 Cor. 5:17: “If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed way; behold, they are become new.” This illustrates perfectly Tillich’s conviction that the “old symbols,” namely doctrines, creedal and liturgical formulas, must be “deliteralized.” He did not think that these terms should be demythologized, but he felt that, instead of being interpreted literally, they should be taken spiritually. He expressed their meaning in terms he had derived either from… ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=166))
- He chooses a word in religious language which is subject to more misunderstanding, distortions, and questionable definitions than any other, and what he says about faith is still valid today. It is the confusion about the word “faith” that creates skepticism, Tillich argues. If he were able to find a… ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=173))
- He still dares us to give ourselves to something larger than we are in the hope that we shall find our true selves: this “giving ourselves to something… ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=177))
- His wonder—that there is being and not nothing, that there is meaning (residing in truth, beauty, and… ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=180))
- There is hardly a word in the religious language, both theological and popular, which is subject to more misunderstandings, distortions and questionable definitions than the word “faith.” It belongs to those terms which need healing before they can be used for the healing of men. Today the term “faith” is more productive of disease than of health. It confuses, misleads, creates alternately skepticism and fanaticism, intellectual resistance and emotional surrender, rejection of genuine religion and subjection to substitutes. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=186))
- Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of man’s ultimate concern. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=199))
- If it claims ultimacy it demands the total surrender of him who accepts this claim, and it promises total fulfillment even if all other claims have to be subjected to it or rejected in its name. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=203))
- The extreme nationalisms of our century are laboratories for the study of what ultimate concern means in all aspects of human existence, including the smallest concern of one’s daily life. Everything is centered in the only god, the nation—a god who certainly proves to be a demon, but who shows clearly the unconditional character of an ultimate concern. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=205))
- “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (Deut. 6:5). This is what ultimate concern means and from these words the term “ultimate concern” is derived. They state unambiguously the character of genuine faith, the demand of total surrender to the subject of ultimate concern. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=217))
- Faith, for the men of the Old Testament, is the state of being ultimately and unconditionally concerned about Jahweh and about what he represents in demand, threat and promise. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=222))
- Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned. The content matters infinitely for the life of the believer, but it does not matter for the formal definition of faith. And this is the first step we have to make in order to understand the dynamics of faith. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=230))
- Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality. It happens in the center of the personal life and includes all its elements. Faith is the most centered act of the human mind. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=233))
- For faith is a matter of freedom. Freedom is nothing more than the possibility of centered personal acts. The frequent discussion in which faith and freedom are contrasted could be helped by the insight that faith is a free, namely, centered act of the personality. In this respect freedom and faith are identical. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=245))
- Faith is not an act of any of his rational functions, as it is not an act of the unconscious, but it is an act in which both the rational and the nonrational elements of his being are transcended. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=260))
- Faith as the embracing and centered act of the personality is “ecstatic.” It transcends both the drives of the nonrational unconscious and the structures of the rational conscious. It transcends them, but it does not destroy them. The ecstatic character of faith does not exclude its rational character although it is not identical with it, and it includes nonrational strivings without being identical with them. In the ecstasy of faith there is an awareness of truth and of ethical value; there are also past loves and hates, conflicts and reunions, individual and collective influences. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=262))
- “Ecstasy” means “standing outside of oneself”—without ceasing to be oneself—with all the elements which are united in the personal center. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=266))
- At this point it must be stated as sharply and insistently as possible that in every act of faith there is cognitive affirmation, not as the result of an independent process of inquiry but as an inseparable element in a total act of acceptance and surrender. This also excludes the idea that faith is the result of an independent act of “will to believe.” There is certainly affirmation by the will of what concerns one ultimately, but faith is not a creation of the will. In the ecstasy of faith the will to accept and to surrender is an element, but not the cause. And this is true also of feeling. Faith is not an emotional outburst: this is not the meaning of ecstasy. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=270))
- Faith precedes all attempts to derive it from something else, because these attempts are themselves based on faith. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=283))
- The word “concern” points to two sides of a relationship, the relation between the one who is concerned and his concern. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=288))
- Man is able to understand in an immediate personal and central act the meaning of the ultimate, the unconditional, the absolute, the infinite. This… ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=292))
- Human potentialities are powers that drive toward actualization. Man is driven toward faith by his awareness of the infinite to which he belongs, but which he does not own like a possession. This is in abstract terms what concretely… ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=294))
- the ultimate concern is concern about what is experienced as ultimate. In this way we have turned from the subjective meaning of faith as a centered act of the personality to its… ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=298))
- at this step we ask: What in the idea of God constitutes divinity? The answer is: It is the element of the unconditional and of ultimacy. This carries the quality of divinity. If this is seen, one can understand why almost every thing “in heaven and… ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=300))
- The term “ultimate concern” unites the subjective and the objective side of the act of faith—the fides qua creditur (the faith through which one believes) and the fides quae creditur (the faith which is believed). The first is the classical term for the centered act of the personality, the ultimate concern. The second is the classical term for that… ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=304))
- In terms like “ultimate,” “unconditional,” “infinite,” “absolute,” the difference between subjectivity and objectivity is overcome. The ultimate of the act of faith and the ultimate that is meant in the act of faith are one and the same. This is symbolically expressed by the mystics when they say that their knowledge of God is the knowledge God has of himself; and it is expressed by Paul when he says (I Cor. 13) that he will know as he is known, namely, by God. God never can be object without being at the… ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=311))
- This character of faith gives an additional criterion for distinguishing true and false ultimacy. The finite which claims infinity without having it (as, e.g., a nation or success) is not able to transcend the subject-object scheme. It remains an object which the believer looks at as a subject. He… ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=318))
- The nation is nearer to true ultimacy than is success. Nationalistic ecstasy can produce a state in which the subject is almost swallowed by the object. But after a period the subject emerges again, disappointed radically and totally, and by looking at the nation in a… ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=321))
- The more idolatrous a faith the less it is able to overcome the cleavage between subject and object. For that is the difference between true and idolatrous faith. In true faith the ultimate concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous faith… ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=323))
- What concerns one ultimately becomes holy. The awareness of the holy is awareness of the presence of the divine, namely of the content of our ultimate concern. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=334))
- The human heart seeks the infinite because that is where the finite wants to rest. In the infinite it sees its own fulfillment. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=340))
- The feeling of being consumed in the presence of the divine is a profound expression of man’s relation to the holy. It is implied in every genuine act of faith, in every state of ultimate concern. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=344))
- Faith is certain in so far as it is an experience of the holy. But faith is uncertain in so far as the infinite to which it is related is received by a finite being. This element of uncertainty in faith cannot be removed, it must be accepted. And the element in faith which accepts this is courage. Faith includes an element of immediate awareness which gives certainty and an element of uncertainty. To accept this is courage. In the courageous standing of uncertainty, faith shows most visibly its dynamic character. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=376))
- If faith is understood as belief that something is true, doubt is incompatible with the act of faith. If faith is understood as being ultimately concerned, doubt is a necessary element in it. It is a consequence of the risk of faith. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=402))
- Faith as being ultimately concerned is a centered act of the whole personality. If one of the functions which constitute the totality of the personality is partly or completely identified with faith, the meaning of faith is distorted. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=538))
- The most ordinary misinterpretation of faith is to consider it an act of knowledge that has a low degree of evidence. Something more or less probable or improbable is affirmed in spite of the insufficiency of its theoretical substantiation. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=541))
- Some things are believed because we have good though not complete evidence about them; many more things are believed because they are stated by good authorities. This is the case whenever we accept the evidence which others accepted as sufficient for belief, even if we cannot approach the evidence directly (for example, all events of the past). Here a new element comes into the picture, namely, the trust in the authority which makes a statement probable for us. Without such trust we could not believe anything except the objects of our immediate experience. The consequence would be that our world would be infinitely smaller than it actually is. It is rational to trust in authorities which enlarge our consciousness without forcing us into submission. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=548))
- we use the word “faith” for this kind of trust we can say that most of our knowledge is based on faith. But it is not appropriate to do so. We believe the authorities, we trust their judgment, though never unconditionally, but we do not have faith in them. Faith is more than trust in authorities, although trust is an element of faith. This distinction is important in view of the fact that some earlier theologians tried to prove the unconditional authority of the Biblical writers by showing their trustworthiness as witnesses. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=553))
- The Christian may believe the Biblical writers, but not unconditionally. He does not have faith in them. He should not even have faith in the Bible. For faith is more than trust in even the most sacred authority. It is participation in… ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=556))
- Therefore, the term “faith” should not be used in connection with theoretical knowledge, whether it is a knowledge on the basis of immediate, prescientific or scientific evidence, or whether it is on the basis of trust in authorities… ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=558))
- Faith does not affirm or deny what belongs to the prescientific or scientific knowledge of our world, whether we know it by direct experience or through the experience of others. The knowledge of our world (including ourselves as a part of the world) is a matter of inquiry by ourselves or by those in whom we trust. It is not a matter of faith. The dimension of faith is not the dimension of science, history or psychology. The acceptance of a probable hypothesis in these… ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=561))
- Almost all the struggles between faith and knowledge are rooted in the wrong understanding of faith as a type of knowledge which has a low degree of evidence… ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=565))
- The difference between faith and knowledge is also visible in the kind of certitude each gives. There are two types of knowledge which are based on complete evidence and give complete certitude. The one is the immediate evidence of sense perception. He who sees a green color sees a green color and is certain about it. He cannot be certain whether the thing which seems to… ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=569))
- The other complete evidence is that of the logical and mathematical rules which are presupposed even if their formulation admits different and sometimes conflicting methods. One cannot discuss logic without presupposing those implicit rules which make the discussion meaningful. Here we have absolute certitude; but we have no reality, just as in the case of mere sense perception. Nevertheless, this certitude is not without value. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=572))
- No truth is possible without the material given by sense perception and without the form given by the logical and mathematical rules which express the structure in which all reality stands. One of the worst errors of theology and popular religion is to make statements which intentionally or unintentionally contradict the structure of reality. Such an attitude is an expression not of faith but of the confusion of faith with belief. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=575))
- Knowledge of reality has never the certitude of complete evidence. The process of knowing is infinite. It never comes to an end except in a state of knowledge of the whole. But such knowledge transcends… ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=578))
- Every knowledge of reality by the human mind has the character of higher or lower probability. The certitude about a physical law, a historical fact, or a psychological structure can be so high that, for all practical purposes, it is certain. But theoretically the incomplete certitude of belief… ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=580))
- The certitude of faith has not this character. Neither has it the character of formal evidence. The certitude of faith is “existential,” meaning that the whole existence of man is involved. It has, as we indicated before, two elements: the one, which is not a risk but a certainty about one’s own being, namely, on being related to something ultimate or unconditional; the other, which is a risk and involves doubt and courage,… ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=582))
- Faith is not belief and it is not knowledge with a low degree of probability. Its certitude is not the uncertain… ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=588))
- One can divide this form of the distorted interpretation of faith into a Catholic and a Protestant type. The Catholic type has a great tradition in the Roman Church. It goes back to Thomas Aquinas, who emphasized that the lack of evidence which faith has must be complemented by an act of will. This, first of all, presupposes that faith is understood as an act of… ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=591))
- For instance, someone has doubts about the so-called “immortality of the soul.” He realizes that this assertion that the soul continues to live after the death of the body cannot be proved either by evidence or by trustworthy authority. It is a questionable proposition of theoretical character. But there are motives driving people to this assertion. They decide to believe, and make up in this way for the lack of evidence. If this belief is called “… ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=598))
- If the idea of grace mediated by the Church and motivating the will is rejected, as in pragmatism, the will to believe becomes willfulness. It becomes an arbitrary decision which may be supported by some insufficient arguments but which could have gone in other directions with equal justification. Such belief as the basis of the will to believe is certainly not faith. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=606))
- The Protestant form of the will to believe is connected with the moral interpretation of religion by Protestants. One demands “obedience of faith,” following a Paulinian phrase. The term can mean two different things. It can mean the element of commitment which is implied in the state of ultimate concern. If this is meant, one simply says that in the state of ultimate concern all mental functions participate — which certainly is true. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=608))
- Or the term “obedience of faith” can mean subjection to the command to believe as it is given in prophetic and apostolic preaching. Certainly, if a prophetic word is accepted as prophetic, i.e., as coming from God, obedience of faith does not mean anything other than accepting a message as coming from God. But if there is doubt whether a “word” is prophetic, the term “obedience of faith” loses its meaning. It becomes an arbitrary “will to believe.” ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=611))
- The demand to be obedient is the demand to be what one already is, namely, committed to the ultimate concern from which one tries to escape. Only if this is the situation can obedience of faith be demanded; but then faith precedes the obedience and is not the product of it. No command to believe and no will to believe can create faith. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=618))
- One should never convey the impression to those whom one wants to impress, that faith is a demand made upon them, the rejection of which is lack of good will. Finite man cannot produce infinite concern. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=621))
- Neither arguments for belief nor the will to believe can create faith. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=624))
- the word “feeling” has induced many people to believe that faith is a matter of merely subjective emotions, without a content to be known and a demand to be obeyed. This interpretation of faith was readily accepted by representatives of science and ethics, because they took it as the best way to get rid of interference from the side of religion in the processes of scientific research and technical organization. If religion is mere feeling it is innocuous. The old conflicts between religion and culture are finished. Culture goes its way, directed by scientific knowledge, and religion is the private affair of every individual and a mere mirror of his emotional life. No claims for truth can be made by it. No competition with science, history, psychology, politics is possible. Religion, put safely into the corner of subjective feelings, has lost its danger for man’s cultural activities. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=633))
- Emotion always expressed the involvement of the whole personality in an act of life or spirit. But emotion is not the source of faith. Faith is definite in its direction and concrete in its content. Therefore, it claims truth and commitment. It is directed toward the unconditional, and appears in a concrete reality that demands and justifies such commitment. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HG4RRY&location=648))
