### Highlights

- God chose to be incarnate in Jesus before there was any creation, because in Christ, God willed to be in relationship with us. Which means God’s intention to become incarnate in Jesus was the reason for creation. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=141))
- Jesus could not have come to fix the results of the fall – because God’s decision to become incarnate in Jesus was made before there ever was a fall.2 ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=143))
- every theory that elaborates upon the conviction that Jesus had to die to fix the problem of evil, sin and death misses the crucial revelation made three times in the New Testament itself: that was not why Jesus came. Jesus came to be with us in time so that we could be with him forever. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=146))
- It is not that sin is underestimated – it is that overcoming sin is too short a story, and one that insufficiently attends to God’s original and ultimate purpose. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=154))
- A church that claims to be able to determine who finds eternal life, by developing a particular theory of the atonement and by identifying what convictions and behaviours dovetail with that theory, is making an unwarranted bid for control – not just of human beings, but of divine purpose. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=157))
- church that perceives God’s original, unfolding and ultimate purpose as being with us in Christ redirects its attention to fostering relationships of being with God, one another and the creation as its principal form of ministry and mission. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=159))
- a church that understands its calling as living God’s future now will concentrate on modelling relations of trust, dynamism and wisdom and catalysing such interactions across all aspects of society, whether explicitly Christian or not. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=163))
- This is a theocentric story that centres God’s abundance, in contrast to the anthropocentric tendency of much theology, which introduces and comes to define God largely as the provider of the solution to human problems. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=171))
- It is a story whose beginning, middle and end are about Jesus, rather than one in which Jesus has a specific role to fix the human predicament. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=173))
- it is a story in which God’s means and ends are identical: there is no detour by which God achieves good things in a dubious way: God’s who is characterised by how as much as by what and why. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=176))
- Part of the task of the theologian is to pull strands together and highlight trajectories of thought, noticing correspondences and resonances and drawing inferences and interpretations – and then to set out thoughts in an ordered sequence that attends to the whole. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=181))
- I discern three forms that purpose takes: covenant, community and communion. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=186))
- What these themes have in common is that they are both means and ends: they model in temporal existence the character of eternal essence, being with God forever. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=187))
- The scriptural story is oriented towards God being with us so that we in turn might be with God, one another and the wider creation. Creation comes about because of God’s desire to be with us in Christ. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=193))
- being with is not a sweeping label or slogan but a textured, nuanced, scripturally founded and incarnationally rich notion describing not just the destiny of God’s purpose but the great part of the way God – and we – realise that purpose. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=201))
- Presence, attention, mystery, delight, participation, partnership, enjoyment and glory are all profoundly scriptural notions, found throughout the Bible, and constitute a fair portrayal of the ministry of Jesus. These dimensions ensure that being with is no abstract concept but a rich account of God’s inner-Trinitarian life and God’s life with us now and always. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=203))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- The first, stretching back to the earliest theologians such as Irenaeus but beginning in earnest with the seventh-century monk Maximus the Confessor, shares the conviction that Christ’s coming was not a reaction to the fall, but is generally much more focused on the eschatological aspects of the story, notably our deification by the Holy Spirit, and the insight into eternal life offered by Christ’s transfiguration. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=211))
- The second, most fully represented by the late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century Franciscan John Duns Scotus, asserts that the incarnation of Christ has primacy among all God’s purposes, and insists that Christ’s coming was not dependent on the fall. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=216))
- The third, clustering around the twentieth-century work of Karl Barth, especially his Church Dogmatics, recalibrates the old debates about election (that some are predestined for salvation, others for damnation), to suggest that election refers to Jesus Christ. Christ is not just the object of election (chosen by God); he is also, as a person of the Trinity, the subject of election (the God who chooses). ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=219))
- all the authors examined revert to a fairly conventional account of salvation hinged around Christ’s passion, death and resurrection; which puts my rendering of Christ’s cross in tension with all of them, and leaves me wondering if they truly uphold my key principle, the consistency of God’s means and ends. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=223))
- I explore the Holy Spirit, narrated through Israel, church and God’s realm. I understand the work of the Holy Spirit as making Christ present in these different spheres of God’s story. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=241))
- The project is one of relocation – from anthropocentrism to theocentrism, from a concentration on reversing the results of the fall to a focus on the coherence of God’s original purpose with incarnation, creation and eschatology. En route I make a case for a corresponding reading of scripture and reception of tradition. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=246))
- A consistent theme of the book is the degree to which I follow a number of Barth’s distinctive theological moves, yet seek to make major revisions in his characterisation of reconciliation and eschatology. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=266))
- There are two realms: essence and existence. Essence names that which is forever; existence names that which abides for a limited time. There need have been no existence. Essence is sufficient unto itself. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=285))
- Essence is constituted by three persons, so in one another that we call them one, so with one another that we call them three. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=287))
- When we consider their relations with one another, we call them Trinity; when we consider their purpose beyond… ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=288))
- God is characterised by these three persons being with one another in utter and mutual relationship. ‘Utter’ means they have no need or urge to look beyond themselves; these relationships are completely absorbing and rewarding, creative and fruitful. ‘Mutual’ means these relationships are entirely complementary, and there is no sense in which one party is more… ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=289))
- Yet in the mystery of these utter and mutual relationships, God chooses to be with another beyond these relationships, not because these relationships in any way fall short, but because God is characterised by effervescent abundance.1 This abundance emerges initially and principally in the Son, who in Jesus Christ is primed to participate in something beyond God: something called… ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=294))
- Only in the realm of existence, when the persons of the Trinity are given narrative display, can we begin to consider the story of God, and distinguish God from all there is. The Holy Spirit… ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=299))
- The purpose of existence is first of all to provide the theatre for the encounter between Jesus… ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=302))
- Jesus Christ’s encounter, while definitively an encounter with human beings, is truly an encounter with the whole of existence, with, through and beyond… ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=303))
- The detail and exquisite artistry of the living world is indescribable, and exceeded only by the extent and diversity of the universe beyond this planet. The billions of years before humankind began to dwell on earth and the elaborate process by which it came into existence likewise… ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=306))
- For all its detail and extent, existence is not essence. It does not last forever. It is the object of the Father’s attention, the scene of Christ’s incarnation, the sphere of the Holy Spirit’s activity: but it will… ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=308))
- in due course, God wills to elevate our life from existence to essence – to draw humankind and all creation into the forever that is the realm of God. This forever will not be entirely foreign to humankind, that is, so swathed in the utter and mutual relationship of God that no persons shaped by existence could recognise themselves in it; it will instead be a realm, for humans, of so being with God, themselves, one… ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=313))
- The language of the realm (or ‘kingdom’) of God identifies those moments when God’s original purpose in becoming incarnate, and God’s final purpose in transfiguring existence, become visible in social… ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=320))
- the community of people dedicated to modelling in its life the utter and mutual relationship of being with God, oneself, one another and the creation, and heralding this relationship as embodied in Jesus Christ and fostered by the Holy Spirit, is called church. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=400))
- Like any human activity, church cannot simply practise being with to the exclusion of other ways of relating. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=402))
- Whatever the elements of working for and working with, the telos of every activity is being with God, oneself, one another and the creation in truthful, reconciled and sustainable relationships of dignity, dynamism and mutual cherishing. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=407))
- The calibre of the church is the degree to which these communities exist – more than the number of communities seeking to claim the name ‘church’, or the number of individuals identifying with Jesus, or the influence those claiming to represent Jesus or church have over politics or society. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=409))
- While Christians long to be fully with God, and for their relationship with themselves, one another and the creation to be unsullied by the distortions, subversions and distresses of life in the world, they cannot assume that God’s final purpose will immediately be realised – either upon their own death or upon the conclusion of the earth’s story. For God may have many other stories to tell; the incarnation may be just one of God’s several ways of interacting with something beyond; and there may be some things beyond yet to appear: we are, after all, talking about eternity, in which this might be one of many universes and the wonder of the Christian gospel may be exceeded by yet more exhilarating manifestations of God’s glory. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=434))
- Christianity is, in the end, about a faithful God in whom we may place our utter trust. It is that, rather than any particular doctrine, that is the touchstone of all things. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=441))
- The anthropocentric story of the need to address the panic about the past (guilt and bitterness), and to dismantle the fear of the future (death and the unknown), unduly shapes, if not overshadows, the Christocentric story described above. Theology is consistently displaced by anthropology. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=450))
- alternative versions of Christianity tend not to focus on Jesus, for diverse reasons. Most often, they instead centre on sin. Sin and mortality become the key players in the story, and Jesus is introduced some while after the story has begun (around three-quarters of the way through, if one calculates by a scripture page-count). In such narratives, Jesus is not the centre of the story; instead, he has a clear job to do, a role whose responsibilities are not set by him: he turns out to be not the shepherd but a hired hand, brought in to fix the sin and mortality problem. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=456))
- there are other common ways of decentring Jesus. One is to highlight the eschaton, for example by portraying a rapture in which the faithful are taken up to heaven. The cost of overemphasising what lies ahead is to underemphasise what lies behind: the more dramatic and decisive is the climax, the less significant and definitive becomes the incarnation. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=460))
- One subtler way to decentre Jesus is to employ theological language, yet to offer no account of ways in which Jesus’ incarnation, passion or resurrection provide a template for discipleship and church today. Jesus quickly becomes a source of endorsement for whatever cause or initiative one planned to advance anyway. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=463))
- Working for is where I have skills and knowledge and configure a relationship in terms of my assets, which I exercise, and your deficits, which I alleviate. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=561))
- Working with is a collaboration in which I join a group of agents who each bring their assets to the table to overcome a problem together. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=562))
- Being with is where I relate to you for your own sake, not for any ulterior goal. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=563))
- Being for is where I do not directly interact with you but nonetheless advocate for you or consider myself to address your problem without engaging you in that pursuit. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=564))
- If the whole shape of the incarnation is determined by God’s decision to overcome nothingness, how can the incarnation be asserted as valid, with creation apparently as submerged as it ever was? This is of course a test for all atonement accounts; but particularly for Barth, who grounds his before the foundation of the world. ([Location 3980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=3980))
- if God’s ultimate purpose is to be with us and for us to be with ourselves, one another and the new creation, ‘nothingness’ is all that inhibits such relationships – unfortunately, through mischance; clumsily, through muddle; or maliciously, through malign, evil, intent. That which opposes God’s purpose is that which undermines being with, through dismantling trust, or precludes it, through death and discord, or poisons it, through evil and lies. ([Location 3987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=3987))
- It does not deny that evil, sin and death are still around, because it eschews the language of victory and conquest; instead it rests on the conviction that Christ in his cross is with us – and with God – even in the most separating, alienating, annihilating of circumstances. It is this withness that God embodied in the incarnation, sought in creation and will finally herald in the eschaton. It is this quality of being with that truly characterises the Trinity and determines the story of God. ([Location 3993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=3993))
- Moltmann makes a telling observation. Once the incarnate Son of God has achieved the reconciliation of the world with God, he himself becomes superfluous. … This is already inherent in the concept of the mediator; otherwise the mediator would stand in the way of what he mediates. Once creation has been redeemed, purified from sin and liberated from death, the God-man no longer has any place in it.’ ([Location 4025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=4025))
- Tanner’s account is a suitable place to conclude our investigation of modern developments, since she goes a long way to providing what I have been seeking: a truly incarnational theology within a broadly Barthian shape. She commendably avoids both making the incarnation dependent on the fall, and giving a soteriological account that betrays Christ’s incarnational nature. She also harnesses the Orthodox notion of participation to significant effect. ([Location 4076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=4076))
- face the defining question that it must answer, and through that answer to unfurl the full significance of incarnational theology. The question is, what happens when God’s purpose to be with us now and forever meets with a refusal? As we have seen, addressing the question of humankind’s alienation from God, itself and the wider creation is not, from the point of view of incarnational theology, the central dynamic of Christianity, as it is in conventional accounts. ([Location 6225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6225))
- Jesus does not ‘come to die’: yet in his death and resurrection he exposes the forces that oppose him and displays the dynamic that sent him and settles the only questions about existence and essence that ultimately matter. ([Location 6230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6230))
- Existing theories of the atonement are problematic in regard to incarnational theology for a number of reasons. Such theories tend to contravene the theocentric principle by placing human guilt and mortality, and consequently sin, evil and death, in the centre of the story. They are inclined to downplay covenant by airbrushing Israel out of the story: Israel’s only significant role is as a failed attempt to redeem humankind. (The blame is attributed to Israel, not to God.) It is a tendency of these approaches to undervalue community by focusing largely or entirely on humankind rather than the wider creation. ([Location 6241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6241))
- These theories can pay so much attention to overcoming individual guilt that in most cases they have no notion of any engagement with, participation in or transformation of society as a whole. Such theories tend to impoverish communion by concentrating on the rescue of individual human beings, with little or no account of what kind of eternal life they are destined for, other than that it is not damnation. They can be inclined to theorise in such a way that downplays or eradicates mystery. ([Location 6247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6247))
- In regard to the gospels, they can tend to disregard Jesus’ life and resurrection and concentrate solely on his death, making unclear what is the significance of the one who went to the cross. ([Location 6255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6255))
- by regarding the incarnation as subsequent upon the fall, every atonement account is likely to find itself in one or several of these unsatisfactory places. In short, atonement theories strive to address one problem but invariably end up creating several others. ([Location 6264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6264))
- one can perceive this only if one lets go of a goal Jesus needs to achieve and stops trying to fit the events of his passion into a preconceived (or foreordained) model of what salvation is and requires. ([Location 6267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6267))
- The purpose of this Trinity is to extend to creation the quality of being with that belongs to its inner-Trinitarian relationships. ([Location 6278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6278))
- Jesus is the way the Trinity extends its purpose of being with to humankind and the creation. Jesus models what being with entails in every aspect of his conception (Mary being with the Holy Spirit), birth (the Holy Family being with shepherds, magi, and the heavenly host) and ministry (being with the disciples, the crowds and the authorities). ([Location 6279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6279))
- First there are the disciples, whose lives are punctuated by moments of revelation ([Location 6285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6285))
- Second there are those who conspired against Jesus or colluded in his execution. These include the chief priests, the elders, scribes and Sanhedrin, Herod Antipas and Judas, together with the crowd gathered for the festival. Along with these are the bystanders who hurl ironic abuse at the crucified Jesus, and the closet supporters Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus. ([Location 6297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6297))
- Third there are the Romans: Pilate, the procedural bureaucrat exposed by the question ‘What is truth?’, the soldiers dragooned to whip and crucify and the ones moved by something deeper: Pilate’s wife, and the centurion at the foot of the cross. ([Location 6300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6300))
- The question is, can he continue to be completely with both the Trinity and humankind, given what he is facing? This is the dynamic at the heart of the passion account. The gospels have portrayed Jesus being utterly with both God and humankind to this point: that is the demonstration of God’s purpose. But can it continue, in the face of betrayal, denial, desertion, scheming, hatred, cruelty, violence and torture? ([Location 6309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6309))
- For the divine purpose to be opposed by humankind is not new; but for the divine purpose to be abandoned by God is confounding. Yet this is what Jesus is weighing in his mind and heart in Gethsemane. Meanwhile if Jesus can no longer be with God, the consequences are more devastating still. The Trinity is no longer the Trinity: the rupture between Father and Son cleaves the utter communion of with and creates a chasm of indescribable catastrophe. Thus Jesus’ agony in Gethsemane, and throughout the passion, is not just the conflict between his divine and human natures but his anguish in trying to be with the Father while still being with humankind and the creation. ([Location 6316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6316))
- To be at the mercy of such leaders is to dwell in a reality where truth has ceased to exist. Thus Jesus exposes how far creation in general and humankind in particular have strayed from the utterly mutual enjoyment of the persons of the Trinity. The forces that condemn Jesus represent the antithesis of with. It would be hard not to hear Jesus’ words as a wistful desire to rest in the simplicity of being with the Trinity without the demands and agony of being with creation and in particular humankind. ([Location 6329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6329))
- Luke is providing a comprehensive account of human failure – as if it were a painting where everyone’s expressions were frozen in time. Some actively sought Jesus’ death; some went along with it; some were under orders or threats; some watched; some ran away; some mocked. It is the full range of human reaction: no one escapes. All of them are part of the word ‘them’. ([Location 6345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6345))
- Sin is being intentionally without God, living as if you are your own god, using God for your own purposes or turning something inferior into your god, constructing a whole world around your own divinity or the divinity of what you have chosen to regard as your god, telling a false story to locate you in the right and justify your actions. ([Location 6354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6354))
- If sin is being intentionally without God, suffering is being without comfort. ([Location 6364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6364))
- If suffering is being without comfort, death is being without everything. It is being without breath – with no signs of life, no vital energy – crossing over from the animate to the inanimate – creation without spark. It is being without connectedness, with no sense of anyone or anything else, no with, no together, no senses. It is being without consciousness, without any mental faculty, without awareness, reflection, sense of self or others. It is being without a body, without physicality, without anything to recognise as oneself, without identity, without history, without future, without even the present.6 It is utterly not being – yet not ‘not having-been’, but ‘having been but utterly no longer being’. ([Location 6371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6371))
- But the greatest isolation is beyond even those. It is expressed in Jesus’ cry of dereliction: ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ (Mk 15:34). This is being without the Father, and thus being not-God – being without the with that is the very essence of God. ([Location 6379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6379))
- The Holy Spirit gives the dead Jesus its whole attention – the whole attention of one who coinheres and is in utter relationship even beyond death. The Holy Spirit enters the mystery of Jesus’ death and is undaunted by it – not because the Spirit has some formula or method practised a thousand times before elsewhere, but because this mystery calls upon the full depth and extent of the Trinity’s with-ness – its limitless togetherness and utterly mutual interpenetration (participation) and sheer delight. Out of that delight the Holy Spirit finds so much abundance that abides amid such loss and desolation, and discovers there is still more than enough relationship, more than enough mutual receiving, more than enough instigating and initiating to enspirit Jesus once again. This is the partnership of the Trinity working in a whole new way, facing a whole new challenge, but each person of the Trinity still being true to its distinctive character – not least that Jesus cannot move like the Spirit can move, and the Father cannot reanimate the Son until the fissure between them is healed – which only the Spirit can do. ([Location 6587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6587))
- Imagine the enjoyment as the risen Christ relishes the Holy Spirit like never before, and the rift with the Father is resolved, and Jesus can once again be with us with no damage to his being with the Trinity. This is unprecedented glory. ([Location 6597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6597))
- This is not a story about conquest or triumph. This is an account of the ultimate unbreakability of God’s being with us in Christ. God does not destroy death: God outlasts death, out-narrates death, finds resources within the Trinity that infiltrate the… ([Location 6600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6600))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- Jesus is raised to find a creation in which sin and evil are still evident: but one in which God’s will and resolve to be with us… ([Location 6604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6604))
- Among the many resurrection narratives the gospels offer, the most compelling is the simplest: Jesus’ encounter in the garden with Mary Magdalene (Jn 20:11–20). She is discovering two things: Jesus, despite all, is with her; and his purpose is to bring her and all creation… ([Location 6610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6610))
- The depiction of a man and a woman in a garden explicitly returns us to the moment in Genesis 3 when human beings are depicted refusing God’s offer to be with them, and jettisoning the opportunity to dwell in the perfection of being with God, one another and the creation in anticipation of doing so in the eschaton forever. In very brief, simple strokes, Jesus’ encounter with Mary offers the deepest Easter truth. In this… ([Location 6614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6614))
- There is no future for God that is not wrapped up in humanity and the creation, and there is no destiny for humanity and the creation outside the hands and the arms of God. Being with is here to stay. Life remains complex and it continues to be lived on the edge of death. But Easter shows humankind that it will never be alone. There is no humanity… ([Location 6618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6618))
- In the anthropocentric account, where first Israel is called and then Jesus is sent to be the way God resolves the shortcomings of creation after the fall, the ascension has very little… ([Location 6624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6624))
- The opening square bracket is Christ’s annunciation and nativity: the moment Jesus’ earthly life, the full relationship between God and humankind for which the universe was created, begins. The closing square bracket is Jesus’ ascension. This is the moment when Jesus’ earthly life ends. In other words, Ascension is the flipside of Christmas. And in the middle, between all those brackets, is the epicentre of God’s story: Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection. The crucifixion plays out the logic of the first two brackets, that being with us whatever happened would stretch God’s character and love and commitment to the very ultimate. The resurrection anticipates the logic of the last two brackets, that nothing can separate God from God, which we see played out in Christ’s ascension, and that nothing can separate us from God, which we see confirmed on the last day and the entry-point to heaven. That is what it means to see Good Friday and Easter Day as a microcosm of the whole history of everything. ([Location 6638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6638))
- At Christmas, God’s longing to be in relationship with us means that God in Christ becomes a true inhabitant of creation – still utterly God, but now fully dwelling in and with humanity. ([Location 6648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6648))
- at Ascension, humanity reaches out from time-bound existence into the forever of God’s eternal essence. ([Location 6650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6650))
- at Ascension, because Christ is fully human, he represents and embodies every single human being, every person that ever lived and ever will. When he is embraced into the whole of the Trinity, humankind is too. ([Location 6653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6653))
- Christmas means God forever belongs with humankind. Ascension means humankind forever belongs with God. Christmas is God in Christ reaching out to humankind. Ascension is humankind in Christ reaching out to God. At Christmas, Jesus embarks on the central definitive embodiment of God’s indelible relationship with us. At Ascension, Jesus disembarks from that definitive moment and brings humankind and creation with him into the heart of God. At Ascension, we discover that God takes humankind and the creation into forever: this makes Ascension a vital if neglected part of the gospel story. ([Location 6654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6654))
- After Jesus’ ascension, the Holy Spirit makes Christ present in creation in ways that remain true to the manner in which ([Location 6662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6662))
- There is a profound difference between the moment of Christ’s ascension, in which he brings humankind into forever, and the period after his ascension, in which he interacts in eschatological ways with humankind and the creation. The difference is that of dynamism and narrative: once the path into essence has been opened up by the ascension, humankind can enjoy beyond death the full experience of being with the Trinity, which the limitations of created existence hitherto inhibited. ([Location 6665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6665))
- The second coming of Christ is not a moment of opening out forever – that has been done in the ascension – but of sweeping the whole creation into that forever. ([Location 6669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6669))
- Sin and evil refer to those forces that inhibit being with – God’s being with us, and our being with God, one another and the creation. ([Location 6677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6677))
- Almost any interpreter of this narrative will infer beyond Eden to something Eden implies. The traditional implication is that existence came into being good, but early on became flawed – and that humankind was culpable in that. This account is difficult to reconcile with the story of the Big Bang and of evolution. ([Location 6682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6682))
- The story I have told above does not require resistance to the stories of the Big Bang and of evolution. God is not in a hurry: the likelihood that the universe is 14.8 billion years old, and that human beings have occupied it for only a tiny fraction of that time (starting at what is sometimes known as five minutes to midnight, when existence is portrayed as a clock), is not a problem to the story of God. But it is a problem to the traditional story of creation and fall. Where does the fall belong in a story in which most of the early running was made by astro- and geo-physical forces of immense magnitude and in which it is difficult to identify when human beings as we understand them first arose? ([Location 6685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6685))
- The trouble with such overwhelming accounts of the fall – expressed succinctly in the Calvinist phrase ‘total depravity’ – is that they so inflate the impact of evil and sin that it is hard to see how they will be anything other than perpetual adversaries. ([Location 6704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6704))
- The story of being with suggests an alternative that does not have God creating sin and evil, does not simply take refuge in their inexplicable origin and their perpetuation through God’s commitment to human free will, and does not verge on dualism. ([Location 6708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6708))
- Staying with Adam and Eve and the serpent, it notes that this is a story, and a story about a false story – the serpent’s false story that God has other purposes than being with Adam and Eve, that those undisclosed purposes are unfair and unjust, that they should not respect God’s terms of engagement, and should go ahead and eat the fruit without fear of death. ([Location 6710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6710))
- And this is the point that reveals why the Adam and Eve story is still so helpful to a notion of sin and evil, yet not in the way conventionally assumed. Their story is a story of how a false story ruins everything. Which is how sin works. Sin is a false story.27 It is fundamentally a false story about God: the serpent says, ‘You will not die’ (Gen 3:4), whereas God had said, ‘In the day that you eat of it you shall die’ (Gen 2:17).28 But it is subsequently and consequently a false story about ourselves, one another and the creation. ([Location 6720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6720))
- All of these are false stories. What they have in common is that they are too short. They lack the authenticity of the original story and the destiny of the final story. What they also have in common is that they inhibit, undermine, dismantle, obstruct and poison being with. It is that teleological damage, rather than any intrinsic deontological flaw, that makes them sinful. ([Location 6733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6733))
- What is false about these stories is that it is impossible to conceive of any circumstances in which the narrative they tell leads towards enhancing being with God, ourselves, one another or the creation. Instead, they put God, other people and creation on hold for as long as is required to fulfil their false telos – like a person saying, ‘Hold on a second’ before leaving a phone call for an indefinite period of time in order to pursue some other interest. ([Location 6736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6736))
- Sin will never succeed in ultimately distorting the story: that is what we discover on the cross – that God being with us will never not be the nature and destiny of existence and ultimately essence. But sin is capable of interrupting and obscuring that story for short or long periods. Thus to sin is literally to have lost the plot. ([Location 6740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6740))
- Sin consequently is a false story about ourselves, that we do not belong in this story; about one another, that other people constitute threats to our being with rather than assets and companions; and about creation, that we can use it to create an alternative story rather than enjoy it as it belongs with us in the being with story. ([Location 6749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6749))
- Where sin differs from evil is that sin is a false story about the real God – whereas evil is a truly malign story about a very different god, a story that substitutes destruction for flourishing, cruelty for tenderness, ruthlessness for mercy, chaos for companionship, and fear for hope. ([Location 6751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6751))
- sin and evil are conventionally located in relation to theological anthropology, as facets of the complex and flawed nature of humankind. But they might better be located in relation to revelation, because they are both perversions of the story by which human beings come to understand God’s call to be with the Trinity, one another and the creation. ([Location 6756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6756))
- We may think of four kinds of revelation. One is the apprehension of wonder, often beauty, in creation or in the configurations human endeavour can make of creation. A second is an immediate apprehension of a mysterium tremendum et fascinans, ‘a gentle tide pervading the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship’,32 a heart strangely warmed or an awareness of absolute dependence. A third kind is scripture, more straightforwardly understood – the story of how God has been made known and been understood in the life of Israel, Jesus and the early church. And a fourth is when the story of scripture comes alive in sacrament, service, solitude or the stranger. ([Location 6759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6759))
- Theological accounts of revelation tend to concentrate on the third kind. But what is unique about the third kind is that it is a story – and once God has committed the invitation to humankind to be with the Trinity to a story, that story can go in any number of directions, many of which become the pretext and justification for sin or evil. ([Location 6766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6766))
- Baptism is the public recognition of the renunciation of a story of alienation and the declaration of having been grafted into a story of being with God. ([Location 6769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6769))
- The Eucharist is the enactment of the true story of what it means to be with God. ([Location 6770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6770))
- the channels that bring us revelation are the same channels that bring us false stories. So it is not that God ‘allows’ free will or ‘plants’ sin to enable a great redemption. It is that inextricable from the true story are a host of false stories, some harmless but many profoundly damaging and destructive: and sin and evil arise in and out of such false stories. ([Location 6781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6781))
- How then are sin and evil dispelled? Not by a substitutionary death, not by a triumphant resurrection, not by a transformative defeat. ([Location 6785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6785))
- It is the church’s calling to live, to perceive, to tell, to witness to and to celebrate the true story – the story of God’s original desire to be with us.36 Every telling, living or celebrating of this story is the church’s attempt to dispel sin and evil. ([Location 6786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6786))
- The trouble with diverting from such an approach and seeking instead to destroy sin by punishment or evil by killing is that in the service of the story it departs from the story. Thus it breaks one of the principles of the story – that God’s means and God’s ends are identical – and in so doing risks itself communicating a false story. ([Location 6791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6791))
- The church’s aim is that its ends and its means should become as identical as God’s. Pentecost gives the church everything it needs to be so; but the church is as prone as anyone else to fall into the sin of following a false story, and is not immune to the evil of embracing a truly perverse and distorted story, as the experience of the German Christians who backed Hitler shows. ([Location 6798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6798))
- Sin and evil will abide as long as creation, until the eschaton, because the cost of abolishing them would be the abolition of stories, and without stories, humankind would never learn the story of God. ([Location 6802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6802))
- Death, as we have seen at the crucifixion, is the definition of being not-with; ([Location 6810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6810))
- suffering may so profoundly isolate that it makes being with almost impossible – but it may in some cases enhance being with, or be transfigured. ([Location 6811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6811))
- death is an unavoidable consequence of a finite creation. Eternal life is possible only in a condition of infinity: that is what essence is. It is God’s purpose to bring humankind and the creation into essence; but in existence, there must be death. ([Location 6813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6813))
- The ethic of being with is to perceive death not as a problem but as a mystery. As Jesus says, ‘It is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it’ (Jn 11:4). ([Location 6815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6815))
- the horror of death is nothing of which to be ashamed. Death does after all take away every aspect of being with – oneself, one another, the creation. Just as the Holy Spirit was taken to its utmost in raising Jesus from the dead, we imagine that drawing each one of us from existence into essence is no small enterprise. ([Location 6820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6820))
- Existence is an indescribable gift: the gifts of oneself, others, and creation each take far more than a lifetime to explore and enjoy. But it is not a permanent gift; perhaps it would not be the cause for such attention, delight and enjoyment if it were. ([Location 6823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6823))
- The real question is not, does death bring all these things to an end? It manifestly does. The real question is, does God’s being with us transcend death, and is with truly the most enduring feature of existence – indeed the presence of essence in existence and the part of existence that transfers into essence? The hope of Christianity is that it is and it does. ([Location 6824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6824))
- approaching death is not so much about postponing the inevitable for as long as possible, as if limitation were humankind’s greatest predicament; it is about fostering relationships of with, learning to be with oneself and the creation, and thus preparing to focus one’s whole being on being with God – and this in losing the whole world, as one does at death, nonetheless gaining true life with God (Mk 8:36). ([Location 6828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6828))
- We and God are ultimately inseparable: here is a succinct summary of the gospel of with. In Romans 8:28–39, Paul explores what it means for God and us to be inseparable. ([Location 6838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6838))
- God’s purpose is thus to make us and remake us to look like Jesus. There is nothing here about comfort, security or other blessings. But there is a lot about suffering. Most of the things we tend to feel deprived of are things Jesus did not have: healthy family, long and happy life, rewarding job, loyal set of friends, warm home, wholesome partner or quiverful of offspring. Meanwhile Jesus was homeless, rejected, betrayed, tortured and executed. For Paul, these are signs that things are good – that we are being conformed to Christ. ([Location 6848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6848))
- It turns out to be a list of the most gruesome of Jesus’ experiences and challenges. Paul is saying there is nothing we can go through that Jesus has not first gone through. (And Paul has been through most of these things himself.) Thus suffering is transformed into participation: almost communion. ([Location 6859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6859))
- The only thing missing from Paul’s list is any lingering sense that God is against us. Paul squashes any such suggestion: God is for us, not against us – Christ’s incarnation and death prove it. God is with us at every step, Jesus has faced everything we might possibly face, we were with God in the very beginning of all things, we are now, and we always will be, and being with God in hardship is always better than being separate from God in comfort ever could ([Location 6865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6865))
- Transfiguration can be an instant of glory, when essence appears in the midst of existence, forever is glimpsed in the middle of now, and faces appear more splendid than the sun. ([Location 6875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6875))
- Robert Jenson, in his Systematic Theology, vol. 1, 179, points out that his account of Jesus decentres the cross, in a way he finds also in Pannenberg, Moltmann and Kasper. If I decentre the cross, I do so by insisting that the cross can be considered only in close relation to and continuity with the whole sweep of God being with us as described in this book – something most atonement theories signally fail to do. ([Location 6886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6886))
- ‘He died as three times excluded: by the Jewish law of its tribal nation; by the Roman universal law of empire; by the democratic rule of the mob.’ Milbank, Being Reconciled, 96. We might add a fourth – excluded by his disciples. ([Location 6913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6913))
- It is important to note that what I am describing here is not kenosis, the self-emptying of the Son, nor patri-passianism, the suffering of the Father – two themes much explored in the tradition. This is about a rupture within the profound being with relations of the Trinity. To use a phrase from Sergei Bulgakov, this is the metaphysical Golgotha underlying the historical Golgotha. ([Location 6943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6943))
- Jüngel cites the notion of the vinculum caritatis, which preserves the unity of Father and Son despite their separation, although he does not suggest as I do that it is precisely the Holy Spirit that restores the relationship of Father and Son at the resurrection. Augustine’s notion, also known as vinculum amoris, is found in Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus. ([Location 6952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6952))
- follow Jürgen Moltmann and collapse the second person of the Trinity into the human subject Jesus. This entails a rift in the being of God, such that the Father is no longer the Father of the Son. ([Location 6973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=6973))
- My proposal is neither – not least because it does not set itself up as a doctrine of the atonement, since it rejects the premise that Jesus comes to reverse the fall, and thus, without denying the prevalence of sin and evil, eschews the language of salvation almost entirely. ([Location 7014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7014))
- See the discussion in my Humbler Faith, Bigger God: Finding a Faith to Live By (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, and Norwich: Canterbury, 2022), 27–53, where I suggest that the two theological questions concerning sin and evil are: (1) If Jesus ascended to heaven having completed his work on earth, why is there still evil? and (2) If, in the fullness of time, God will vindicate the oppressed, why does God not do so now? ([Location 7023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7023))
- I repeatedly emphasise that what is happening in Christ’s death is an ontological event within the Trinity, not simply or mainly any impression his death may leave on humankind. What I am questioning is why the whole gospel is conventionally understood as God’s fixing of the sin problem. I am suggesting instead that engaging sin is part of the context of the incarnation, and not its pretext or purpose. ([Location 7037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7037))
- While I have some sympathy for Abelard’s notion that Christ came to unite humanity to God in love, and the two unities noted here accord with my strategy in this book, this approach is still locked into a notion of the incarnation being dependent on the fall, and I do not believe that its account of love is as rich as the purpose and dimensions of being with. ([Location 7044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7044))
- T. F. Torrance insists there can be no ‘theory’ of the atonement: ‘The innermost mystery of atonement and intercession remains mystery: it cannot be spelled out.’ ([Location 7049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7049))
- Rowan Williams, in his On Christian Theology, 104–05, in seeking to articulate the limits of Christian claims in relation to Judaism and to other faiths, articulates this understated quality of the resurrection in quoting Jacques Pohier’s God – in Fragments, trans. John Bowden (London: SCM, 1985), 294: ([Location 7088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7088))
- One could say, in a rough paraphrase of St. Paul: We do not have omnipotence of meaning; we do not proclaim to you the totality of meaning; we have nothing to proclaim but Jesus dead and risen; we have only this news which has no value as a response to everything or as the totality of meaning, but has value in itself. ([Location 7097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7097))
- I am saying present and ultimate meaning and purpose are to be defined in relation to the Christ who, as cross and resurrection definitively show, will never not be with us. ([Location 7102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7102))
- Witt and Joel Scandrett make a helpful distinction between sin and sins. Sin refers to habitual human behaviour; notions of recapitulation and participation accordingly point to moral transformation, while victory language sees sin as a defeated enemy. ([Location 7120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7120))
- Sins refer to wrongs enacted, which cause guilt and offence, and require forgiveness and accountability. Stanley Hauerwas makes a similar distinction in his ‘“Salvation Even in Sin”: Learning to Speak Truthfully about Ourselves’, in Sanctify Them in the Truth: Holiness Exemplified (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1997), 61–74 at 62, where he speaks about coming from a revivalist culture of weekly repentance from one’s sins to a more sophisticated university milieu. ‘We were reschooled to say the problem is not sins, but sin. … We are left quite unsure what it means for us to be saved, much less made holy. As a result, we lose the ability to tell the truth about our lives.’ This resonates with my description below of sin as a false story. ([Location 7122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7122))
- Speaking of Dante’s Divine Comedy, Denys Turner, in his Julian of Norwich, Theologian (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2011), 92, notes, ‘Hell is the condition of those who do not repent of their stories, who refuse the offer of their revision by the divine love, and insist on living by means of the story that sin tells, the story of the attempt to achieve a self-made significance independently of the story of the divine love.’ ([Location 7136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7136))
- in Genesis 2:17 God says nothing about touching the fruit. Which illustrates how sinisterly sin and evil may infiltrate even a conversation pursued in innocence, since memory is so seldom capable of rendering a true story. Eve is relying on Adam’s memory, since according to the story Eve had not been created when God gave the injunction about the tree. So Adam is the first illustration of the link between a story being distorted on retelling and the way sin arises. ([Location 7144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7144))
- ‘Sin is how we exclude ourselves from reality by preferring to inhabit the self-destructive unreality of the story that sin tells, by refusing to allow ourselves to be told by the story of compassion that the divine love tells. … It is an attempt to place a nothing at the heart of the real.’ Turner, Julian of Norwich, Theologian, 98. ([Location 7149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7149))
- The notion of sin as a false story escapes what Robert Williams calls the twin problems of sin in modernity. Problem one is that sin is not regarded as part of human nature, because humans are regarded as created good; problem two is that sin is inherited and inevitable, yet humans are presumed to have freedom and autonomy. ([Location 7159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7159))
- A false story is in the water of existence; human beings may steer their way through and beyond it by learning and being conformed to a true story, but false stories are still everywhere. Thus we may be held responsible for acting in accordance with them, but this does not inhibit our created goodness or our freedom and autonomy.

- ‘The most terrible thing about the Holocaust was that even this event was brought about through a chain of seemingly “good reasons” – economic, cultural, scientific, peace-seeking – whose delusory appeal is unfortunately not alien to our common humanity.’ Milbank, Being Reconciled, 55, italics original. ([Location 7180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7180))
- John Milbank’s profound reflections on forgiveness are illuminating precisely because in his description of gift-giving he comes very close to imitating the language of being with. He regards charity less as a performance than as a state of fraternal, friendly and harmonious co-existence; we may say, an underdeveloped notion of being with.

- He goes on to say, ‘Charity is not an empty disposition … but the ontological bond between God and creatures … To forgive is to re-establish a reciprocity only possible as the attainment of a mysterious harmony through its participation in the divine infinite harmony.’ See his Being Reconciled, 57.

- That is not to say that the only form of truthful (Spirit-inspired) form of living takes place within the church. The Spirit inspires many forms of life beyond the church, as we saw in Chapter 9. But the church names the community in which truthful living in accordance with the revelation of God’s being with us in Christ is intentionally sought and specifically named.

- This was Bishop George Bell’s argument in the House of Lords against the carpet-bombing of German cities by the Allies in the Second World War: in order to defeat Nazism, they had made themselves as bad as the Nazis.

- My whole study is framed by the notion of story. The titles of each section of the book, together with those of the Introduction and of this Conclusion, nod to the unsubstitutable narrative character of experience and of revelation.

- a story in which the fall has a determinative role is incompatible with the repeated New Testament references to the election of Jesus before the foundation of the world – that is, before the fall. That is a statement about the status of the fall in the story. ([Location 7229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7229))

- The problem with notions of the ‘work of Christ’ (usually as distinct from the ‘person of Christ’) is that the whole configuration of the terminology presupposes the orientation of for. It thus incurs all the missteps of the assumptions of for.

- He is Immanuel, God with us. Then suddenly he is surrounded, arrested, assaulted, condemned, crucified. If he escapes to the Father now – if he withdraws, flinches or bolts – he has then detonated, demolished and discredited the whole story: the whole reason for creation, the whole destiny of eternity together, the whole purpose of the incarnation. If he cannot stay on the cross, even in the face of being abandoned by the Father, the whole initiative to be with us now and always is over. The cross is the ultimate test of whether God is serious about being with us. And what it shows in… ([Location 7272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7272))

- There is no downplaying of the cross in my rendering of the story: the cross is the definitive expression of God’s commitment to be with humankind and the creation. What does get less emphasis is an account of the cross that sees it as a device to secure a specific benefit for humankind. The cross is all about God, rather than achieving something for humankind.

- The fundamental thing about the cross is not that Jesus experienced physical agony and thus shows how much God loves us – the gospels make almost no reference to physical pain; instead it is the separation from the Father and the isolation from those Jesus is profoundly seeking to be with – those who betray, deny, flee, scourge and mock. ([Location 7301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7301))
- It addresses a deeper issue – what it means to be utterly adrift, either as a human being or as God; what it might mean for creation to come adrift from God or for one person of the Trinity to become adrift and isolated from another. The question is not how God’s ability (or inability) to suffer impinges on God’s capacity to save. The point is, the poignancy that the Trinity that is constituted by being with experiences the most profound form of being not-with, of being separated and isolated. It is not about inhibiting God’s capacity to do; it is about God willingly undergoing a direct threat to what it means for God to be.

- Jesus is not looking to die a martyr’s death. He is looking to be in solidarity with us until the very end. ([Location 7331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7331))
- It is not that Jesus had to die to save us. It is that, at the defining point in their lives, they had to risk death because this was who they were: they could do no other. ([Location 7334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7334))
- Chapter 10 includes three significant theological proposals. One is that the cry of dereliction constitutes a rupture in the Trinity that comes about because of God’s utter commitment in Christ to be with us. ([Location 7360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7360))
- The second is that the Holy Spirit remains with both the Father and the Son and in the resurrection binds the Trinity back together. ([Location 7363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7363))
- The third is that sin is more fundamentally a false story than a transgression, and this belongs more within a treatment of revelation than in one of theological anthropology. ([Location 7365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7365))
- I take the principle, enunciated in Chapter 1 but pervasive in the book, that God’s means and God’s ends are identical to be not a limitation of God’s freedom but a rendering of the trustworthiness and truthfulness of God. It presents the principal challenge to atonement theories. ([Location 7367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0DK8NHKKT&location=7367))
- A fuller treatment that reached into the sphere of theological ethics would explore how God’s desire to be with us, and the notions of covenant, community and communion, together with other gleanings such as conversation, could shape approaches to diverse and pressing topics such as artificial intelligence, social media and the fostering of democratic practices in a divided political age – in addition to treatments I have offered elsewhere.

- the story I’ve been telling in this book is a third arch, bigger still than the Eastern arch: one that stretches from Trinity to eternity. And I humbly suggest that though the Eastern arch is commendably bigger than the Western arch, the Eastern arch is still rather too much of an anthropocentric story, and is still too much tied to a God of for, whereas the third arch I’m describing is a theocentric story about a God of with.
