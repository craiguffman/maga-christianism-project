### Highlights

- Improvisation in the theater is a practice through which actors seek to develop trust in themselves and one another in order that they may conduct unscripted dramas without fear. Improvisation: The Drama of Christian Ethics is a study of how the church may become a community of trust in order that it may faithfully encounter the unknown of the future without fear. It is a treatment of how the story and practices of the church shape and empower Christians with the uninhibited freedom sometimes experienced by theatrical improvisers. It is an account of the development of trust in self, church, and God. In the process it is a renarration of Christian ethics, not as the art of performing the Scriptures but as faithfully improvising on the Christian tradition.

- Ethics cannot be simply about rehearsing and repeating the same script and story over and over again, albeit on a fresh stage with new players. This does not do sufficient justice to the unfolding newness of each moment of creation. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=90))

- The Bible is not so much a script that the church learns and performs as it is a training school that shapes the habits and practices of a community. This community learns to take the right things for granted, and on the basis of this faithfulness, it trusts itself to improvise within its tradition. Improvisation means a community formed in the right habits trusting itself to embody its tradition in new and often challenging circumstances; and this is exactly what the church is called to do.

- Ethics is not about being clever in a crisis but about forming a character that does not realize it has been in a crisis until the “crisis” is over. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=97))

- Improvisation is not about being spontaneous and witty in the moment, but about trusting oneself to do and say the obvious. The key to both ethics and improvisation is what the players regard as obvious, and thus the real issues in both lie in the imagination. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=99))
- In chapter 6 I reflect on status, a key notion in improvisation, and a neglected notion in Christian ethics. I suggest the benefits that consideration of status might make to writing on Christian ethics and offer humorous examples to demonstrate the significance and the universality of status transactions.

- In chapter 7 I describe perhaps the foundational notions in theatrical improvisation, those of accepting and blocking offers. I begin to suggest how these notions help to display the frustrations of much ethics in the contemporary context.

- Chapter 8 is a more theoretical chapter, less explicitly linked to specific practices in improvisation, but necessary to the argument because it explores the difference between gifts and givens, which is central to the subsequent chapter.

- In chapter 9 I outline the practice of overaccepting, in which a community fits a new action or concept into a larger narrative, into the greater drama of what God is doing in the world. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=106))
- Finally, in chapter 10, I introduce the second key practice, reincorporation. This is an eschatological practice in which discarded elements in the drama are woven back into the story, and it is particularly appropriate in relation to those whom Jesus’ Jubilee came to restore.

- It sees the principal role of Christian ethics as describing how Christians have formed habits by maintaining a tradition over centuries, largely embodied in written texts and in key practices, particularly the practices of worship. Christian ethics is not about helping anyone act Christianly in a crisis, but about helping Christians embody their faith in the practices of discipleship all the time.

- This is a constructive essay that values the place of the imagination in ethics.[3] It assumes that essential to a notion of the kingdom of God is a perception that things might be different from how they are. In other words, when a community is in Christ, there are no “givens,” no nonnegotiable facts about existence that one must simply accept, other than the great gift of the gospel.[4] To be a Christian is to see the gift of the gospel as one’s only given. This is whence the church derives its power. It is not constrained by a conventional “realist” list of “givens”; it exists in a wonderful moment of possibility, in the Easter moment of resurrection, when all things are possible but not all things, on this side of the eschaton, have yet happened.

- My hope is that the academy, the altar, and the marketplace will all find in this book a reason, an encouragement, and a method for exploring their theological imagination together. Hence I have carefully located my proposal within the contemporary academic discourse and used a minimum of jargon; but when justification for bolder claims is required, I have used the appropriate apparatus to support them. The use of both academic argument and accessible illustration is intended to draw Christians into conversation, to foster the discerning communities that the argument seeks to empower. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=165))
- The assumption of the argument—which is made explicit in chapter 13—is that the unit of Christian ethics, the “body” whose integrity and flourishing it seeks to promote, is not the individual or the world but the church. The body that matters is the body of Christ. The last thing this book is intended to make possible is the ability of the detached ironic observer to make pleasing patterns with the world’s stories and assumptions in order to support a clever disengaged superiority. The retreat into the indulgently cerebral is a denial of the incarnation; theological reflection must always be in a spiraling dialogue with embodied community.

- I see these practices of improvisation as true to the narrative of Scripture, and I have accordingly sought to illustrate my argument from scriptural stories and church history at every stage. Overaccepting is at the heart of the incarnation and the resurrection; reincorporation is at the heart of the parousia and the kingdom of God; status transactions are all over narratives like the Joseph saga and Jesus’ passion; forming habits is what Paul’s letters are constantly appealing to his readers to do.

- I see the biggest danger in the use of the Bible in ethics in the church is to make it some kind of Gnostic system of law or philosophy, which exists primarily in the mind of the believer and in the believer’s personal life of devotion. The practices of improvisation I see as helpful because they foster a process of communal discernment and practice, and it is this, rather than written documents, that I see as the heart of the church’s life. In other words I see the Bible as making the conversation that is Christian ethics possible, rather than concentrating on command and making conversation impossible.

- I confess a certain frustration that, when a constructive interest in improvisation is taken, attention often quickly focuses on preaching. Preaching is a vital aspect of worship, and is an important practice in the shaping of the church. But to focus on the preacher as the one who improvises on the scriptural text is to miss two significant dimensions that this study seeks to highlight. One is that improvisation is not primarily about words: the first two practices I note, forming habits and assessing status, are not primarily cerebral or verbal practices. The second is that improvisation is a corporate activity: preaching always presupposes a period of corporate discernment and embodiment, which in most church services lasts little longer than the time it takes for the preacher to return to the stall. This study considers that process of corporate discernment and embodiment as central to the mission and worship of the church. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=220))
- In my previous chapter I criticized what I described as the “Gnostic” temptation. This is the temptation to regard the interactions with other disciples that make up the routines and practices of community as either tiresome interruptions of the seamless individual experience or unnecessary trappings of the pure doctrinal knowledge that are often taken to be the heart of Christian identity. The reason why a narrative understanding of theology is inadequate to describe the life of the community of faith is that it remains open to such a Gnostic interpretation. The narrative—notwithstanding its many blind alleys, false prophets, unresolved tensions, and inconsistent outcomes—may still become a “secret knowledge.” Such a treatment is flawed because it can be a “secret” that the church perceives itself to have as a means of making itself superior to the world (as a talisman of salvation); and it is misguided in that it can be a “knowledge” that inhibits embodiment and becomes a substitute for action.

- Theological ethics requires the written text, but is not limited to the written word. It assumes interpretation, but can never be just a verbal matter, written or spoken. It inevitably involves the organization of interpretation and its structuring into doctrine, but this exercise must always be a support to something else, not an end in itself. That something else is the embodiment of the text, the events it describes, its interpretation and systematic construal in the practices and performance of the community. This is a dynamic, spiraling process of constant repetition, reinterpretation, transfer, and restoration of meaning, of things never being the same again and other things being rediscovered, ever new. It is what happens when words leave the page, when thoughts leave the mind, when actions ripple through other lives and cause further actions and further thoughts. It is what happens when narrative becomes drama.[1] ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=693))

- The theologian who has given most consideration to the notion of theology as drama is Hans Urs von Balthasar.

- The lyric perspective accepts that a profound narrative is almost bound to have a significant impact on the storyteller. If the observer is genuinely close enough to see events as they unfold, he or she will probably have a deep personal investment in their outcome, or will at least have found that the story has far-reaching resonances with aspects of the observer’s own character and experience. The fact that the narrator is so close to or almost becomes part of the story makes the… ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=711))

- My friend, in contrast, displayed the dramatic dimension. My tension, as her guest, was in watching her feel involved in all the different points of view, yet try to maintain her identity, her integrity, her own ability to tell a coherent story. While the news from Britain demanded thought, and my friend’s granddaughter’s reaction demanded feeling, my friend’s predicament demanded involvement, dialogue, response. As she was embraced by the story, one could not help but enter the story with her. This was not just a story, nor was it, by contrast, a story primarily about her: but it was a story in progress, in which she saw herself as a participant, albeit not a central one. Her perception of the events in Jerba quickly moved her to action—not just a reaction, but a life quest involving identity and sacrifice. The point at issue here is not the appropriateness of her response but its genuineness, its imaginative participation, and its effect on the observer.

- Von Balthasar points out that the epic perspective is inadequate as a mode of theological discourse. It talks of key events as finished and completed. The Eucharist becomes a memorial of an event, rather than an event in itself. God is a third person subject, and individual action is always governed by a deeper force, above and beyond the particular agent. Epic can see it all from the perspective of a disinterested observer. It tells a story that draws out the significance of events for a wider, perhaps universal context. In this sense, the epic perspective is neither possible nor desirable. It is not possible because reality is much more contingent, and perception much less detachable, than the epic point of view assumes. Epic tells a story, but not a story that resembles the world as it is, nor the world that is part of God’s story. It ignores the absurdity of a detached account of God, as if one had a broader view than God has. It is not desirable because judgments involved in detached perception tend not to provoke or inspire appropriate involvement.

- Von Balthasar is equally clear when it comes to the shortcomings of the lyric mode. For lyric, reality is not so much total objectivity, but intimate subjectivity. Experience and expression are the key, and objective fact and reality are secondary. Lyric lends itself to a spirituality that imaginatively engages with past events, that speaks with Christ on the cross, touches his wounds, and experiences the Eucharist as a living sacrifice of power and passion. Heart speaks to heart, not head to head. But, like the epic perspective, the lyric mode is inadequate in its perception of the world and in its apprehension of God. In relation to the world it is exaggerated in its perception of the self-importance of what is, in the end, a creature. In relation to God, it mirrors Greek… ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=753))

- Von Balthasar’s notion of drama brings together the internal intentions and dispositions of acting characters with the external events and deeds of the story. Thus he synthesizes the subjectivity of lyric with the objectivity of epic. The apostolic witness is one whose life and faith speaks to believer (lyric) and unbeliever (epic), and whose experience of God’s prior action becomes part of the testimony. The authors of the New Testament write as apostolic witnesses in this dramatic mode. Mark writes in the wake of the women’s ironic silence as they leave the empty tomb with the good news. Paul writes as one who has been met on the Damascus road and assumes that others will likewise be met on their journeys. As other authors have pointed out, drama offers a new way for theology to engage with time. Lyric… ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=760))

- It will have become apparent to the reader that there are significant similarities between von Balthasar’s notion of epic and my description in the last chapter of the aspirations of “universal” ethics. There are corresponding similarities between von Balthasar’s understanding of lyric and my description of some of the commitments of “subversive” ethics. What I described as the “Gnostic” temptation can be seen, in the light of the foregoing treatment of von Balthasar, as the temptation to avoid the vicissitudes of time by reverting to inner lyric experience or overarching epic truth. What is needed is a truly dramatic theological ethic, one that incorporates von Balthasar’s commitment to a synthesis of lyric and epic, while genuinely embracing time as a friend, and therefore reinstating the practices of the church and the significance of the present. This is what I now seek to describe. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=798))

- There are two kinds of mistakes that can easily be made about this five-act drama. These two mistakes hint at a substantial, if by no means comprehensive, description of sin. The first, lyric, mistake is to think one is in a one-act play rather than a five-act play. The world—if by that broad designation is meant all that has taken God’s freedom not yet to believe—thinks it is in a one-act play. In a one-act play, all meanings must be established before the curtain comes down. This life is all there is: heritage has no logical value other than insofar as it contributes to fulfillment in this life. All achievements, all results, all outcomes must be celebrated and resolved before the final whistle. The myth of human fulfillment, the stretching of human capacity to its utmost and the filling up of the resultant space with experience and reward, means everything must be squeezed into the unforgiving span of a single life.

- The five-act drama, in its epic dimensions, means that Christians are spared such a crisis. They are not called to be effective or successful, but to be faithful. Faithfulness is but effectiveness measured against a much longer timescale: since Act Three has happened and Act Five is to follow, Christians can afford to fail, because they trust in Christ’s victory and in God’s ultimate sovereignty. Their faithful failures point all the more to their faith in their story and its author. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=898))

- The second mistake is to get the wrong act. This is still a lyric step, since it generally overemphasizes one’s own role in the drama. If one assumes one is in Act One, one places oneself, rather than God, in the role of creator. There have been no significant events before one’s appearance in the drama. There is no experience to learn from, no story to join, no drama to enter. This is the desire for independence, to be a self-made individual. No one else’s rules have validity: everything must be discovered, named, assessed for oneself. Similar is the assumption that one is at the end of the story. This is as much the case in the church, thinking it is in Act Five, as in the world, taking itself to be near the end of a one-act play. On the great debating points of church order, people talk as if Jesus and the early church lived an eternity ago, and that they set everything in stone. But what if Jesus lives today, and the church still has thousands or millions of years ahead of it? Perhaps we are the early church, still haggling over the details, and rightly so. On nuclear weapons people similarly assume that they are near the end of the story. Blowing up the world would indeed be terrible. But the five-act drama proclaims that humanity has already, in Act Three, done the most terrible thing… ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=902))

- Similar mistakes lie within Acts Two and Three. The mistake of assuming one is in Act Two is to behave as though the Messiah had not yet come. Yes, one is a member of a special people, called by God; but no, God has not yet revealed the definitive way in which he encounters his people and in which he moves in the world. Thus one can be moved to sacrifice others, or oneself, in order to change things, rather than recognize that Christ has made the sacrifice instead. This tendency is particularly common on questions of peace and war. God is on our side, yet the other side appears to be winning, or at least posing an intolerable threat: therefore, so that God’s will may prevail, we must destroy the other side, or at least teach them a lesson. The fact that the Messiah has come, and has shown how God… ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=913))

- If the context is taken to be Act Three, it is easy to confuse one’s own role with that of Jesus. Everything one does then has decisive significance for the world—and even for God. This is the tendency I described in the previous chapter of seeking to be a hero rather than a saint. The roles of the Christ and the disciples are paradigmatically displayed in the story of the feeding of the five thousand. The disciples find the food, distribute it, and clean up afterward: but it is the Christ who transforms the poverty of their resources by the riches of his grace and gives his people everything they need. To take on the role of Jesus, rather than enjoy being a disciple, is to assume one lives in Act Three. This point of view is always fashionable—everyone likes to think they live in significant times. But the shape of the five-act play reminds the church that it does not live in particularly significant times.

- Status interactions are the ways people try to maneuver conversations and interplays into forms that reaffirm their preferred mode of relationship. Behind every status interaction is an implicit incipient story, and in many ways status names the negotiation over what kind of story this might become. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1465))
- Status is a seesaw. If people bring themselves up, they bring the other person down. If they bring themselves down, they bring the other person up. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1480))
- But the next dimension emerges when one discovers that status is not given or bestowed by another, but chosen by oneself. Even more significant is to appreciate that one kind of status is neither “better,” nor more admirable, nor more worthy than another. Christian communities that, at least tacitly, assume that meekness and servility are fine aspirations can be slow to appreciate this. But a crucial breakthrough in improvisation comes when actors realize that high and low status are simply alternative methods for getting one’s way—for arranging a social interaction along lines that one can subtly control and manipulate. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1500))
- Three technical terms may assist in exploring what it means to say “Yes.” The first is the term “offer.” Anything an actor does may be regarded as an offer. An offer may be a speech, a facial expression or gesture, or an action—even an attempt to remain silent or still. Any of these things may be treated as an invitation to respond, and thus be treated as an offer. ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1819))
- The second term is “accept.” An actor accepts an offer by any response that maintains the premise of the action that constituted that offer. ([Location 1823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1823))
- The third term is “block.” Imagine ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1830))
- Blocking prevents the action from developing. It undermines one’s partner’s premise. It may be amusing to watch, but it kills the story. It happens when one actor is overwhelmed by the danger or difficulty of keeping the story going. Accepting sees the future as an opportunity—blocking sees the future as a problem. All sorts of possibilities are ruled out by blocking. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1833))
- What would it be like to be committed never to block, always to accept? What would it be like to be surrounded by people who are committed to the practice of accepting all offers? The interactions in such a community seem telepathic. It looks like everything has already been arranged. There is no such thing as an accident or an interruption. Everything becomes an offer that can be accepted. ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1839))
- But it turns out that the ability to accept all offers, to enjoy even moose turd pie, gives the second trapper all the power he could wish for. ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1853))
- Accepting offers is a practice that builds community by acknowledging, encouraging, and accommodating the other. It recognizes the dependence of all parties concerned upon one another. It requires the sharing of space and implies a continuing conversation about how to go on doing so. It shares time and assumes only the kind of outcomes that can benefit the other. It is not a competition that is about winning and losing. ([Location 1868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1868))
- Blocking undermines the other. It refuses to share space and time. It denies outcomes from which all can benefit. It assumes rivalry and enacts conflict in which there cannot be two winners, and most often all are losers. It is at least subtly, and sometimes overtly, aggressive. It presumes violence. The times when the church is tempted to block are exactly the times when it is called to deny itself, take up its cross, and follow Christ. For this response, the way of the cross, was Christ’s engagement with evil, and his temptations to block were at least as strong as those of the church. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1871))
- The choice of blocking can therefore be either passive or active. It is either a choice to shut oneself away and keep oneself unsullied by the world, or it is a choice to take up arms. These are theological choices. The passive choice represents a denial of the goodness of God’s creation. It represents a refusal to engage with the complex realities of Christian discipleship. It reflects a denial of the redemption of all created things in Christ’s resurrection. It speaks of an absence of hope. It forgets that it is not what goes into a person that defiles, but what comes out of a person. It presumes that abundant life can grow in a heaven of one’s own making—and it assumes that heaven has walls, locks, and barricades. ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1876))
- The active choice is the choice of violence. This choice makes significant assumptions about God’s power and about the church’s power. The assumption it makes about God is that he has not already acted, that Christ has not already decisively defeated evil in his life, death, and resurrection. Thus the church acts as if it were Israel, in Act Two of the great drama, waiting for God to rend the heavens and come down, and in the meantime striving to secure his kingdom by all means possible. And sometimes the church acts as if it were in Act Five, taking upon itself the task of judgment, and assigning to itself the responsibility to impose the kingdom. ([Location 1881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1881))
- There is an assumption that the church is a high-status institution that can select one from a number of options about how to respond to a given offer. But it is more likely that it can only choose between more or less desirable ways to accept. ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1890))
- A further assumption that violent blocking makes is that if the future is not made to come out right, it will certainly come out wrong. A commitment to accept opens a much greater time perspective. For a church operating in Act Four of the great drama, no blocking gains permanent security, and no acceptance incurs decisive damage. One set of alternatives illustrates this longer view. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1893))
- The key word in learning to accept is the word “and.” This small word constitutes a significant statement. It indicates that the sentence is not yet finished. The story is not yet over. There is more to come, even when evil has done its worst. It begins to place the offer one is moved to block into a larger context in which it could be accepted. If one is able to face up to a threat, stare it in the face, and say “And . . . ?” one has gone a long way toward disarming that threat. ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1910))
- When the church is able to face the threats of the world with the same “And . . . ?” it gains extraordinary moral power. ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1918))
- When the church says “And . . . ?” it is faithfully imitating Christ. It is in this faithful imitation that the church finds the power to confront the threats of the world without being intimidated. ([Location 1921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1921))
- Blocking appears to some as faithful resilience. But in that it buries its talent in the hillside it may anticipate the punishment handed out to the third slave; and in that it sets its stall against the inevitable tide of time, it may anticipate the heritage of King Canute, the eleventh-century king of England who notoriously (and legendarily) sat at the seashore and ordered the tide not to come in. I have argued that for the church to block is not desirable, necessary, or possible. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=1968))
- The key emerges again as the ability to receive, to accept the offer, to keep the story going, to resist the temptation to block. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2001))
- Ethics, on this sober estimation, is not about receiving gifts but about negotiating givens. These givens are generally taken to constitute the boundaries of ethical debate. They are like a host of rival superpowers, occupying huge tracts of the globe and threatening the well-being of all who come near their borders. Christian ethics occupies the precarious space between the territories claimed by these competing “givens.” Each of these givens places limitations on human and creaturely existence—providing ample reason to block or at least to suspect any offers that might come one’s way. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2005))
- The name of Reinhold Niebuhr has come to be identified with the perception of Christian ethics as the clash of competing givens.[4] ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2032))
- Niebuhr then attempts to save Christian ethics by appending it to a largely Stoic understanding of natural law. Stoicism perceives that there is an absolute spiritual ideal that is constantly trying to bring order to a chaotic, finite world. Niebuhr adopts this pessimistic way of seeing nature and finitude and presumes an original imperfection that humanity sets out gradually to remedy. ([Location 2035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2035))

- Stanley Hauerwas underlines the way that Niebuhr’s stoicism, far from making him the true exponent of Christian realism, jeopardized his whole claim to be a Christian theologian at all. In his hands theology became ethics, and ethics became about sustaining liberal social orders in a Stoic fashion. ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2045))
- Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized version of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance. . . . [Niebuhr became] the theologian of a domesticated god capable of doing no more than providing comfort to the anxious conscience of the bourgeoisie.[6] ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2049))
- Milbank perceives that Christianity requires a distinct reading of history. Christians may sometimes see the same historical reality as other people. But they do not take these processes as final, or determined—as “given.” Milbank illustrates the way Christianity has exposed features of secular history as anything but natural and given: he cites Augustine’s demonstration that Roman justice, which claimed to be restraint of chaos, in fact depended on “the arbitrary coercive power of freemen over slaves, Romans over strangers.” The ultimate error of Niebuhrian realism lies in the assumption that there is “some neutral ‘reality’ to which Christians bring their insights.” On the contrary, insists Milbank, “There is no independently available ‘real world’ against which we must test our Christian convictions, because these convictions are the most final, and at the same time the most basic, seeing of what the world ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2056))
- What is emerging in my argument is a distinction between the given, on which ethics is often taken to be based, and the gift, on which I am suggesting ethics should be based. ([Location 2143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2143))
- What I am suggesting, by contrast, is that the only given is God’s story, the theo-drama, the church’s narrative: all else is potentially gift. It is not therefore a question of putting oneself in a position of power. Ethics is not principally about how to do the giving. God is the only true giver. His story of how he deals with his people is the definitive given. Ethics is done by people who are on the receiving end, working out how to accept things that present themselves as givens but cannot be since there is only one given—the narrative of Scripture and the church’s tradition. ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2208))
- The process I am describing can therefore be seen as threefold: first, recognizing that much of what seems given is in fact gift; second, realizing that the key to a gift is not its intrinsic nature or purpose but how the receiver responds and accepts it; and third, receiving the gift in such a way that it becomes part of the continuing story of the way God deals with his people. Thus is fate (a given) transformed into destiny (a gift) by placing it within a larger story. ([Location 2214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2214))
- Whose fault is the inappropriate gift? Is it the giver’s fault if the gift is quickly despatched to the garage or the attic—or is it the receiver’s failure to find a use for it, albeit perhaps one quite different from the giver’s intention? ([Location 2227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2227))
- My argument is that it is the receiver’s responsibility to find a use for the gift, rather than the giver’s responsibility to ensure the gift is appropriate, and that the church finds itself more often in the role of receiver than of giver.

- if the church improvised faithfully it would aim to accept all offers. But clearly not all offers are good. Indeed some are evil. So accepting all offers seems a dubious tactic. The question is, how does one maintain one’s integrity without blocking? As I have already suggested, blocking is subtly aggressive and undermines the space of the other. It may also depend on a level of force that may not be available or desirable. But accepting indiscriminately seems naïve to say the least. I want to suggest a third tactic, called overaccepting. ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2231))
- This changes the whole notion of what constitutes a mistake. As one experienced director puts it, “Mistakes are re-evaluated as possibilities of new directions. . . . Rightness is more a question of attitude, not of what you do but of how you do it, whether you are prepared to play with what comes along.”[1] The key word here is “play.” “Play” describes what happens when the actors are relieved of the responsibility of making the drama “come out right.” They no longer have a limited set of possible outcomes at which they must force the story to arrive. They can therefore begin to enjoy the story and not determine the dra ma. This is what I described in an earlier chapter as the opportunity given to the church by discovering that it lives in Act Four of God’s drama. It no longer has to assume that it must make the story “come out right.” God will deal with that in Act Five. The church is therefore free to play. ([Location 2238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2238))
- The attempt to exclude from the story any material other than that which is relevant for arriving at the goal is a strategy of management and, like all strategies, in the end relies on force. A tactic that has no power to exclude the detours learns to enjoy them, learns to regard them as significant parts of the story—learns to be able to say “Thank you” for them. It learns to regard them as a gift, and in the process, it learns to play. ([Location 2257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2257))

- The key is not to think of interesting things to give, but to concentrate on making the thing one is given as interesting as possible. If A simply holds out two hands, as if proffering something in a box, B may be delighted to receive an array of possible gifts: “Everything you are given delights you. Maybe you wind it up and let it walk about the floor, or you sit it on your arm and let it fly off after a small bird, or maybe you put it on and turn into a gorilla.”[4] If the game is played this way, the stifling sense of competition disappears, and great joy and energy are released.

- Ethics as it is generally described is invariably perceived as a matter of choosing when to say “Yes” and when to say “No.” But the Presents game shows that there is more to ethics than simply yes or no. In fact person B has three options when offered a present by person A. B can say, first, “No, I am not going to receive this gift.” This is a straightforward block. Saying “No” appears, in the short term, to maintain one’s own security. This is the approach associated with the Essene sect of first-century Palestine. Throughout Christian history there have always been groups that said “No” to some or all gifts that came their way from wider society. The Amish may appear to outsiders to represent this position today. There are many things to which it is often said the wider church should say “No.” The lists sometimes include slavery and murder, often nuclear weapons and embryo research, perhaps… ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2278))

It is not a question of what the gift is supposed to be: it is a question of what the gift can be. One does not say, “What is this gift for?”—and even less, “Is this a good gift?”; one says, “How can this gift be understood or used in a faithful way? What does the way we accept this gift say about the kind of people we are and want to be?

- Perhaps the best known overaccepting routine is the Monty Python “Four Yorkshiremen” sketch, in which the four men’s conversation over a drink descends into a relentless competition of inverted snobbery, as each man’s tale of childhood deprivation is overaccepted with the words “You were lucky.” ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2314))
- The story is told of a concert pianist who was on the point of beginning a performance when there was a scream from the audience. A child had left her seat beside her parent and was running around the auditorium. The concert pianist stepped away from his instrument in order to maintain concentration. The child ran up the steps onto the stage, sat herself down on the stool, and began to play discordant notes at random as she pleased. The hushed audience gasped in horror and embarrassment. The pianist walked toward the child and stood behind her as she played. The pianist leaned over her and, without disturbing her, placed right and left hands outside her two small hands on the keyboard. The pianist then began to play in response to her notes, weaving their discordant sounds into an improvised melody. To have thrown the child out would have been to block: to have let her play on would have been to accept; to weave a wonderful melody around her was to receive her as a gift, to overaccept.[6] ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2317))
- What overaccepting opens up is a whole approach to nonviolent response by a Christian community schooled in the scriptural story. When the Christian community is faced by offers coming to it from the society in which it lives, it overaccepts in the perspective of a story that stretches from creation to eschaton—a far larger story. The method has much in common with what John Milbank describes as Christianity’s ability to “outnarrate” all secular narratives. He narrates a “larger story” that stretches from creation to eschaton. The key to the Christian story is “the coding of transcendental difference as peace.” This is based on an understanding of the Trinity itself as social, and embodying harmonious difference. Thus creation is peaceable; meanwhile salvation, “the restoration of being,” and eschaton together depict the “sociality of harmonious difference.” In the light of this larger story, the offer (as an improviser might call it) of violence is always “a secondary willed intrusion upon this possible infinite order (which is actual for God).”[9] In this way Milbank shows how even the most unacceptable offer—violence—can be overaccepted in the light of the larger story.[10] ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2348))
- But many offers are challenging, threatening, and urgent: the “sectarian passivist” response would be to block, while the “responsible realist” approach might be to accept without reservation.

- The first temptation, “command these stones to become loaves of bread” (Matt. 4:3), is the desire to be independent of the grace of God, to have food on demand and one’s future secure—something Israel had always wanted. Jesus of course says “No” to the gimmick. But he says “Yes” to bread, overaccepting it in the words “This is my body, broken for you,” and “I am the bread of life.

- Its theoretical basis was derived from the New Christendom ecclesiology of the French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. For Maritain the key New Testament text is Jesus’ instruction to render to Caesar that which is Caesar’s and to God that which is God’s. Thus Jesus affirmed the autonomy of the temporal and the superiority of the spiritual. What this means in political terms is that the church holds sway over an interior, mystical realm while leaving the body to the state. Maritain aspires to a “New Christendom,” a new and truer Christian culture independent from the church, yet imbued with the Christian spirit. ([Location 2852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2852))
- The emphasis on the mystical quality of the body renders the church invisible. The key to the problem is the distinction of planes, the separation of the temporal from the spiritual—which rests on a still more fundamental mistake, the distinction of body and soul. Cavanaugh has no doubt that this is from beginning to an end a matter of the definition of the political, which rests not on Constantinian nostalgia but on the theological understanding of the body. ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2860))
- The church must see that its own disciplinary resources—Eucharist, penance, virtue, works of mercy, martyrdom—are not matters of the soul which must somehow “animate” the “real world” of bodies, but are rather body/soul disciplines meant to produce actions, practices, habits that are visible in the world. For the church to be a true social body it must reclaim not only its body but its soul from the state, and institute a discipline which is truly Christlike—a power based in compassion and martyrdom, suffering and reconciliation, and not in a revived Christendom.[12] ([Location 2866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2866))
- misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of torture. For torture is not primarily an attack on individual bodies. Individual bodies suffer great pain and distress; but the purpose of torture is the disintegration of social bodies. “Torture is not merely an attack on, but the creation of, individual bodies.”[16] Torture is an extreme version of the process common to modernity, of the state dismantling intermediate social bonds in the name of giving individuals equality under the law, with the result that none of the ties and bonds by which medieval persons identified themselves any longer hold sway. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2881))
- is not that rights are in any sense equivalent to torture. It is that rights contribute to the atomization of civil society, transferring power from intermediate social bodies to the state as a whole, in the name of protecting the individual. But this protection counts for nothing when a more sinister power atomizes society and leaves the individual naked before the merciless power of the state, ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2886))
- What is required of the church therefore is to reassert itself as a body in its own right. The church’s response to torture is not to campaign for individual rights, because the notion of individual rights colludes with the assumption that the individual is at the mercy of the state. Instead, the church needs nothing less than to remember and demonstrate that it is the true body, a body more significant than either individual or state, a body entered in baptism and shaped by the Eucharist. It is the body of Christ. ([Location 2892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2892))
- Torture and disappearance undermine and attempt to obliterate all social bodies between state and individual. The church, through its program of social solidarity, set about knitting them back together. By constituting a new body, by knitting together a renewed social fabric, the church responded to torture and disappearance.

- The central argument of Torture and Eucharist is that it is the regular practice of the Eucharist that forms and constitutes the body of Christ as a body that is capable of addressing torture. In chapter 6 above I argued for the significance of the imagination in ethics and suggested that the habits and practices of the church formed the moral imagination of Christians. This is how Cavanaugh understands the Eucharist and its importance in Chile. “The Eucharist is much more than a ritual repetition of the past. It is rather a literal re-membering of Christ’s body, a knitting together of the body of Christ by the participation of many in his sacrifice. . . . If torture is the imagination of the state, the Eucharist is the imagination of the church.”[21] The Eucharist is the principal way in which the church ([Location 2932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2932))
- In order to create and maintain a visible body capable of standing apart from the world, the church requires considerable discipline. Discipline is that pattern of practices which strengthens the body so that it can withstand the power of those forces that refuse the sovereignty of Christ. The Eucharist is central to that discipline, because it makes the body visible and because it is the sacrament that anticipates the parousia now.

- the three-year preparation: right doctrine is secondary. Likewise in the Eucharist, reconciliation is not just a fruit of participation in the sacrament, but a requirement. Those who are at odds with one another are not to take part. The instructions of Matthew 5:23–26 are crucial: coming to the altar is coming to God’s judgment seat; and to come unreconciled is to come unprepared.

- the portrayal of torture as a perverted liturgy. In other words, torture and Eucharist emerge as rival practices that compete to define the social nature of the body. The task of the church in the face of torture is not so much to block it, since it does not have the power do so, but rather to interpret it as a liturgy and to renew its own liturgy in the face of it. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2987))
- “torture is a kind of perverted liturgy, a ritual act which organizes bodies in the society into a collective performance, not of true community, but of an atomized aggregate of mutually suspicious individuals.”[29] There is a kind of drama going on, in which the victims are made to speak the words of the regime, to “double the voice of the state.” ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2990))
- By contrast “the Eucharist is the true ‘politics,’ as Augustine saw, because it is the public performance of the true eschatological City of God in the midst of another City which is passing away.”[31] It is important to understand the relation of the church to the world in this sense. “The point is not to politicise the Eucharist, but to ‘Eucharistize’ the world.”[32] ([Location 2998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005OYUZ1G&location=2998))

- In giving their bodies to Christ in the Eucharist, a confession is made, but it is not the voice of the state that is heard. The torturer extracts a confession of the unlimited power of the state.

- A similar practice is common among instrumental performers when they make mistakes in their play, incorporating what they call passing notes into their performance rather than calling a halt. A story is told of the violinist Itzhak Perlman. Once, while playing a violin concerto, he found that one of the strings snapped in the first movement. He continued as if nothing had happened, playing on with just the three strings. Speaking to the audience afterwards, he said, “Our job is to make music with what remains.” (I owe this story to Rabbi Jonathan Sacks.) Likewise in the tradition of Eastern rug-making, mistakes must not be made, but, when they are made, they must not be unpicked: instead a new design emerges that incorporates the mistake into a new pattern.

- Pope John Paul II illustrates this point in his account of the demise of socialism in Eastern Europe, which has, he says, “been overcome by the non-violent commitment of people who, while always refusing to yield to the force of power, succeeded time after time in finding effective ways of bearing witness to the truth. This disarmed the adversary, since violence always needs to justify itself through deceit, and to appear, however falsely, to be defending a right or responding to a threat posed by others.” Centesimus Annus in Origins 21/1 (May 16, 1991): 23.
