### Highlights

- To deliver India from British rule was by no means Gandhi’s only preoccupation. The forging of harmonious relations between India’s often disputatious religious communities was a second. The desire to end the pernicious practice of untouchability in his own Hindu faith was a third. And the impulse to develop economic self-reliance for India and moral self-reliance for Indians was a fourth. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=174))
- For Gandhi, political independence meant nothing at all unless it was accompanied by religious harmony, caste and gender equality, and the development of self-respect in every Indian. Other patriots had used the Hindi word swaraj to signify national independence; Gandhi made Indians aware of its true or original meaning, swa-raj, or self-rule. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=183))
- Gandhi actively engaged with every important aspect of social and public life in India: the impact of colonialism, the caste system, religious conflict, the emancipation of women, the role of the State in social life, the role of technology in economic reconstruction, the role of language in social and national renewal. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=199))
- The playwright Michael Frayn once remarked that ‘ideas adopt you, like a lost dog on a walk’. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=230))

- prose style ‘all his own, composed of short sentences shot-out like shrapnel in a feu de joie at a new-year parade, dynamic in force and devastating in effect’. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=262))
- He called this satyagraha, or truth-force. This involved the deliberate violation of laws deemed to be unjust. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=358))
- the sustenance of religious and linguistic pluralism was central to the nurturing of nationhood. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=367))
- Ten days into the journey, Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia started mobilizing in defence of the Serbs, prompting the Germans to do the same on behalf of the Austrians. On 1 August, Germany and Russia were officially at war. Two days later, Germany invaded Belgium. Now France also stood threatened; on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=395))
- his nephew Maganlal, he said that since London owed its food and supplies to the protection of the navy, merely by living there he was participating in the conflict. Attending to the war wounded was his way of repayment for this protection. Otherwise, he wrote, ‘there was only one right course left, which was to go away to live in some mountain or cave in England itself and subsist on whatever food or shelter Nature might provide…I do not yet possess the spiritual strength necessary for this.’10 ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=445))

- Whereas Calcutta was to a large extent a Bengali city, and Madras a Tamil town, Bombay was a microcosm of the subcontinent, home to migrants from all over India and of all religions and ethnicities. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=484))
- Gokhale, said Gandhi, was a Hindu, but of the right type. A Hindu Sannyasi once came to him and made a proposal to push the Hindu political cause in a way which would suppress the Mahommedan and he pressed his proposal with many specious religious reasons. Mr. Gokhale replied to this person in the following words: ‘If to be a Hindu I must do as you wish me to do, please publish it abroad that I am not a Hindu.’36 ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=628))

- Gandhi was the traditional overbearing Hindu patriarch: insensitive to the wishes and desires of his wife; demanding that his children obey his instructions even when they had reached adulthood. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=715))
- They would take personal vows of truth, non-violence, celibacy, non-stealing, non-possession and ‘control of the palate’. They would also commit themselves to the wearing and promotion of hand-spun cloth and the abolition of untouchability. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=746))
- Community prayers (with hymns and texts drawn from Hindu, Christian, Parsi and Muslim traditions) were followed by breakfast. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=754))
- Varnashramadharma, the rules of caste, strictly forbade members of different castes from living under the same roof or eating at the same table. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=787))
- Gandhi said: ‘The Ashram does not follow the varnashram dharma.’ This, he argued, was because the inmates were in the stage of sannyas (renunciation) where such rules did not apply. Then, in a bow to orthodox opinion, Gandhi added: ‘Apart from this, the Ashram has a firm belief in the varnashram dharma. The discipline of caste seems to have done no harm to the country…There is no reason to believe that eating in company promotes brotherhood ever so slightly.’ ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=791))

- Though technically Hindus, they were not considered part of the varna system, and not allowed to worship in temples, nor allowed to draw water from the same wells as upper-caste Hindus. In some parts of India even the sight of an ‘untouchable’ was said to ‘pollute’ the Brahmins. The economic degradation and social humiliation that ‘untouchables’ in India experienced had no parallel elsewhere in the world.*2 ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=800))
- Gandhi himself believed that the practice of untouchability was immoral and unjust. Friends like Lazarus pushed him to make its abolition an active part of his programme. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=814))
- Gandhi was himself not a Brahmin; born in the Bania, or merchant caste, and without a deep knowledge of Sanskrit, he did not have a formal mandate to prescribe what Hindus should or should not do. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=816))
- Danibehn was prevented from drawing water from the common well until Gandhi said in that case he would not use the well either. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=823))
- A centre of learning and of pilgrimage, Banaras was probably the oldest and certainly the most storied of Indian cities. ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=876))
- He then said that Indians would never be granted self-government; they had to take it for themselves, as the Boers had done in South Africa. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=939))
- First, Gandhi argued in favour of instruction in the mother tongue. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1003))

- Second, Gandhi pointed to the sharp inequalities between different groups in India. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1005))

- Third, he asked that officials of the state identify more closely with those they governed over. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1008))

- Finally, Gandhi asked for a more critical attitude towards religious orthodoxy. The Kashi Vishwanath was the most famous temple in all of Banaras. Why then was it so filthy? If Indians were incapable of maintaining even their places of worship, how then could they justify their claims for self-rule? ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1011))

- And yet, he made direct and telling criticisms of wealthy princes, important officials and the guardians of religious orthodoxy. In India’s holiest city, at a function inaugurated by the viceroy and patronized by his leading collaborators, a lawyer lately returned from many years abroad had served notice of his intention to transform his faith and his country. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1015))
    - **Note:** This echoes Jesus’ entré into Galilee, wherein he took on these same categories.
- ‘swaraj and swadeshi must go together’. Political freedom, or swaraj, was being coupled with economic self-reliance, or swadeshi. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1025))
- they were asked to disregard differences of caste and language while they travelled: ‘If you think of all [passengers] as children of India who have for the nonce assembled under one roof, and cherish a brotherly feeling for all, you will be happy this very moment and bring glory to India.’ ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1031))
- While condemning untouchability outright, Gandhi was not prepared to criticize the caste system itself. He thought that by restricting oneself to a bride of one’s own caste, the predatory instincts of young men would be checked. But, for those who had already achieved a greater degree of ‘self-control’ (such as himself), mixing and mingling with other castes was permissible. The system, he seemed to be saying, would not be brought down; but heretics should not be persecuted either. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1043))
- Both experiments were inspired by the struggle for independence in Ireland. They aimed at nudging—or pushing—the British rulers towards granting self-government to Indians. ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1077))
- In Gandhi’s view, the movement for swaraj was weak because two major constituencies had been kept away. Since the movement had only men, and no women, ‘the nation walks with one leg only’. Besides, the educated classes had not freely mixed with the peasantry. Gandhi argued that ‘we dare not turn away from a single section of the community or disown any. We shall make progress only if we carry all with ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1366))
- Mehta’s hymn emphasized that only those who understood the pain of others could come close to God. ([Location 1622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1622))
- Some 1,000,000 Indians took up arms on behalf of the king-emperor, playing a major role in both the European and the Middle Eastern fronts. ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1704))
- Tilak’s absence allowed Gandhi to set himself up as the leader of a mass movement against a law that in theory threatened every Indian. ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=1895))
- passive resistance is a force which is not necessarily moral in itself; it can be used against truth as well as for it. The danger inherent in all force grows stronger when it is likely to gain success, for then it becomes temptation.

- For Gandhi, swaraj and swadeshi, freedom and self-reliance, went hand in hand. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2089))

- The commission would tour India and find out the reasons—economic, political, theological—which ‘initiate the disruption in the relation between the Mussalmans and the Hindus and should then think over the means of removing these reasons altogether. Means should be adopted which may place the Hindu–Moslem Unity on a stable foundation.’ ([Location 2161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2161))
- As he put it, ‘All those born in India have to live and die together. No community can rise at the cost of another, or preserve its rights if it permits those of others to be sacrificed.’ ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2176))
- In the diaspora such trans-religious solidarity was easier, since Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis from India all faced the same disabilities. In the homeland, however, the different communities were established in their particular ways of life. To build a joint Hindu–Muslim union against colonial rule was more difficult, not least because the British were adept at playing off one community against another. ([Location 2307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2307))
- Gandhi believed that personal relationships were a reliable route to intercommunity cooperation. ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2314))
- Taking a walk at sunrise, he saw a ‘golden sheen appear on the Ganga’, and as the sun came into view over the horizon, ‘there seemed to stand in the water of the river a great pillar of gold’. This beautiful sight was soon spoilt by another, that of people defecating on the banks of the river. One could not walk along the Ganga barefoot, one dare not drink its water, and one could not visit with pleasure the still dirt-and-garbage-filled Kashi Vishwanath Temple either. When he started his morning walk Gandhi was moved to sing the gayatri hymn (an invocation to the sun); by the time he ended, he was reflecting gloomily on ‘the cause of [the] degradation of the Hindus’. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2337))
- Gandhi summarized the Muslim claim as follows: the Turkish Empire should be fully restored in the European parts it once controlled, subject to protection of the rights of non-Muslim subjects; and the sultan should be assured control over the holy places of Islam in Arabia, although the Arabs could be granted self-governing rights. ‘To deprive the Khalif [Caliph] of the suzerainty of Arabia,’ wrote Gandhi, ‘is to reduce the Khilafat to a nullity.’10 ([Location 2382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2382))
- The attitude of the Allies put a great strain on Gandhi’s Empire loyalty. Back in December, at the Congress session in Amritsar, Gandhi had suggested that the party work with the government in making the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms effective. But he was now arguing that, with the refusal of the Allies to grant the Turkish claim, ‘non-co-operation is therefore the only remedy left open for us’. A fresh satyagraha might make the government reconsider. ([Location 2394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2394))
- And Islam was ‘a complete scheme of life’, which had two centres, ‘the personal centre’ of the caliph and ‘the local centre’ of Mecca and Medina. The two centres were connected, which was why it was vital that the holy places of Arabia be under the control of the caliph. ([Location 2406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2406))
- To the rejection of the Khilafat demand was now added the whitewashing of the egregious behaviour of the Punjab government. This was a double betrayal, putting enormous strain on Gandhi’s once fervent faith in British justice. He now decided that the only way to make the rulers see reason was to launch a fresh movement of protest. He outlined in print a programme of ‘non-co-operation’, to unfold in four stages. The first entailed the giving up of titles; the second the resignation from government service of select officials; the third stage—a ‘distant goal’—the resignation of policemen and soldiers; the fourth stage, ‘still more remote’, the non-payment of taxes. He added that ‘non-co-operation as a voluntary movement can only succeed if the feeling is genuine and strong enough to make people suffer to the utmost’. ([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2468))
- It was customary to rank the four varnas as follows: the Brahmins, or priests, at the top; the Kshatriyas, or warriors, next; the Vaishyas, or merchants (Gandhi’s own caste), third; the Sudras, or peasants and labourers, fourth, with a fifth class, that of the ‘untouchables’, literally beyond the pale. ([Location 2860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2860))
- He did not ‘contemplate under a most democratic constitution a universality of manners and customs about eating, drinking and marrying. We shall ever have to seek unity in diversity, and I decline to consider it a sin for a man not to drink or eat with anybody and everybody.’ ([Location 2869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2869))

- Thus whilst I am prepared to defend, as I have always done, the division of Hindus into four castes…I consider untouchability to be a heinous crime against humanity. It is not a sign of self-restraint but an arrogant assumption of superiority. It has served no useful purpose and it has suppressed, as nothing else in Hinduism has, vast numbers of the human race who are not only every bit as good as ourselves, but are rendering in many walks of life an essential service to the country.

- ‘I am not even prepared to say that this betrays the Hindus’ narrow outlook or that it is a wrong they are committing. Maybe it is, but we should consider the line of thinking behind it. If their action is inspired by considerations of discipline, I would not say that everyone should be free to go to any temple.’ ([Location 2999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=2999))

- It was ‘a bigger problem than that of gaining Indian independence’, said Gandhi, continuing prophetically: ‘It is not impossible that India may free herself from English domination before India has become free of the curse of untouchability.’ ([Location 3094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3094))

- a design containing a spinning wheel on a background of saffron (denoting Hindu) and green (denoting Muslim). ([Location 3116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3116))
- Gandhi looked at it, and realized that a colour was also needed for the other religions of India. He suggested white be added to the saffron and the green. For, ‘Hindu–Muslim unity is not an exclusive term; it is an inclusive term, symbolic of the unity of all faiths domiciled in India. If Hindus and Muslims can tolerate each other, they are bound to tolerate all other faiths.’ ([Location 3117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3117))
- the white was placed in the middle, between the saffron and the green, the two major religions symbolically surrounding and protecting the others. ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3122))
- His defence was then summed up in these words: ‘I hope I am as great a believer in free air as the great Poet. I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.’ ([Location 3298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3298))

- Indian nationalism, he insisted, ‘is not exclusive, nor aggressive, nor destructive. It is health-giving, religious and therefore humanitarian. India must learn to live before she can aspire to die for humanity. The mice which helplessly find themselves between the cat’s teeth acquire no merit from their enforced sacrifice.’ ([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3316))

- A hundred years on, the Tagore–Gandhi debate still makes for compelling reading. The Mahatma insisted that a colonized nation had first to discover itself before discovering the world. The poet answered that there was a thin line between nationalism and xenophobia—besides, hatred of the foreigner could easily turn into a hatred of Indians of other castes, classes or communities. He was particularly sceptical of the claim that non-cooperation had or would dissolve Hindu–Muslim differences.

I remember the time when I envied English girls—for they were free—and they had white skins. You have made us see that we are in no way inferior to any people, you have made us men and women again. Our bodies may be in thrall, but our souls are the souls of free Indians. ([Location 3768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3768))

- Tilak was a mass leader in western Maharashtra alone. If he ventured outside his province, it was to address city audiences in English. But Gandhi travelled everywhere. UP, Bihar, Bengal, Assam, the Tamil and Telugu country, Maharashtra, Punjab—Gandhi went to all these places, visiting cities and towns small and even smaller. He spoke not in English but in Hindustani, the lingua franca of much of northern and eastern India, with interpreters at hand ([Location 3846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3846))
- That he was so widely known and revered was truly astonishing, when we consider that in 1920–21 the radio had not yet arrived in India, and television and the Internet had not been invented. ([Location 3861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3861))
- They were extremely trusting of the British. As they saw it, the Raj had brought order and stability to a divided and desperately poor land; it would bring progress and welfare; and, in time, freedom and liberty as well. On the other hand, Gandhi’s movement of militant non-cooperation was a direct challenge to the Raj, and through methods radically opposed to those favoured by the Moderates. ([Location 3872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=3872))
- Ruthnaswamy praised Gandhi for drawing attention to the problem of ‘over-government’, for making the people ‘themselves responsible for their political and social government’, for insisting that social reform must go hand in hand with political reform (in contrast to other nationalists who claimed that ‘once political reform was secured in India, social reform would follow immediately and certainly’).

- Satyagrahis would, therefore, be deviating from their path if they did not try to court junction with the authorities and cultivate public support by means of deputations, meetings, etc. Direct action does not always preclude other consistent methods. Nor is petitioning, etc., in every case a sign of weakness on the part of a satyagrahi. Indeed, he is no satyagrahi who is not humble.’ ([Location 4705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=4705))

- addressing the Muslims, Gandhi pointed out that ‘just as Hindus cannot compel Mussalmans to refrain from killing cows, so can Mussalmans not compel Hindus to stop music or arati at the point of a sword’.

- Gandhi recalled Ambedkar telling him: ‘Let there be no repetition of the old method when the reformer claimed to know more of the requirements of his victims than the victims themselves.’ Ambedkar advised Gandhi to ‘tell your workers to ascertain from the representatives of the [Depressed Classes] what their first need is and how they would like it to be satisfied’. Ambedkar added that specially organized mixed dinners had ‘a flavour of patronage about them. I would not like to attend them by myself. The more dignified procedure would be to invite us to ordinary social functions without any fuss.’ Finally, Ambedkar told Gandhi that ‘even temple-entry, good and necessary as it is, may wait. The crying need is the raising of the economic status and decent behaviour in the daily contact.’ ([Location 9413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=9413))
- Gandhi saw more hope in social change, in the self-directed renewal of individuals and communities. Ambedkar emphasized the creation of jobs for ‘untouchables’; Gandhi the creation of a sense of spiritual equality between Hindus of all castes. As an upper-caste reformer, Gandhi was motivated by a sense of guilt, the desire to make reparation for past sins, whereas as one born in an ‘untouchable’ home, Ambedkar was animated by the drive to achieve a position of social equality and human dignity for his fellows.

    - **Note:** This was the same year that Hitler was implementing the Jewish laws that led to the Barmen Declaration.
- Gandhi had renamed his weekly Harijan because he believed that the campaign to abolish untouchability was as vital as winning political freedom. India, young and old, present and future, had to commit itself to this sacred cause. The name quickly gained currency; among the Hindu middle classes, and the nationalist press, the ‘untouchables’ were now regularly referred to as Harijans.

([Location 9663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=9663))
- Gandhi claimed he had been asked to fast by what he called his ‘Inner Voice’. The night the idea came to him, he had ‘a terrible inner struggle’. He was restless, and ‘could see no way’. The ‘burden of responsibility was crushing’ him. Then, ‘suddenly the Voice came upon me. I listened, made certain that it was the Voice, and the struggle ceased. I was calm. The determination was made accordingly, the date and the hour of the fast were fixed. Joy came over me.’ ([Location 9728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=9728))
- The fast was broken at noon on 29 May, with Gandhi accepting a glass of orange juice from Lady Thackersey. A garland was also offered to Gandhi by a Harijan boy, its sequence coupling young and old, rich and poor, high caste and low caste, male and female. Dr Ansari read from the Koran, Mahadev Desai sang a Christian hymn (‘When I Survey the Wondrous Cross’), and all present sang Narasinha Mehta’s hymn ‘Vaishnava Jana To’.

- Notably, Gandhi prefaced his remarks to the bridal couple by saying: ‘I do not think that in celebrating this marriage anything has been done against the practice of dharma.’ This was a veiled reference to the fact that this was an inter-caste marriage, specifically a union between a boy of a lower caste with a girl of a higher caste, a union frowned upon by most Shastras and Shastris. Gandhi had for some time past come around to accepting inter-caste marriages; now, indeed, to blessing one within his own family. In so doing, he explicitly set his word and reputation against that of the orthodoxy. ([Location 9765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=9765))

- From personal matters, Gandhi then turned to ethical ones. He asked Kasturba to follow the ‘dharma of service’ both towards the prison officials and her fellow prisoners. ‘Behaving towards the officials in the spirit of service means never wishing them ill, showing them due respect and not deceiving them.’ Gandhi further advised Kasturba that ‘women undergoing imprisonment for criminal offences should be treated as if they were your blood-sisters’.

- bit as important as the Salt March of 1930. For, he had long believed that India would be fit for freedom only when it stopped treating a section of its own population as unfree, less than human. Yet, whereas the Salt March received widespread acclaim from his countrymen, the Harijan tour evoked indifference and even hostility from many Indians. For all his preaching, Gandhi’s compatriots warmed to the idea of political independence far more than to the ideal of social equality. This left him hurt, bitter, angry, confused—thus his superficially silly remarks about the earthquake in Bihar.

In violence lies the germ of future failure.’ If the socialists eschewed violence, Gandhi said to Masani, they would find ‘that there is not much difference between you and me.

- Given the complicity of the churches with Nazism, he thought Gandhi could aid German Christianity in rediscovering the message of the Sermon on the Mount. ‘I plan to go to India very soon,’ he told Niebuhr, ‘to see what Gandhi knows about these things and to see what is to be learned there.’ ([Location 10322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=10322))
- Addressing Gandhi as ‘Revered Mahatmaji’, Bonhoeffer told him that ‘Europe and Germany are suffering from a dangerous fever and are losing both self-control and the consciousness of what they are doing’. As a pastor, Bonhoeffer felt that ‘only Christianity can help our western peoples to a new and spiritually sound life’. Then he added: ‘But Christianity must be something very different from what it has become in these days.’ ([Location 10328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=10328))
- Bonhoeffer was convinced that ‘everything seems to work for war in the near future, and the next war will certainly bring the spiritual death of Europe’.

- Travelling in different parts of the countryside, he noticed the widespread poverty, and the large-scale underemployment too. He thought that promoting crafts and small production units would make the rural economy self-sufficient and vigorous. Beginning in November 1934, he published a series of articles on the invigoration of the agrarian economy. Industries such as spinning and weaving, milling and grinding, could be profitably utilized to augment rural incomes, and renew social and cooperative life.

The visitor asked if Gandhi accepted that ‘Jesus was the most divine’ of all the religious teachers in history. ‘No,’ answered Gandhi, ‘for the simple reason that we have no data.

For Jesus there are less data and still less for Buddha, Rama and Krishna; and when we know so little about them, is it not preposterous to say that one of them was more divine than another?’ ([Location 11009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11009))

- Other parties which claimed a national presence were the Hindu Mahasabha and the Liberals. Although both had formidable leaders, neither had a mass base. Some parties were strong in particular provinces. The Justice Party, based on opposition to Brahmin dominance, was powerful in Madras. The charismatic A.K. Fazlul Huq’s Krishak Praja Party commanded great support among the peasantry of Bengal. The Unionist Party, influential in the Punjab, was a cross-religious alliance of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim landlords. In Bombay, B.R. Ambedkar’s Independent Labour Party had strong support among the working class. ([Location 11040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11040))
- Gandhi’s scepticism notwithstanding, the installation of Congress ministries in six large provinces of British India was a major milestone in the constitutional history of the subcontinent. Much more power had devolved on to the shoulder of Indians than at any previous time in the history of the Raj. Indeed, since precolonial regimes were themselves devoid of democratic representation, and were run by unelected kings who nominated their ministers, this was the furthest that Indians had thus far got in the direction of self-rule, swaraj. Surely it was now only a matter of years before the Congress, and India, achieved the next step, of Dominion Status, thus to place themselves on par with Canada, Australia and South Africa. ([Location 11157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11157))
- Gandhi had always seen the Congress as representing all the castes, communities, linguistic groups and provinces of India. The Congress’s fine showing in the 1937 elections seemed to confirm this wider representativeness of his party. Now Jinnah had come along to challenge this deeply cherished and long-held claim. There were two major parties in India, argued Jinnah, not just one. He led one party, representing the Muslims; Gandhi led the other party, representing the Hindus. Any long-term settlement of the communal question would have to be based on this premise. ([Location 11276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11276))
- In moving from unity to separation, Jinnah was also influenced by the poet Muhammad Iqbal, who urged him to seriously consider the creation of distinct Muslim provinces or states. In letters written shortly after the 1937 elections, Iqbal told Jinnah that ‘the new constitution with its idea of a single Indian federation is completely hopeless. A separate federation of Muslim provinces…is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of non-Muslims. Why would not we Muslims of North-West India and Bengal be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are?’ ([Location 11285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11285))
- Back in 1930, Iqbal had proposed a separate Muslim state in his presidential address to the Muslim League. But that was a single state, in the north-west. Now he had added a Muslim state in Bengal as well. ([Location 11290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11290))

- He was distressed that Jews from Europe had sought to enter Palestine ‘under the shadow of the British gun’. A ‘religious act’, he insisted, ‘cannot be performed with the aid of the bayonet or the bomb’. If the Jews wanted to settle in Palestine, they should do so ‘only by the goodwill of the Arabs’. As things stood, however, the Jews had become ‘co-sharers with the British in despoiling a people who have done no wrong to them’.

- Linlithgow and Gandhi also discussed the idea of ‘Pakistan’, now being talked about in the Muslim League circles. Coined in 1933 by a Cambridge student called Choudhry Rahmat Ali, the term expanded on the idea suggested by Muhammad Iqbal in his Muslim League presidential address of 1930, in recommending a sovereign Muslim state in the north-west of British India. ‘P’ stood for Punjab, ‘A’ for the ‘Afghan Province’ of British India (i.e., the NWFP), ‘K’ for Kashmir, and ‘S’ for Sindh, with the last four letters denoting both ‘state’ in Urdu as well as the fifth province to be included in this future nation, Baluchistan. Moreover, ‘Pakistan’ also meant ‘Land of the Pure’ in both Urdu and Persian. ([Location 11900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=11900))

- Nehru had observed that ‘you will find all the elements of fascism in Hitlerism’, such as ‘a savage attack on all liberal elements and especially workers’. Behind the ‘intensely nationalistic’ programme of Nazism, he continued, ‘lay an extraordinary philosophy of violence’.

- The leaders of the Congress were, from the first, struck by the hypocrisy of the British claim that by going to war with Hitler, they were defending democracy and freedom. When the British (and the French) had denied freedom and democracy to their colonial subjects in Asia and Africa, how could they claim to be consistently in favour of these values? If they wanted credibility for their war against Hitler, said the Congress, then the British should at once commit themselves to granting full freedom to the colonies they controlled.

- At first sight ‘remote from the ways of democracy and indeed of Western civilisation’, Gandhi’s technique, argued Smuts, carried echoes of ‘the Great Sufferer on the Cross’, reminding Christians of their own first martyrs and protesters. Gandhi’s ‘distinctive contribution to political method’, said his old adversary, was to make ‘himself a sufferer in order to move the sympathy and gain the support of others for the cause he has at heart. Where ordinary political methods of reasoning and persuasion fail, he falls back on this new technique, based on the ancient practices of India and the East.’ ([Location 12196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=12196))

In Mahadev’s view: ‘the principal authors of the two nations theory were the Empire builders of Britain.’ He quoted various British politicians and officials such as Lord Dufferin, John Morley and Malcolm Hailey, who had emphasized the divisions between Hindus and Muslims and worked to cast them in stone. Thus, remarked Mahadev: ‘We cannot fix the guilt either of the monstrosity or the originality of the suggestion of Jinnah Saheb.

- Years later, Thurman remembered how he had been subject to an intense examination by Gandhi: ‘persistent, pragmatic, questions about American Negroes, about the course of slavery, and how we had survived it’. Gandhi was puzzled that in order to escape or defy oppression, the slaves had not converted to Islam, since, as he put it, ‘the Moslem religion is the only religion in the world in which no lines are drawn from within the religious fellowship. Once you are in, you are all the way in.’ ([Location 12737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=12737))
- Gandhi, recalled Fischer, was addicted to argument. ‘For him, a requirement was debate with those of different opinion. This helped him to check his own train of thought.’ Fischer likened him to a chess player. ‘As a chess player considers in advance the opponent’s next move and his own, so it appears to me that Gandhi made his move with reference to the expected answer. He did not play chess or other games for passing time, for time was too precious for him and life itself offered an interesting pastime!’ ([Location 12799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=12799))

- independence should mean the independence of the whole of India, including the princely states and the areas under French and Portuguese control; second, that it ‘must begin at the bottom’ so that ‘every village will be a republic or panchayat having full powers’; third, that ‘in this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Life will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual always ready to perish for the village, the latter ready to perish for the circle of villages, till at last the whole becomes one life composed of individuals, never aggressive in their arrogance but ever humble, sharing the majesty of the oceanic circle of which they are integral units.’ ([Location 16098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=16098))

- ‘the Gandhi march is an astonishing sight’. It began just before dawn, with Gandhi setting off on the road, accompanied by a party of about a dozen aides, among them a ‘Sikh attendant who fawns as much as Gandhi permits’. Then, as the sun began to climb, peasants from hamlets on the way came along, ‘swelling the crowds as the snows swell India’s rivers in spring’. They joined in the singing of hymns of prayer and of peace. The peasants pressed in on Gandhi, men and women, young and old, and many children too. ‘Here, if I ever saw one,’ wrote the American journalist, ‘is a pilgrimage. Here is the Indian and the world’s—idea of sainthood: a little old man who has renounced personal possessions, walking with bare feet on the cold earth in search of a great human ideal.’ ([Location 16607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078QS9667&location=16607))

- In recent years, the Gandhian term ‘Harijan’ has been replaced by the term ‘Dalit’ to denote the erstwhile ‘untouchables’. As one activist told an anthropologist in the 1980s: ‘Harijan means what we can never be allowed to become by the caste Hindu, and what we may not want to be anyway. It was a superficial way for Gandhi to resolve his guilt.’13 Although ‘Dalit’, meaning ‘the oppressed’, was used in parts of northern India from the late nineteenth century, it only gained wider currency in the 1970s, following its adoption by a group of radical activists in Maharashtra who called themselves the Dalit Panthers. Now it is ubiquitously used across India, by Dalits and non-Dalits alike, whereas ‘Harijan’ has deservedly fallen out of favour.
