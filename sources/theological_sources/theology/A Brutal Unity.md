### Highlights

- The point of this volume is simple enough: to live is to give up and give away parts of ourselves. This is not just a comment about the social character of our lives. Giving up parts of ourselves fuels our very being as persons: it is how we learn, it is how we think, it is how we grow, it is how we make decisions, it is how we love. In giving up, of course, we are also gaining something new, although that is not always obvious, just as it is not always clear what we are losing as we live, at least not until the very end of this or that process. To live is to give up parts of ourselves, and to live fully is to give ourselves away fully. This ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=65))

- But the argument of this volume is that these elements of giving up and of fulfilling at once, each of which will be discussed in various ways, all pertain to the Christian Church; they describe who she is and thus finally they describe what it means, given who she is, to be “one” Church, the united Church that so eludes her members and whose lack so subverts her life and purpose. To be “one Church” is to be joined to the unity of the Son to the Father, who, in the Spirit, gives himself away (Heb 9:14), not in some general flourish of self-denial, but to and for the sake of his enemies, the “godless,” for their life (Rom 4:5; 5:6; 5:10; 1 Cor 15:22; Eph 2:12). Not that the Church in fact does this. She does not, and hence she is not one, and finally therefore she is not who she is meant to be. But though she is faithless, yet “he remains faithful” (1 Tim 2:13). The woefulness of Christian witness in this world is measured by the distance between these two realities; so too is measured the mercy of God.

- In the world, life is formed and extended in this giving away of self; it is a practice whose shape has itself given rise to various forms of social and political life and, as I will argue, to a life most especially embodied in the liberal polities that developed in Western Europe and America in the eighteenth century. But this kind of life, which the Church has both encouraged and failed to engage over and over, is also one that cannot sustain the Church’s own final calling. Her own oneness, as she receives it, marks the redemption of human political ordering. And so her division marks the entrenched failures of human political aspiration, the intransigence of disorder.

- Indeed, the “political” aspect of division is a major element of its theological meaning. Part of the purpose of the present volume is to press and unpack this point, one whose importance lies not only in the deliberated motives of this or that actor but also in the effects (generally predictable) of the actors in divisive dramas. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=121))
- If, then, there is a new interest in ecclesial division, it is one that falls within a particularly moral compass, for which the now wooden ecclesiastical term schism seems hardly illuminating. I would suggest, in fact, that a more proper framework in which to lodge a discussion of Christian division today would be something like “eristology”—from the Greek word associated with the goddess of discord. Eristology, then, is the study of hostility in its disordering forms and forces.9 ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=130))

- Still, the etymological filiations of “eristology” are potentially helpful to my own project here. Students of Greek philosophy as well as of rhetoric know of Plato’s rejection of what he called the “eristic” argumentation of the Sophists.10 There is some debate as to what Plato actually meant by this term, in contrast with his preferred approach of “dialectic,” or whether Socrates himself engaged in eristic. At issue for Plato, we can at least say, was the question of how “debate” is properly ordered and what its goods are with respect to knowledge. Is it virtue? He pictured eristic as the skill simply for winning arguments, quite apart from belief or perhaps even truth. Yet how can virtue be taught through a means of argument that itself inculcates antagonism, artistry, and finally the arrogance of victory? Instead, a proper debate for Plato ought to seek not victory but the uncovering of the deep consistencies in common knowledge that might lead to insight.

- This common presupposition is important: we come to know by our relations with others and how they are ordered in discussion, not as singular receptors and bearers of knowledge. Hence, in this common vision “agreement” is finally the basis of human being, not simply the basis of peace or peaceful coexistence.

- Peace between warring parties, that is, was achieved through forgetting the “political” realities of past conflict, realities of violence (from both sides) that in fact laid the ground for the restored democracy.11 In the process, many other things were forgotten: victory, resentment, the putative values of this truth over another. For the sake of unity, the difficult genetic origins of unity were set aside. Or was this setting aside the genesis itself? These are questions that modern thinkers, both more philosophically as well as pragmatically, have begun to face.12 How does or can hostility breed division and unity both?

- The divided Church—to give her a single persona—forgets her division, just as Athens does. The difference, of course, is that, unlike Loraux’s Athens, in the Church’s case the forgotten division—which multiplies into manifold divisions—is not for the sake of healing but for the sake of ongoing conflict, for the sake of remaining separate and allowing such separation to be unquestioned, to stand for the whole. Forgetting in the Church is a form of conflict, then, not reordering. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=164))
- Church as communion has failed to deliver practical results given the historically rooted reality of ecclesial noncommunion (i.e., division) that is now ensconced in the polities of Christian organization, in terms of not only the disciplinary practices of excommunication but also the self-definition of Christian groups vis-à-vis other Christians, which communion ecclesiology has refused to question in any direct way. If eristology is to be helpful, then, it must at least aim at correcting or reorienting the ecclesiological notion of communion.

- As with all human language applied to God, the use of the term communion theologically has carried with it the dangers of shaping our conceptions of God in a way that comes to mirror our social assumptions or hopes: God ends up looking like a multiethnic society, a congress, a church council, a congregation, and on and on. What we require for our understanding of “communion,” which is a human and social construct, is that its meaning be informed by God’s reality, not the other way around. If God is never called a “communion” in Scripture, God is clearly called “one.” And hence, God’s “oneness” is what needs to inform the Church’s “communion”: “that they may be one even as we are one” (John 17:22 RSV; cf. vv. 21, 13). The “oneness” that is God’s, however, is, in this prayer, identified as something peculiar: “as we are one,” in Jesus’ words. How is God one? Do we know what this means? Here some eristological nuance will be helpful, at least in defining certain problems, much as it has done in terms of philosophical social epistemology.

- when James writes “you believe that God is one: you do well. Even the demons believe and shudder” (2:19), he is deliberately saying that the “mono”-theistic character of God as an object of faith in itself—whatever exactly this constitutes—is somehow “not enough,” is fundamentally and morally inadequate. James, instead, contrasts such an inadequate monotheism with a faith that is properly tied to “works.” This is significant because the demons know that God is sovereign, but their works are still opposed to his. The issue is a certain kind of life, somehow, that reflects God’s absolute sovereignty rightly and is coherent with it. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=214))
- the idea that there was in fact nothing but God “before” God created anything is nonetheless a teaching present in the Bible and emerges as a central feature of the scriptural understanding of God.19 Paul writes that God “calls into existence the things that do not exist” (Rom 4:17), and this aspect of God is tied to God’s most glorious work, the resurrection and the “new creation” associated with it (2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15). Throughout the Bible, creation stands toward God as that which has no standing apart from God and God’s mercy and gracious will in letting it be at all (cf. Isa 40–48; Ps 104:29-30). Without God, creation is literally “nothing”; yet creation itself is not God. And so the chasm between the two is infinite. This comes to the fore in Isaiah especially. At the core of creation’s being—anything created—is the reality that it is distinct from God. Indeed, one way of describing “createdness” is “distinction.” Apart from creation there is only God. But not only is creation a matter of distinction coming into being, the character of this creation, as coming from nothing and as God derivative utterly, arises in a completely asymmetrical distinction, the maintenance of which is life itself: createdness and the creature are given by God’s own self. There is nothing apart from God. “What do you have that you have not received?” Paul asks the Corinthian Christians (1 Cor 4:7). We are distinct from God, yet we have nothing of our own at least in origin, for we rely wholly on God for everything, even for our very selves. God is distinct from us, yet we give to God from our side nothing in this regard. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=253))

- The implications of this kind of asymmetrical distinction in God’s creating are enormous. It means first that God, who is “all in all” (1 Cor 15:28) and the Alpha and the Omega (Rev 22:13; and cf. Isa 48:12), makes something other than himself. This is an incomprehensible although logically necessary affirmation. In human terms, God creates space, room, distinction, particularity, difference, and differences—a world apart from what is, in fact and fundamentally, all that there is. God lets there be something other than himself, and in so doing God allows an alteration to the whole of reality, to the very reality of his own being. The dynamic here is not one of internal conflict, as it might seem in a Boehmian reading, and certainly this is not where the eristological character of “oneness” emerges, as I will argue below. Rather, to speak of this invention of distinction, as it were, is to say that “creation” is a miracle, not simply from the perspective of historical consciousness, the kind of philosophical conundrum that the “One and the many” may have proposed. Far more profoundly, creation is a “miracle” in a metaphysically foundational way—the invention of metaphysical possibility in itself—because it represents God opening himself to something that, by all logic and truth, should not be, yet nonetheless is.

- Creation, then, constitutes the most essential “difference” or “distinction” of any conception, and it lies at the root of all things. In Genesis and elsewhere in the Scriptures—notably Leviticus—this character of distinction that underlies creation is described in terms of “separation,” the separation, for instance, of the “lights” (Gen 1:4), the separation of the creatures into clean and… ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=277))

- Although the “image” and “likeness” that human beings maintain in relation to God has often been attributed to the diversity of the Trinitarian divine reality (Gen 1:26-27), it may also reflect (and perhaps more accurately) the creative distinction and separation of being that male and female reflect from God’s own act of bringing into existence. God’s name of “I am,” only because of this creative work, now implies an “I am not” with respect to something new and other. The world now, from the hand of God, is made up of “this” and “not that,” or of “this” and “that” where neither are identical. Difference is the stuff, the… ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=283))
- Hence, when we say that “God is one,” we are speaking of oneness, although we can understand it for ourselves, the meaning of which for God we cannot possibly know. God’s oneness is not our oneness. For we are creatures: our distinction, our being particular and specific, one person and not another—I am me and not you, and vice versa—this distinction is our life, but, because we are creatures, it is also our utter limit. For us, to say “this but not that” is to talk of boundaries that end somewhere. If we count things, it is because things are limited. (Hence, the etymology of the term identity, which derives from the Latin idem, which, while meaning “the same,” was spoken while counting out one thing after another in a similar series.) If we do anything—if we make something, build something, write something, grow something,… ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=292))

- “Oneness” in this case is at best an analogical term, although one that is perhaps more synecdochic than only metaphysically disproportionate in its joint application to God and to creatures. Indeed, it is the synecdochic quality of the term here that undergirds, at least logically, the specific Christian claim—and asserted revelation—about God’s oneness. That is, because such oneness can and must include God’s giving himself over to something that is not God and may even be arrayed against God, something different and distinct, and in so doing gives life—because of all this, God’s oneness is such that it begins in creation and is fulfilled in the cross and resurrection. There is one God; but this God is a God who gives himself, like a Father gives a Son, as a Father giving a Son . . . so that what he has made might live.

- The eristological character of this oneness lies in its completeness and comprehensiveness in the face of created opposition: life is created where it has been distinctly rejected, in the rejection of the Creator himself. Oneness is thus divinely asserted as the assumption by God of the creature’s most profound hostility, a hostility aimed at its very being as bound to God. However we may wish to articulate the Trinity in a theologically elaborated fashion, we can at least say that the Trinitarian description (and worship) of the one God, as Christians came to affirm it, grows out of the profound, unsettling, but deeply determining mystery of God’s creative and redeeming love—the Trinitarian naming of God opens God up, somehow, in our minds, to the “oneness that is not our oneness” but is instead our life given in the face of our own hostile rejection of life and its Giver.

- This is God’s oneness, and in it the whole straining and eristic nature of divine love is given its form, both in creating but more fully in redeeming a creation that has taken a stand opposed to God. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=342))

- Hence our own oneness is, within the temporal order of our lives, something akin to a struggle, to the pressing struggle that takes us from difference and distinction to another, often in conflicted antagonism of mutual hopes, and that, in doing so, pulls us from ourselves.

- Jesus prays that we might be “perfectly one” as he and the Father are one (John 17:23). Such perfection and fullness is Jesus’ prayer for the Church: and that thrusts the Church upon a very different path, not only from human oneness, with all of its compromises and procedural maneuvering (although it does not necessary eliminate this in time); but also from the kind of oneness that would ever imagine it could be different from the Oneness of God’s self-giving, in utter fullness, “to the end” (John 13:1-2), God for the ungodly. The “communion” of the Church is given in the particular “oneness” of God, in other words, in sovereignty that becomes sacrifice, in wills that are given over to the one goal of life—creation in miraculously expended love. Oneness is not other than this. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=346))
- The oneness of God is furthermore given into the Church herself, ordering the Church’s life and fueling her energies, not only as the representation of such sacrifice’s purpose, but as the image of its actual contextualized form: the Church’s mission necessarily is microcosmic in relation to the “coming into the world” of God in Christ. The Church’s oneness is an image of just this. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=366))

- Eristology, then, is given as the discipline of the Church’s worldly existence, tracing her vocation and passage within the divisions of her members and neighbors and within their own attempts at forging reordered and peaceable existences (however oftentimes violently). In this passage, which takes up in its wake the political efforts of those people whom the Church has herself betrayed, the sovereign work of God’s oneness is displayed, and the unity of the Church is granted. That is why this volume must deal with the politics of Christian division and unity, and why this must include, rather than oppose and reject, the politics of Christianity’s victims.

- the politics of the Christian Church’s division and unity must finally include, and not reject, the politics of the modern and now predominantly liberal state, as well, whose embattled condition is given in its own eristic life with the Church and the Church’s purported enemies. Indeed, as I shall argue, the Christian Church is intimately linked to the liberal state precisely because of the historical character of her eristological nature. Divine oneness is given in this and because of this. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IGDXGQS&location=374))
- Eristology as a theological discipline has to do, after all, with the character of contention as a social phenomenon and its resolution on the basis of such contention, as given in the historically engaging reality of divine redemption. The political aspect of ecclesiology, both in its internal forms and in its more broadly social interactions, cannot be subsidiary to a proper—that is to say, substantively definitive—understanding of the Church. The Church finds her place in the midst of the political search for peace, viewed physically and in terms of common decision making and its fruit.

- an eristological ecclesiology would take up the Church’s political history in a way that seeks to identify and specify the actual practices of decision making within various defining orders of Christian communal experience and on this basis to expose the character of oneness, in its historical forms, as it engages in enacted hostilities shaping these practices and decisions.

- That is, it assumes a fundamental scriptural literalism, in the sense that the Scripture’s textual language is viewed as having divinely determined referents and, hence, referents that are—and only because of this determination—“real.” To this extent, Scripture and its referents, however defined in a secondary way, are in fact the primary language and meaning of the Church, privileged and prior to other reasonable languages. This, as I said, is a common understanding of Scripture as an “ultimate authority,” albeit expressed in a particular way.
