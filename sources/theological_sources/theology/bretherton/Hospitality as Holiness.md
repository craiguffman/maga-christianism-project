- This book seeks to address the problem of how Christians should relate to their neighbours when ethical disputes arise within the context just described. Addressing this problem involves first, mapping the contemporary context in which Christians and non-Christians encounter each other; second, determining the significance of the differences between Christian and non-Christian moral judgements; and finally, establishing a framework for how Christians and non-Christians should relate to each other.

- The very newness of this situation – and its instability – raised important questions for Christians: how should they negotiate with others in an ethically plural and vehemently contested social, economic and political context; can Christians and non-Christians settle their ethical differences; and does the historical context affect the possibility of resolution or not?

- The role of religious traditions in national and international affairs was largely ignored. However, the myopia surrounding the religious dimension of domestic and international politics is increasingly recognized as a mistake, especially since the Al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, DC in September 2001. From debates about abortion and euthanasia, to campaigns for debt relief for poor countries, to the political impact of developments within Islam, some account is needed of the continuing role of religious traditions.

- secularist assumptions still dominate political and social debates. The suggestion is that common ground must be found between everyone in a plural society and for this to happen ‘private’ convictions must be left behind. Some form of agnostic ‘public reason’, through which shared deliberation can be processed and consensus reached, is endorsed.

- strategies for resolving ethical disputes that focus on either common ground or an agnostic ‘public’ language of arbitration face a key problem: they often fail to interact with the most deeply held beliefs and important social practices that inspire and shape people. It is these beliefs and practices that constitute particular traditions and unless we take seriously the claims of a particular tradition in terms of its own frames of reference, real understanding and agreement are not possible.

- We need to pay sufficient attention to the particular presuppositions of a tradition, neither judging a tradition in terms alien to it nor demanding it become something it is not. Failure to do this means we try to enter a conversation shaped decisively by one side and so, in effect, ignore what the other is actually saying and doing. The result is misunderstanding and ill-judged actions. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=172))

- For MacIntyre contemporary Western society is characterized not just by a plurality of traditions (a situation common to all historical epochs), but an extreme form of plurality wherein coherent traditions have broken down into fragments that co-exist in a confused mélange.

- MacIntyre’s first order account of what constitutes a tradition and his second order meta-theory of how different traditions relate forms the basis of his constructive response to the contemporary context. He argues that particular traditions should form communities in which the practices and rationality of a tradition are embodied and the dominant, incoherent patterns of the contemporary context resisted. By doing so, communities of resistance engage in a form of local politics that is just and rational. This type of local politics allows for the kind of conversation that MacIntyre views as crucial to resolving ethical disputes between incommensurable traditions. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=193))
- MacIntyre offers an account of the contemporary context as distinct from ages past in its inability to resolve ethical disputes. In addition he gives an account of Christian ethical thought and action as constitutive of a tradition that has no immediately available or obvious common measure by which it can resolve ethical disputes with other, non-Christian, traditions. But the question is, is MacIntyre’s diagnosis correct? ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=244))

- according to MacIntyre, the development of liberalism involves, simultaneously, the development of individualism and bureaucratic rationality. These elements – liberalism, individualism and bureaucratic rationality –fragment traditions and the structures of community central to creating a just and rational society. Consequently, the fragmentation of traditions makes resolving disputes between those holding different viewpoints extremely difficult, so that public debate on moral problems is now interminable, highly conflictual (sometimes deadly), and stifles rational deliberation between contending parties.

- MacIntyre criticizes contemporary modes of reasoning and notions of justice because they lack the necessary conditions to be rational and just. These modes of reasoning lack the necessary conditions because they are based on conceptions of jus as a property (or dominium) of the individual, whereby rationality becomes the justification of the preference (or will) of such an individual, or of a particular interest group.2 Given this situation, social co-operation breaks down, society is highly conflictual, and there is an inability to resolve fundamental disputes. In effect, justice becomes what the strong make ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=266))

- The hypothesis which I wish to advance is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described. What we possess … are fragments of a conceptual scheme, parts which now lack those contexts from which their significance derived. We possess, indeed, simulacra of morality, we continue to use many of the key expressions. But we have very largely, if not entirely lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, of morality. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=281))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- For MacIntyre, modern moral utterance and practice can only be understood as a series of fragmented survivals from an older past. So for example, the deontological character of moral judgements is the ghost of conceptions of divine law, which are alien to the metaphysics of modernity. The insoluble problems which these ghosts generate for modern moral theorists will remain insoluble until their history and context is properly understood.

- we have no criteria by which to judge the gap between what we are and what we ought to be. According to MacIntyre’s account of history, what was eliminated by the eighteenth century was any concept of ‘man-as-he-could-be-if-he-realised-his-telos ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=316))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- the upshot of jettisoning any notion of ‘man-as-he-could-be-if-he-realised-his-telos’ was that: ‘No moral argument could move from factual premises to moral and evaluative conclusions. This is unsurprising since the intellectual material for such a move had been removed.’ ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=327))

- The abandonment of teleology lies at the heart of contemporary moral philosophy, which asks not ‘What sort of person am I to become?’ but ‘What rules ought we to follow and why ought we to obey them?’ ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=330))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- the lack of any coherent rational justification leads to a set of rules and principles that appear arbitrary. This is compounded by the lack of any historical context in debates about morality, for history is judged irrelevant to what are conceived of as abstract universal principles. Morality is thereby reduced to a set of rules and principles lacking context and it is in this form that it falls prey to the critics, notably Nietzsche, who argues that appeals to moral objectivity are in fact expressions of subjective will. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=332))
- For Nietzsche, morality can be only what the individual will creates. Far from being able to make judgements about what we are and what we ought to be, we can only properly say that morality is whatever passes for morality; that is, justice is what the strong make it. Thus, the contemporary question – ‘what rules ought we to follow and why ought we to obey them?’ – allows no criteria for agreeing a resolution. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=338))
- The central problem of contemporary debate is its simultaneous and inconsistent treatment of moral argument as both an exercise of rational powers and mere expressive assertion. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=341))

- As far as MacIntyre is concerned, when any society loses its modes of tradition-guided rationality, and in particular a shared belief in some conception of an ultimate human good, then three important consequences ensue. First, participants in that society are deprived of any shared standard of judgement in debates over particular moral and evaluative issues. This is the case in contemporary society, wherein more and more substantive moral issues are contested. Second, this development, reinforced by doubts as to the trustworthiness of those with whom one enters into moral disagreement, strengthens the tendency to construe appeals to principle as nothing more than masked expressions of desire, preference and will. Thus, distinguishing between genuine rational debate and its parody becomes increasingly difficult. Third, in MacIntyre’s words ‘a new need would arise for norms whose central purpose would be protective: to defend each person from becoming merely an instrument for the achievement of someone else’s desires, preferences and will’. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=346))

- Justice could no longer be understood exclusively or even primarily as a matter of sustaining and repairing the breaches in an order in which allocations were in respect of contributions to a good, in shared allegiance to which social cooperation found its warrant.12 Rather, justice would be transmuted into the defending of each against all.

- MacIntyre does not see liberal democracy as in the vanguard of human freedom. Rather, he sees the politics and practices of liberal democracy as intrinsically unjust. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=367))

- He describes the modern state as ‘a large, complex and often ramshackle set of interlocking institutions, combining none too coherently the ethos of a public utility company with the inflated claims to embody ideals of liberty and justice’.14 He condemns its democratic aspects as a charade.15 For MacIntyre, the societies of advanced Western modernity are run by ‘oligarchies disguised as liberal democracies’.

- MacIntyre does see the modern predicament as particularly acute, especially since it is characterized by ‘a politics from whose agendas enquiry concerning the nature of that politics has been excluded, a politics thereby protected from perceptions of its own exclusions and limitations’.20 It is this situation which is distinctive.

    - **Note:** This blindness to exclusions evokes white nationalism’s blindness to Whiteness.
- MacIntyre perceives the acuteness of the contemporary situation as rooted in problems intrinsic to the primary discourse of contemporary moral philosophy: liberal individualism. As briefly noted above, the inability to provide justification for moral principles develops out of a conception of rationality as universal and without social context.

- In MacIntyre’s understanding, rational enquiry into morals is inherently tradition-bound and must take account of its social context.

- According to MacIntyre, liberalism, in acting like a tradition, not only contradicts its own basic presuppositions, but is also, in practice, oppressive: it is engaged in imposing its conception of the good politically, legally, socially, and culturally wherever it has power to do so. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=432))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- For MacIntyre, the fruit of liberalism is an increasingly fragmented society which increasingly inhibits the ability to make appropriate choices as there is less and less society to be a part of. Hence, liberalism is incapable of securing justice and ensuring that morality is not what the strong decide. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=438))

- These systems embody ‘bureaucratic rationality’. As defined by Weber, this rationality involves being engaged in a competitive struggle for scarce resources, both human and non-human, and in seeking to direct these resources as effectively as possible to specified ends.29 Thus, according to MacIntyre, not only is public life and moral discourse in disarray, it is also oppressive because the quest for justice is replaced by the demand for managerial effectiveness.

- In summary, the development of liberalism, from the Enlightenment period on, involves, simultaneously, the development of individualism and bureaucratic rationality. These core elements of modernity – liberalism, individualism and bureaucratic rationality – have together led to the fragmentation of traditions and the structures of community central to creating a just and rational society. The injustice of the present context and the fragmentation of traditions make resolving disputes between different viewpoints extremely difficult, so that public moral discourse is now highly conflictual and often violent; ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=452))

- Any coherent and complex form of socially established co-operative human activity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in the course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are appropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity, with the result that human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends and goods involved, are systematically extended.

- In order to flourish, we need both those virtues that enable us to function as independent and accountable practical reasoners and those virtues that enable us to acknowledge the nature and extent of our dependence on others. Both the acquisition and the exercise of those virtues are possible only insofar as we participate in social relationships of giving and receiving, social relationships governed by and partially defined by the norms of the natural law.

- A tradition is constituted by a set of practices and is the medium by which such practices are shaped and transmitted across generations. Mulhall and Swift note that, for MacIntyre, ‘Traditions may be primarily religious or moral (for example Catholicism or humanism), economic (for example a particular craft or profession, trade union or manufacturer), aesthetic (for example modes of literature or painting), or geographical (for example crystallizing around the history and culture of a particular house, village or region).’ ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=514))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- MacIntyre’s understanding of tradition lies at the heart of his moral and epistemological theory. For MacIntyre, the narrative of an individual’s life is to be understood against the background of the wider social context within which that individual finds herself. This wider social context consists of sets of practices that serve to define the virtues, and those practices, in turn, sustain and are sustained within a tradition that provides the resources with which the individual may pursue her quest for the good. Thus, the individual does not decide to join a tradition, but is inducted into a particular tradition and, through that tradition, into a way of reading the world.

- Herein lies the epistemological dimension of traditions. It is traditions that are the repositories of standards of rationality, which in turn enable appropriate moral deliberation and action in accord with the natural law.

- Central to MacIntyre’s view is the contention that while standards of truth and rationality are inseparable from a particular, historical tradition, truth is the goal of all inquiry. We advance towards this truth by degrees, error being attributed to the mind’s inadequate grasp of its object. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=541))

- Aquinas, on the other hand, drew from Augustine and the Bible the ultimate end of practical rationality and the conditions for the possibility of achieving such an end. Thus for Aquinas, revelation complemented Aristotle by supplying a more adequate characterization of the nature of the end of practical rationality, and providing a formulation for achieving this ultimate end.

- achieve the good, but also human knowledge of the good.48 For MacIntyre, once the notion of sin is introduced a radically new vision of action and agency becomes necessary. To know and do what is good requires radically new qualities of character, infused by the free grace of a good God, whereby we may pursue our ultimate end. In Aquinas’s account, these new qualities of character are the freely given gifts of faith, hope, and charity. For MacIntyre, the Augustinian notion of the perverted will does not derail the Thomist appropriation of Aristotle but complements it.49 However, it does relativize Aristotle’s account of the virtues because grace becomes the necessary complement to practical rationality.50 On MacIntyre’s reading of the Thomist synthesis, it is precisely because of Aristotle’s analysis of practical rationality as involving the virtues that something like grace is required: if we need to be a particular kind of person in order to move towards knowledge of the truth about the human good, but we cannot become this kind of person in our strength alone (because our will is perverse), then we need the grace and revelation of God to continue on our quest to the human good (that is, friendship with God).

- Thus the scope of human discourse is limited so that, in MacIntyre’s view, humans must advance to truth incrementally. Only by subjecting the views of one’s tradition to dialectical testing can one attribute reasonableness to the tradition. Success in such encounters grants warrant to the truth-claims and assertions of a tradition. Through dialectical testing, error is attributed to the mind’s inadequate grasp. Discovery of limitations is the source of progress not despair. MacIntyre couples this conception of warranted assertability with a conception of truth as timeless and universal.

- Only a life whose actions have been directed by and whose passions have been disciplined and transformed by the practice of the moral and intellectual virtues and the social relationships involved in and defined by such practice will provide the kind of experience from which and about which reliable practical inferences and sound theoretical arguments about practices can be derived.

- In developing this line of argument MacIntyre recognizes that while the pursuit of truth is relative to a particular tradition the truth that tradition seeks is independent of any particular tradition. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=622))

- With Aquinas, MacIntyre holds that human beings ‘are indeed by our specific nature directed toward certain hierarchically ordered ends, and it is not in our power to have ends other than these.’66 We can decide whether or not to engage in rational decision making and to direct our actions to those ends or not. However, MacIntyre warns that the ‘virtues of independent rational agency’ which enable humans to transcend their animal nature need for their adequate exercise to be accompanied by ‘the virtues of acknowledged dependence’.67 Thus human flourishing requires a certain kind of society, one whose common good takes account of human vulnerability and interdependence. Natural law articulates the necessary conditions for humans to direct their actions towards appropriate ends. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=665))

- For MacIntyre Christianity is necessarily incommensurable with other ethical traditions. Moreover, the contemporary context in which Christians encounter those outside its tradition is unjust, oppressive, and detrimental to rational debate between Christians and non-Christians. According to MacIntyre, Christians will often be incoherent to their neighbours and their moral positions viewed by non-Christians as mere plays for power. However, it is still possible for Christians to engage with their neighbours in ethical disputes in a rational way. The possibility of rational engagement with rival traditions depends on a Thomistic account of ethics. MacIntyre contends that a Thomistic account of ethics can adjudicate and resolve disputes with those who follow its two predominant, contemporary rival traditions: that is, liberals and genealogists.

- Grisez’s first formulations of his natural law ethics were as part of his response to changes in legislation regarding abortion that were justified on grounds of individual freedom.2 Grisez rejected the radical individualism the policy presupposed, perceiving it to be a denial of the human community of trust basic to the bearing and nurture of children.3 He was appalled that human rights, which formed the intellectual foundations of the policy, could become restricted to the strong and the self-sufficient.

- Grisez’s concern for it is indicated by his theory of the goods. We see in his theory essentially the same project as Plato’s: how can we say that the goods of excellence supersede and define the goods of effectiveness, so that justice is not simply what the strong make it?

- Both men criticise modernity for its stress on the individual as a right-holder, and its emphasis on procedures rather than virtues. Both thinkers stress the importance of the community, in which citizens can participate and in which moral discourse is guided by a practical orientation on the good life. Both criticise the distinction between private and public and the modern tendency to relegate morals to the private domain only. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=978))
- what distinguishes the new natural law theorists from MacIntyre is that they explicitly refuse to underpin their approach with any significant criticism of the essentially modern programme in which reason is given priority over nature.9 This difference is drawn out sharply in the different approaches Grisez and MacIntyre have to Aquinas.

- according to Porter, moral claims have a motivational force for Aquinas because they are in the agent’s self-interest: that is, what they ought to do relates to what they are in reality. Porter goes on to say: ‘Anyone who understands that his own true good lies in acting in accordance with these claims [about what he is] will necessarily be motivated to act upon them. Of course someone who does not understand that will not be so motivated.’15 What Porter articulates as Aquinas’s perspective is exactly the position MacIntyre now takes.

- does Grisez’s approach to natural law, and his essentially modern account of moral decision making, provide both a better way to address the question of whether Christians and non-Christians can resolve ethical disputes (and if so how can this be done), and a better account of how Christians might respond to the dysfunctional nature of contemporary moral discourse?

- For Grisez, our capacity for reflective freedom is part of our bearing God’s image and is central to our ability to realize the whole range of basic goods open to us. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1016))
    - **Note:** This echoes Tillich’s definition of Man as ‘finite freedom.’
- These basic goods are divided into two kinds. There are substantive goods: these are prior to and apart from our choices. There are also reflexive goods that can be instantiated only in and through the choices by which one acts towards their attainment. Choice enters into their very definition; they cannot be realized or participated in except by choosing to realize or participate in them.19 This leads to Grisez’s axiology: our natural inclinations point us to these goods, and each of these goods is a dimension of what it means to be human; so that each of these basic goods is a constituent of human flourishing or integral fulfilment. This fulfilment is our telos so that we do not aim merely to fulfil certain roles or skills but to develop a kind of human excellence. It is reason that directs our free responses to the basic goods, enabling us to pursue them in a creative way. But we are limited in our ability to pursue and fulfil these goods.

    - **Tags:** #orange
- But how are we to proceed, given the existence of a plurality of incommensurable and non-fungible goods? For Grisez, the moral course is to remain open to all of the goods and co-operate with others so that the community, if not the individual, can realize the fullest range of goods. It is this that constitutes the common good. This gives rise to Grisez’s first principle of morality, which he formulates as follows: ‘In voluntarily acting for human goods and avoiding what is opposed to them, one ought to choose and otherwise will those and only those possibilities whose willing is compatible with a will toward integral human fulfillment.’ ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1028))

- For Grisez, practical rationality provides a tradition-free and universal means of settling ethical disputes between different traditions. Indeed, Grisez’s understanding of ethics implies that Christians can resolve ethical disputes with non-Christians on the basis of a shared rationality and a general ethics. What is especially significant for resolving ethical disputes is that, for Grisez, there is no substantive body of Christian knowledge.

- For Grisez, there are no substantive differences between the moral knowledge of Christians and non-Christians; thus, according to Grisez, Christians and non-Christians can resolve ethical disputes on the basis of practical reason. Grisez holds that the Christian faith deepens both the epistemic and axiological level of his account of practical rationality. Thus, Scripture underscores and clarifies what reason can discern and our covenant relationship with God sets the basic goods within a broader and deeper context. For example, from the perspective of unaided reason alone, friendship, and its distinctive expression in marriage (sexual community), are great goods. Understood in the light of Scripture, however, their significance as part of integral human fulfilment is intensified for they point to our friendship with God.

- For example, to respond to deadly aggression non-violently instead of reacting in self-defence (which entails the use of violent force) is to go beyond the dictates of reason alone.

- Grisez elucidates further: In taking the actual human condition into account, divine revelation proposes specific norms, which can be derived from the general norms of human morality, yet are unknowable without the light of faith.

Rather than ignoring or violating the general requirements of human morality, one who lives by Christian faith fulfils them.

Furthermore, for Grisez, while there is Christian action (derived from the moral law further specified by revelation) this action cannot, in any substantive way, be said to be unique or distinctive to moral knowledge available apart from revelation. The implications of this view in relation to how Grisez conceives the depth of difference between Christians and non-Christians on moral questions are manifold.

- Grisez’s account of ethics contrasts directly with MacIntyre because for Grisez practical rationality is universal and not situated within a tradition. In other words, Grisez rejects MacIntyre’s view that all knowledge is tradition-situated, and has a very different conception of practical rationality and truth.

- In contrast to MacIntyre, Grisez believes morality is not derived from some prior reality, discerned by theoretical knowledge. Rather, Grisez posits a universal and self-evident practical rationality through which morality is discerned. Unlike theoretical or metaphysical knowledge that is necessarily arrived at through a particular tradition, any reasonable person anywhere can arrive at practical knowledge. Thus knowledge of morality is not necessarily situated within a particular tradition. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1085))

- Central to Grisez’s moral theory is the distinction between first principles of practical reasoning and the first principles of morality. According to Grisez practical reasoning has two stages. The first is concerned with what might be done, the second with what ought to be done.27 Everyone, whether moral or not, uses the principles of the first stage of practical reasoning in considering what they might do. Following Aquinas, Grisez identifies as the first principle of practical reason that ‘the good is to be done and pursued: the bad is to be avoided’.

- a clear distinction between theoretical and practical reason. Theoretical reason is used to pursue knowledge about reality. It seeks to establish the truth of a proposition by testing the conformity of the content of that proposition with some prior reality, actual or possible.35 Operating using both deductive and inductive forms of reasoning, it produces theoretical or speculative knowledge. Examples of such knowledge include history, biology and theology. Such knowledge is distinguished from practical knowledge by being founded on prior realities.

- In acting on the first principle of practical reason we can identify the eight basic goods that enable us to seek integral human fulfilment. As noted above, Grisez divides these basic goods into two groups. The first is substantive goods that provide independent grounds for our choices, but which are not themselves defined or made intelligible by our choices. These substantive goods are life, knowledge and the appreciation of beauty, and excellence in work or play. ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1157))

- Reflexive or ‘existential’ or ‘moral’ goods are both reasons for choosing and are in part defined in terms of choosing. These goods are: self-integration (or harmony between all the parts of a person which can be engaged in freely chosen action), practical reasonableness or authenticity, justice and friendship or interpersonal harmony, and religion or harmony with God or the gods, or some non-theistic but more-than-human-source of meaning and value.44 And in Living a Christian Life Grisez adds marriage to this list of reflexive basic goods. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1161))
- Grisez is committed to an idea of a shared, common, neutral philosophical rationality to which appeal can be made on disputes about morality that is independent of faith commitments for its authority. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1182))
- Grisez is logically committed to the view that the ethical judgements of Christians cannot be distinct epistemologically from judgements that never consider Christian revelation. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1198))
- However, as will be demonstrated below, MacIntyre possesses a fuller, more in-depth account of the problem of translatability and the inherent incommensurability of different moral traditions. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1214))
- In MacIntyre’s view one must become a particular kind of person in order to make particular kinds of decisions that are counted as moral by one’s community. Furthermore, ‘it is only through the acquisition and exercise of the virtues that individuals and communities can flourish in a specifically human mode.’69 By contrast, while Grisez counts virtues as an essential part of the moral life their cognitive function is strictly limited and subordinated to the modes of responsibility and the prior exercise of choice. For Grisez the exercise of choice lies prior to the cultivation of virtue. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1259))
- MacIntyre’s criteria for being moral, or acting well, are defined by the kind of practice in which we are engaged, not by the decision or preference of the individual. This conception of morality gives a central place to the virtues (which are the goods internal to the practice) rather than to general rules or abstract principles. MacIntyre insists that morality should be construed primarily in terms of a life embodying the virtues (as opposed to the virtues embodying a set of moral norms as in Grisez); and our understanding of what the virtues are, and why they are virtues, is crucially dependent on coming to recognize their place in the practices (not the principles or modes of responsibility) which define them. Unlike Grisez, MacIntyre understands there to be a necessary connection between virtue and seeking the good life. Furthermore, in contrast to Grisez, the virtues for MacIntyre are central to the formation of personal identity and the very pattern and shape of life together in society. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1288))
- For MacIntyre, goods such as marriage and health may be universal, but they are not universally accessible. They can only be acquired through being practised within a particular tradition’s conception and embodiment of what marriage or health in fact consists of. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1298))
- While they both agree that ethical disputes between Christians and non-Christians are capable of resolution, MacIntyre considers such resolution to be hard won, whereas Grisez considers it to be relatively unproblematic given that both Christians and non-Christians share a practical rationality.

- Furthermore, and in contrast to MacIntyre’s teleological conception of natural law, Grisez criticizes Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas for positing a final (dominant) end, as though there is a determinate and objective hierarchy of human goods prior to choice.

According to MacIntyre, practical reason has been usurped by ‘technique’.5 Using a parallel argument, O’Donovan states: ‘Set free from obedience to comprehensible ends of action, confronting all reality as disposable material, [reason’s] primary imperative is manipulation.’ ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=1770))

As O’Donovan contends: ‘It is the freedom of consumers, rather than participants.’11 It is the freedom to exist in a private realm in which no one may interfere with one’s family arrangements, religion, sexual practice, eating habits and so on; however, the inverse of this freedom is that judgements about the ‘private life’ of others are prohibited because to make a judgement would be to infringe on another’s freedom.

This clarification of the ontological and epistemological issues in ethics underpins one of the central thrusts of O’Donovan’s work; its attempt to restore the concept of ‘the natural’ and the doctrine of creation within Christian ethics.16 By separating the ontological from the epistemological issues O’Donovan can affirm that nature/creation is good, although fallen, while allowing that discernment of that order is problematic.

This exclusion of true human life by its parody may happen through structures of domination or injustice, or it may occur at a more personal level through temptation to compromise, for example, seeking sexual satisfaction outside of its true place. However, the resurrection declares this exclusion of true human life temporary.

We can already begin to see that the role MacIntyre gives to tradition in transmitting moral knowledge is severely curtailed in the light of O’Donovan’s account of the role of the Spirit. Ultimately, it is the Spirit who enables true judgement and action. Character or virtue may well be enabled by the Spirit, but, on O’Donovan’s account of the role of the Spirit, and in contrast to MacIntyre’s position, character and virtue in isolation cannot be relied upon to enable true judgement and action. It is the Spirit who enables authentic agency, both by the individual and the community through time, by enabling them to participate in the order of creation by true knowledge and action.

- The reason for its potential adequacy as an account of how Christians are to relate to non-Christians are as follows: given the previously argued point that Christ and Spirit are not limited to the Christian tradition, resolving disputes between Christians and non-Christians cannot simply be a question of one tradition being philosophically vindicated over another. There will of necessity be an ad hoc commensurability because Christ and the Spirit are at work in other traditions and therefore Christians should expect to find convergence with other traditions. Furthermore, all traditions are subject to the natural authorities and so Christians should expect to discover parallels between their approach to certain moral problems and the approaches established in other traditions.

One tradition struggles against another, its justice against the justice of another tradition, until one defeats the other by proving itself rationally superior.’62 By contrast, Volf suggests that traditions themselves are never ‘pure’ but, through their history of interaction and encounter, they themselves depend and draw on other traditions.

It is no longer possible to understand history simply as ‘past’, i.e. to apply to it the psychological and experiential notion of anamnesis in the sense of the retrospective faculty of the human soul.

- Tradition possesses a proper, created, authority, but it is only one of a number of such created authorities. Like all created authorities, the authority of tradition is subject to the Fall and contingent upon Divine authority. In Christ, and through the Holy Spirit, created authorities may now be re-directed to their true fulfilment. Furthermore, we may now encounter Divine authority directly. Thus, the work of Christ and the actions of the Spirit both reveal the limits tradition can play, and relativizes its importance in enabling moral action. The eschatological horizon of true action relativizes the significance of tradition-situated ethics: we look forward to a time when no mediation, via tradition, between God and humans is necessary, nor between one generation and the next, for we shall participate fully in the presence of God and will share equally and reciprocally with everyone, including past generations.

- On the basis of the comparison between MacIntyre and O’Donovan we have seen that a theologically specified account of ethics cannot vindicate itself against its rivals on the basis of its philosophical cogency alone.

- MacIntyre proposes that particular traditions should form communities of resistance in which the practices and rationality of that particular tradition can be lived out and the dominant, incoherent patterns of moral discourse in the contemporary context can be resisted. These communities of resistance can then engage in forms of ‘local politics’ that are just and rational. This form of ‘local politics’ allows for the kind of conversation and convergence between traditions that MacIntyre sees as crucial to resolving disputes between different traditions.

This is in accord with the initial emergence of political thought via local traditions of practice and MacIntyre’s substantive theory that all rational thought and justice must be rooted in a particular tradition.

- He makes the case that while the practices of giving and receiving are exercised primarily in relation to members of one’s own community and social networks, justice requires extending this to those who are ‘other’ for two reasons. First, we owe hospitality to the stranger in our midst, and second, we must practise the virtue of misericordia: that is, the regard for the urgent and extreme need of those outside one’s immediate community.14 The practice of hospitality and what is in effect love of neighbour is learnt by due care of the disabled and dependent within one’s own community. It is through encounters with them that we discover errors both in our own practical reason and in the norms of our community.15 Therefore, it is through encountering difference – not the difference of some abstract ‘Other’ but the particular differences of concrete persons – that errors in the shared deliberative reasoning of any given community are discovered. And thus the community is better able to transform its reasoning and practices so as to enable all its members to flourish and all its relations, both within and with those outside the community, to be characterized by just generosity.

- This clash of traditions is only possible at a local level within the contemporary context because liberalism dominates public discourse and suppresses all other rivals, including Christianity. Furthermore, the bureaucratic nation-state, and the dominant economic order, actively militates against the faithful practice of Christianity, and thus Christians qua Christians will find themselves in hostile relations with these wider structures. This necessitates Christians forming an alternative polis within the context of modern, liberal, capitalist nation-state, and local Christian communities constituting communities of resistance. However, as communities of resistance they will not seek their own welfare, but the ‘welfare of the city’ (that is the common good), by (in the long term) enabling public debate to be more rational and the practice of politics and economics to be truly just. While open to national and international politics and economics, such a quest will of necessity operate at the local level where just and rational deliberation between different conceptions of the common good is still possible. As communities of resistance Christian communities will preserve a form of life where degrees of justice and rational debate may be known. This activity is akin to how the monasteries preserved the same during the last ‘dark ages’. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=2745))

- Suffice to say that Hauerwas is a good bridge between MacIntyre’s approach to the problem of relations between Christians and non-Christians and one that takes account of ecclesiology. The direct influence of MacIntyre on Hauerwas was noted in the last chapter. Hauerwas follows MacIntyre’s account of the contemporary context and agrees that ‘modern politics is civil war carried on by other means’.39 More recently, as we have seen, Hauerwas has criticized MacIntyre for maintaining a pagan, Aristotelian conception of the virtues; however, it is clear that MacIntyre shapes several key elements of Hauerwas’s thought. ([Location 2870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=2870))
- in contrast to MacIntyre, Hauerwas is explicitly theological in his focus and has written extensively on the importance of the church in Christian ethics. For Hauerwas, the church takes up the weapons of the Spirit and engages with the life of its neighbours non-violently, participating in the civil war of modern politics as ‘resident aliens’.43 Thus, Hauerwas states: ‘Like [MacIntyre] we believe we cannot and should not avoid conflict. However, as Christians we simply cannot engage in armed conflict because of our understanding of Christian discipleship. That is to say we are Christological pacifists.’44 For Hauerwas, even though the church can learn from the world,45 if it is involved in anything less than antagonistic and conflictual relations with non-Christians it has become an instance of civil religion. Hauerwas seeks to recover the basis, and witness of, a critical, confessing church (of which the Anabaptist tradition is his primary model) within a context where the ‘Constantinian synthesis’ (that is, the co-option of the church by the political order) has broken down.46 While the church is to be hospitable to the strangers it finds itself amongst, the distance and difference between the church and its neighbours means that its relations with non-Christians will always be, in some measure, conflictual.

Conflict can be a necessary and constructive part of both social transformation and the relationship between two groups with incommensurable goals.

- we can say that the church is the place which bears witness to relationship with God through the actions of Christ and the Spirit. It is important to establish this in order to be clear about what makes the church distinctive. Contrary to Hauerwas’s position, it is not the social practices of the church in and of themselves that distinguish Christians from non-Christians (although these will often be different).53 As Nicholas Healy points out, repeated performance of behaviour patterns do not, of themselves, ‘issue in the right formation of church members nor the acquisition of Christian virtues.’54 In other words, identifiably Christian actions may be a necessary component of what makes Christians different from their neighbours, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves.

- In the midst of the world in which Christians live, they are given a new home that God has established. New birth commences the journey to this new home; however, the journey does not lead away from where they live, it leads them to the epicentre of their former home, for the house of God, although distinct from the world, is bursting the bounds of, and being erected in the midst of, their old home.

And lastly, it does not involve simply performing the right rituals and saying the right words, while settling for the status quo, as it did for the Sadducees.

- An exposition of 1 Peter clarifies, and grounds in scripture, the point I am trying to make about the inherently ad hoc nature of the moral and social commensurability between Christians and non-Christians. 1 Peter, in referring to Christians as paroikoi and parepidemoi (1 Pet. 1:1; 2:11), understands them to be aliens and sojourners.78 There is a clear difference between those born again and the rest of society. The new birth ‘into the living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead’ (1 Pet. 1:3), creates a twofold distance: first, it distances one from the old way of life, inherited from one’s ancestors (1 Pet. 1:18); second, it is a birth into a living hope, and thus it distances one from the contingency of the present world in which all human efforts ultimately end in death. This new birth does not mean, however, that Christians are to withdraw from civic life.79 Rather, they are to seek the welfare of the city (1 Pet. 2:11ff.).80 But in seeking the welfare of what, after their new birth, is a place of exile, they do not encounter a uniformly evil world. Instead, these sojourners meet a complex world that at times opposes, at times resists, at times ignores and at times accepts the reality to which they bear witness through their life together.

- The differences between Christians and non-Christians are eschatological: as distinct from differences based on human social realities such as family or ethnicity. This understanding of eschatological specificity, and how God is present to the church, points to how Christians are involved in relations of simultaneous distance and belonging, with their non-Christian neighbours. This is because the church is to be a people specified by its relationship with Jesus Christ, which is at the same time to display a given culture’s own most eschatological truth. Therefore, Christians cannot stand outside their culture, or against it, but must participate in their culture and the enterprises of their neighbours, as those transfigured.

- Discussions about questions of tolerance and freedom of conscience have been a constant theme in the Christian tradition. Two notable examples are Lactantius3 and Aquinas.4 It was, however, with the Enlightenment – and its search for a neutral arbiter between competing truth-claims and a growing emphasis on individual autonomy – that the notion of tolerance acquired increasing prominence. The emphasis on tolerance is seen also as a direct reaction against the allegedly religious wars of the post-Reformation era. ([Location 3395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=3395))
- For a person or group to be tolerant, three conditions must be met. First, there must be some conduct about which one disapproves, even if only minimally or potentially. Second, although such a person or group has power to act coercively against, or interfere to prevent, that of which they disapprove, they do not. Third, not interfering coercively must result from more than acquiescence, resignation, indifference or a balance of power.

- First, while it is part of the tradition, tolerance has not been the primary way in which the question of how Christians should relate to those with whom they disagree has been conceived. The emphasis on tolerance since the early modern period overshadowed the notion and practice of hospitality within Christianity, eclipsing how hospitality shaped the ways in which Christians relate to those with whom they disagree. Second, not only does hospitality have more antecedents in Christian social practice than tolerance, but also, as a practice, it is founded on more explicitly biblical and theological imperatives.

- Kant sees hospitality as a ‘natural right’ possessed of all humans ‘by virtue of their right to communal possession of the earth’s surface’.38 He distinguishes the ‘natural right of hospitality’ from the ‘right of a guest’. The guest makes a claim upon one to ‘become a member of the native household for a certain time’.39 By contrast, a stranger may only claim a ‘right of resort’: that is, the right to enter into relations with other inhabitants of the land or community. The converse of this is that the visitor may only attempt to enter into relations. It is on this basis that Kant gives a critique of the inhospitable and oppressive behaviour of the ‘commercial states’ that conquered, rather than merely entered into relations with, foreign countries and peoples, for example, the British in India.

Referring to the practice of hospitality, he states: ‘This office of humanity has … nearly ceased to be properly observed among men’.121 Furthermore, he says of hospitality to refugees in Geneva: ‘No duty can be more pleasing or acceptable to God’.122 As Calvin’s response to those Protestants fleeing persecution indicates, hospitality formed part of the church’s faithful response to new social, political and economic developments and to particular historical crises. For example, while many Christians singularly failed to respond to the racist and violent persecution of the Jews by the Nazis, the response of those that did act faithfully was characterized by the practice of hospitality.

- The above historical review also helps clarify how hospitality may shape relations between Christians and their neighbours. The neighbour is properly understood, within the Christian tradition, to be a stranger; moreover, the stranger is not simply someone who is different, instead, there is a consistent and special concern for the vulnerable stranger, for example, the poor, the sick, and the refugee. Moreover, as the witness of the village of Le Chambon demonstrates, the focus on the vulnerable stranger will, on occasion, mean the church finds itself actively opposed by those who would be, by Christian criteria of evaluation, inhospitable to the vulnerable stranger. As the exegesis of 1 Peter in the previous chapter made clear, a pattern of hospitality that bears witness to Jesus Christ will meet with a variety of responses, some of which will be very hostile. Conversely, because of its particular understanding of what hospitality requires, the church is not uncritically welcoming of everyone: a proper evaluation must be made of who, in any particular instance, is the stranger to be welcomed.

- Fasting is a way of embodying the pain of taking up our cross and physically entering into the expectation and longing for the full disclosure of God’s rule. Feasting and fasting correspond to the different aspects of the eschatological tension: Christians both celebrate and invite others to participate in the resurrection hope, yet we wait for the fulfilment of that hope.

- For example, the problems surrounding affirmative action policies, wherein to counter intolerance (that of racism) an intrinsically intolerant policy is employed (one which causes reverse discrimination), illustrates how difficult it is actually to establish tolerance in practical ways.

- It seems tolerance acts as a break to any constructive action. Hollenbach notes that ‘any form of genuine human action adds to or tries to change the direction of what is happening.’151 Yet, tolerance, understood as never challenging opinions others hold, reduces us to silence and inactivity, because to add to and seek to change what others think is by definition intolerant. As Hollenbach notes, it is obviously a reductio ad absurdum to imply that a public philosophy built around tolerance aims to get people to stop talking and acting. However, this is the effect it has. The impact of tolerance on social policy has been to diminish the arena of public or social action. It does this because, as Hollenbach points out, modern conceptions of tolerance formulate ‘the ideal of respect by only focusing on its importance for individuals regarded one at a time.’ ([Location 4088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=4088))

- when tolerance is a substantive value it is based on a particular conception of the good: that is, the good of individual autonomy.153 The good of individual autonomy necessarily places the good of the individual before that of other persons and provides little warrant for moving beyond the individual good and seeking the good of others.

- Yet the way in which tolerance frames relations between persons precisely acts as a block to such movement. By contrast, inherent within the Christocentric performance of hospitality is the call to welcome the stranger: that is, within the Christian practice of hospitality there is the imperative to enter into relationship with, and accommodate, those who are different.

- the suffering-dying are a good example of those who are likely to be neglected or oppressed because they lack the means to protect themselves. Other examples include the homeless, the severely disabled and the refugee. Tolerance involves no equivalent imperative to attend to and actively help those without a place or a voice in society; indeed, a tolerant society can be deeply oppressive for many of its members.

- However, in the light of the theological account of hospitality given above, neither Markham’s nor Locke’s advocacy of tolerance as a ‘half-way house’ will suffice. The church has no place accommodating Powell’s ‘realism’. As the story of the encounter between Peter and Cornelius illustrates, and Paul constantly emphasizes, Christ breaks down the barriers between different races and nations. The Church has no stake in preserving the kind of unity Powell advocated, one based on language or race. Instead, the unity the Church seeks to bears witness to is the eschatological unity given by the Spirit at Pentecost.

- Christ’s demand is for hospitality towards the stranger and not, as the principle of toleration allows, mere acceptance or ‘peaceful coexistence’.159 Christian hospitality requires the active welcome and making a place for immigrants (whether these immigrants accept Christianity or not) and this hospitality includes the support of public policies that echo Christ’s imperative to make a place for the stranger.160 ([Location 4129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=4129))

- Christians are not only commanded to welcome the vulnerable stranger, but to see the vulnerable stranger as representing Christ. The ground of welcoming strangers is Christ himself. To warrant hospitality the stranger neither has to be deserving in some way, nor do they have to earn the right to it, nor must they possess some innate capacity that renders them worthy of acceptance among the human community, nor is welcome dependent on a well meaning humanitarian impulse on the part of the giver. To be a recipient of Christian hospitality one does not have to do or be anything; one’s status as a guest is received as a freely given gift from Christ. Conversely, hospitality of the stranger constitutes part of the church’s witness to the Christ-event, especially the hospitality each sinner receives from God in and through Christ. The call to welcome strangers as if they were Christ contrasts with the commitment to tolerance as a substantive good, founded as it is on a commitment to the good of individual autonomy.161 As will be argued in relation to the issue of euthanasia, placing a value on human autonomy in no way guarantees the acceptance of the vulnerable stranger. In many instances it can lead to the neglect and oppression of those who are not autonomous, for example, the unborn and the terminally ([Location 4134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDPXYYT&location=4134))

- It is the very demand for a pragmatic tolerance, instantiated in a policy of an inclusive civil religion, that leads Porphyry to support persecution of those he views as threatening the Roman religio-civil order. By contrast, it is the specific claims of Christianity, and its related practices, that grounds Lactantius’ advocacy of freedom of conscience in matters of religion.

- Rather, hospice care, as an embodied and institutionalized form of hospitality, recapitulates the ascension/Pentecost moments in the Christ-event and retains specifically Christian criteria for evaluating what is good and just in relation to the determination of what constitutes good care for the suffering-dying. However, hospice care, in its recapitulation and retention of specifically Christian criteria of evaluation, allows for commensurability with non-Christians at the level of social practice. What follows is an account of how and why hospice care constitutes a paradigmatic instance of Christian hospitality.

- The conclusion reached was that the line between Christians and non-Christians is fluid and that relations between Christians and non-Christians are not necessarily characterized by rivalry or conflict. Contrary to MacIntyre, I concluded that conflict is neither necessary nor normative in relations between Christians and non-Christians with regard to moral problems. However, contrary to Grisez, neither are they congruent by means of rational deliberation. Rather, the church is a specific community with its own criteria of moral evaluation, yet there is no clear dividing line between its life and the life of its neighbours. The analysis established an unexpected contrast: that while MacIntyre argues for the possibility of philosophical convergence, the model of practice he suggests is characterized by rivalry and conflict, whereas for O’Donovan, for whom theoretical convergence can be neither normative nor systematic, the model of practice his account gives rise to allows for a great deal of co-operation and similarity between Christians and non-Christians at the level of social practice.

- As it develops its response, the church will be engaged with the life of those around it, who will inevitably be involved with and inform its discernment.

- as the exposition of 1 Peter clarified, some of its neighbours will participate in the church’s response to the issue, some will reject it, some will ignore it, and some will actively oppose it. Mediating disputes over moral problems which confront Christians and non-Christians is not a question of accommodating each other’s view, nor of compromise between two positions, nor of rivalry as one tradition seeks to vindicate its answer against the answer given by other traditions. The only criterion by which the church can accept or reject the thought and action of its neighbours is whether such thought and action accords with thought and action directed to God. Empowered by the Spirit, the only response the church can make to moral problems is to bear witness to their resolution in and through Jesus Christ.
