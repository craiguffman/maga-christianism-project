### Highlights

- The question goes something like this: “It’s all very well being told to love our neighbors, but when it comes to politics, of what does neighbor love consist?” ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=38))

- Like a triangle, this question has three sides to it. The first is, what is the appropriate response to the poverty, suffering, and injustice one encounters in trying to love one’s neighbors? ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=39))
- The second side is this: In loving my neighbor, how can I keep faith with my distinctive commitments while also forming a common life with neighbors who have a different vision of life than I do? ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=41))

- how should our own roots, our sense of what counts as home, identity, or belonging—that is, what makes us distinctive and particular—be coordinated with and ordered in relationship to those we find strange or who don’t share our beliefs and practices?

- a central concern. The third, often unacknowledged side to the issue of neighbor love in politics is the question of what kind of power shapes the relationship between oneself and another and how this power is distributed.

- Politics is about forming, norming, and sustaining a common life between those who are the same and those who are different (however conceived), as configurations of power shape the conditions of life together at various scales from the local to the global.

- A common life with and for others (including nonhuman life) is a prerequisite for human flourishing: the good or flourishing life cannot be reduced to individual happiness as we are not atomized monads but mutually vulnerable, interdependent creatures whose flourishing depends on being embedded in just and loving forms of common life.

- Therefore, a central concern of political theology is how power is constructed, circulated, and distributed within patterns of shared life, at whatever scale that life takes. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=52))

- Echoing this assumption, each chapter oscillates between the descriptive and the prescriptive, both of which are shaped and colored by theological considerations. This oscillation reflects the nature of moral and political judgment, which simultaneously entails discernment and decision. Just or right judgment has a retrospective element (as an act of discernment, it pronounces upon an existent state of affairs), and as a decision it has a prospective and prescriptive aspect (it establishes or opens up a way toward a common field of action in which moral and political relations are possible).2 Thus each chapter attends to both retrospective and prescriptive dimensions of judgment, giving an account of the conditions for coming to judgment (so aiding discernment) while at times offering specific, normative prescriptions that reflect my own position on a matter.

- Political theology, as I see it, is an interpretive art for discovering faithful, hopeful, and loving judgments about how to act together in response to shared problems. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=117))

- Without such shared deliberation and the modes of association it entails, we are liable to, on the one hand, error, bias, and false assumptions, and on the other, failing to serve that which is a raison d’être of political theology, namely, a faithful practice of politics.

- It is also a theological claim that the stitched-together character of the book reflects something of what kind of creatures we are, namely, the sort who must find ways of coming to and making shared judgments if common action is to be possible, but whose judgments about how to live together are frail and contingent, subject to dissolution and revision through time.

- Furthermore, contrary to much political theology and political philosophy, this book gives a positive assessment of the demotic energies that often shape politics. Instead of pathologizing them as irrational or seeking to control and order them through law, government, or prescribed forms of rationality (e.g., “public reason”), the book attempts a discernment of spirits to see where the Holy Spirit may be at work within and beyond the church in the life of the people.

- part 3 opens with a chapter on humanity, setting out a theological anthropology for understanding how difference and sameness are constitutive of any form of life together with others, including nonhuman ways of being alive. It also argues that understanding what it means to be human necessitates attending to questions of politics and power if our very conceptions of humanity are to avoid legitimizing forms of oppression. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=204))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- the primary focus of part 3 is setting out a constructive political theology of democratic politics as a means through which to pursue the flourishing of creation. Understanding the relationship between Christianity and democracy is vital for three reasons. The first is historical. Democracy was a primary means through which Western churches responded to processes of modernization such as industrialization, the rise of nation-states and capitalism, and the new forms of social and ecological relationships that emerge through them. Understanding how Christianity situates itself in relation to the contemporary context means, at least in part, understanding its relationship to democracy. The second reason is normative. Christians do not need democracy to practice their faith, but democracy enshrines some central Christian commitments, and so, as a judgment of practical reason, democracy should be an aspirational feature of political order for Christians. But the theo-logic of this judgment and aspiration needs spelling out, as it is neither immediately obvious nor well known. The third is apologetic. Atrophy or outright rejection increasingly threatens democracy as a way of ordering political life, solving shared problems, and pursuing human and ecological flourishing. The book enumerates the ways it is threatened and undermined. The likes of William Temple, Jacques Maritain, and Reinhold Niebuhr stated the theological case for democracy when faced with adherence to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes in the 1930s and 1940s, and there is a similar need to do so today. But the context and threats are somewhat different, and so a different kind of case needs to be made. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=217))

- This is a context in which, on a daily basis, I find myself boxed into choosing between, on the one hand, a politics that reduces human flourishing to securing material prosperity and consuming better and, on the other hand, a set of polarizing social scripts that reduce politics to conforming to a brittle ideological checklist, whether of the left or the right. If the former provides a comforting familiarity, the latter compensates with a sense of drama and moral urgency. In my settled moments, I know that neither option abides with the spiritual, physical, psychological, and interpersonal complexities of living a life with and for my friends, colleagues, neighbors, and family members, let alone those I find strange or threatening. Yet such a life is the reality of what I, and I think most of us, seek to nourish, while at the same time having a care for those around us who suffer, whether at home or abroad.

- Like others, I find myself bewildered in the face of what it means to live a flourishing life with and for others and need help trying to meaningfully and purposefully reach toward inhabiting one. In these pages, I have tried to address this need by articulating a political theology that speaks beyond either bourgeois or ideological pieties, and which is capacious enough to address the profound desire many have for faith, hope, and love amidst the struggles and indignities of everyday life, and the personal and political catastrophes and injustices that afflict those around us.

- ambiguous, and this ambiguity complicates the task of this inquiry. A theological critique of humanitarianism must reckon with how Christianity is both an insider and an outsider, committed to and, at the same time, detached from humanitarianism.3 On the one hand, Christianity is a vital part of the genealogy of modern humanitarianism and is still heavily invested in humanitarian work.4 On the other hand, humanitarianism emerged partly as an alternative to explicitly Christian approaches for framing moral concerns. Part of its conceptual backdrop is the transmutation of theological categories such as sin and charity into more immanent and moralized ones such as vice and altruism.

- this shift represented the death of Christianity by its own hand. Yet it is wrong to see this transmutation as a sign of secularization understood in sociological terms as the decline in the public significance of religion. Rather, it represents the sacralization of Christian commitments in a different discursive register, that of humanitarianism.

- On Fassin’s account, for all its good intentions, humanitarian reason enacts a division between “the West” and “the rest” premised on inequality and a hierarchy of human life. “This tension between inequality and solidarity, between a relation of domination and a relation of assistance, is constitutive of all humanitarian government” (3). For example, Western aid agencies value their own workers more than those the agencies seek to help on the ground (223–42). Fassin does not thereby dismiss humanitarianism as hypocritical. Rather, he sees it as tragic and—despite the inequalities it reinscribes—as a way to discursively legitimize and sustain a more humane politics.

- Lastly, I propose that democratic politics is a more theologically congruent and ethical paradigm than humanitarianism for responding to poverty.

- Wholly quantitative and economistic approaches thereby mask how poverty is first and foremost a moral and political problem. Poverty is not just material lack; it is also a lack of agency. A lack of agency undermines the ability of the poor to act with parity within and take responsibility for the body politic. Efforts to address poverty should therefore address the need the poor have not just for food, shelter, or warmth but also for power.

- After 1945, the ways both the West and the developing world answered these questions, namely, through either state-centric social democratic welfare regimes or market-centric solutions, are seen to be inadequate or to produce greater inequality.

- But this misses the ambiguity and complexity of how humanitarianism, divorced from wider political, ecological, ecclesial, and missiological considerations, through its very forms and processes, reinscribes unjust structures of beneficence that make the “haves” feel generous and keep the poor poor. When humanitarianism becomes too self-referential, what is not at stake is changing Western ways of life so that the poor and nonhuman life may be recognized as constituents of it, even if that demands a fundamental transformation of how we live and our order of priorities. Theologically, concern for the poor should be orientated by concern for our common life with our habitat, with each other as neighbors, and with God and the conversion of the privileged that needs to happen to enable this.

- Charles Mills calls for an end to the segregation of black political thought from “mainstream” political philosophy.5 He argues that these two traditions share an important set of concerns. However, these shared concerns cannot be recognized let alone articulated if racism in the United States, which has been judicially backed, morally and theoretically rationalized, and structurally institutionalized, is treated as an anomaly rather than as basic to the construction of the American body politic. When treated as a deviation from an otherwise healthy system, then the remedy that presents itself is to keep doing more of the very things that have historically been part of the problem: the further application of “color-blind” liberal principles and redistributive policies.6 Mills’s critique also applies to political theology generally and to discussions of the relationship between Christianity and democracy in particular.

- Despite its impact, however, Black Power as a social movement has received less attention in Christian ethics and political theology than the civil rights movement. There are numerous reasons for this; one is that the civil rights movement is seen to validate and exemplify core Christian claims. By contrast, Black Power, as Cone discerned, represents a profound challenge to the morality and legitimacy of Christianity as such, and the role of churches in resisting and deconstructing racism. This challenge has been extensively explored in work that examines the interrelationship between Western European strands of theology and white supremacy and the complicity of Western churches in racialized structures of oppression.

- wrestling with two paradoxes central to radical democratic politics in modernity. The first is that democratic citizenship is an expression of individual liberty, but its performance and defense are in great measure dependent on participation in a group. Without being embedded in some form of association, the individual is naked before the power of either the market or the state and lacks a vital means for his or her own self-cultivation. ([Location 1774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1774))

- The second paradox is that democracy presumes the existence of and depends on people and institutions committed to respecting the dignity and agency of each individual, talking and acting together as a means of resolving conflicts, and believing that people should have a say in decisions that affect them. But democratic politics is forged out of immoral people and hierarchal and often authoritarian institutions and is plagued by the despotism of either the one, the few, or the many. ([Location 1785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1785))
- Understanding how black nationalism and Black Power address these two democratic paradoxes renders absurd accusations that they were forms of “reverse racism.” Such understanding also, as per Mills, helps delineate some points of shared concern with other strands of political philosophy and political theology. Moreover, it points to a parallel but not equivalent theological question: How are a virtuous and holy people to be formed out of a disaggregated and demoralized crowd shaped by oppressive institutions and structures?

- An aligned problem for black nationalists, one arising directly out of white supremacy as a political system, complicated their ability to navigate these two paradoxes. It is what W. E. B. Du Bois famously called “double consciousness” and relates to the paradoxically insider-outsider status of being African American. Black lives matter in the United States insofar as they are commodities or sources of cheap labor and, latterly, consumers and debtors. This way of valuing black life is a historical and ongoing basis of US economic and political development. Black labor and ways of life are constitutive of the United States as a nation-state; however, as Du Bois puts it, “I have been in the world, but not of it.”36 While black bodies are a vital means of life for the system, they… ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1797))

- Even after the emancipation of slaves in the 1860s, the racialization of citizenship continued. For example, immigrants from Asia were excluded from being full citizens through legislation in 1882 aimed at those from China; in 1917, from India; in 1924, from Japan; and in 1934, from the Philippines.52 Processes of racialization also deeply shaped who received social rights from the New Deal era onward. For example, the National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act, which guaranteed the right of employees to organize or join a union, and the Social Security Act, both passed in 1935, did not apply to farm and domestic workers, thus denying these disproportionately minority sectors of the workforce the protections and benefits now legally afforded other, predominantly white workers. In 1934 the Federal Housing Act was implemented through overtly racist categories in the Federal Housing Agency’s city surveys and appraisers’ manuals that directed the overwhelming majority of loan money toward whites and away from communities of color. These social policies, and many more besides, widened the gap between the resources available to those judged white and the resources available to nonwhite, predominantly black communities.53 The cumulative social, economic, and political impact of these policies in disadvantaging nonwhites is immeasurable. Alongside all this, from the 1890s onward, urban and social policies stigmatized blackness by identifying it with criminality.54 This process of stigmatization has continued apace with the contemporary reinscription of systemic disadvantage through the “New Jim Crow.” ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1869))

- It is on the basis of this history and contemporary practices of systemic exclusion, a history that reaches back to 1619, that some argue that the United States is a Herrenvolk democracy.57 What is meant by this term is that white supremacy partly constitutes the basis of the demos. Citizenship is not indexed to a singular ethnos or Volk, as in German legal conceptions of jus sanguinis. There never was a singular Volk or ethnicity in the United States, white Anglo-Saxon Protestant or otherwise. Rather, citizenship was indexed to whiteness politically constructed and theoretically rationalized as a caste; that is, whiteness entails stratification not just by class and race but also on a scale of purity and moral worth. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1887))
- The converse of trying to form a black people/nation in a context where “we, the people” is structured in part by white supremacy is that any attempt to do so will inevitably be seen as an attempt to undermine the existing system: black self-determination and self-affirmation become by definition acts of sedition. Members of the Black Power movement constantly confronted the vindictive reaction that their apostasy from faith in the American Dream generated.

- The 1965 Voting Rights Act was in effect the end of the Herrenvolk democracy as a formal, de jure system. However, as a de facto system, it has continued to undergird three other dimensions of citizenship. ([Location 1915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1915))
- Alongside the juridical and governmental dimensions of citizenship is a third dimension, identity. To be a citizen of a polity is to identify or be identified with an “imagined community.”63 As a political identity that coinheres with an imagined community, “citizenship” is not just a legal term; it has an affective and subjective dimension that is the result of cultural processes. Key questions to be asked about this aspect of citizenship are as follows: What does a citizen look like, and who counts as included in the body politic or as a “normal” member of it? In relation to these questions, issues of belief, race, gender, class, physical ability, and sexuality come to the fore. In a Herrenvolk democracy, a central way in which the community is imagined is as normatively white. Blacks by definition cannot be full citizens except by passing as white. ([Location 1917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=1917))
- However, the performance of citizenship is not reducible to formal mechanisms of representation or involvement with the apparatus of the state. Rather, it entails a much broader assemblage of beliefs, narratives, practices, bodily proprieties, habits, and rituals reiterated and enacted in contexts as diverse as the workplace, social media, the football stadium, and the mall. Together these constitute a social imaginary of what good and bad politics entail and, thus, what the good citizen should do. Again, in America’s Herrenvolk democracy, whiteness constitutes a key regulative performance of good citizenship.

- Finally, citizenship names a political and moral rationality through which a “common sense” is forged and reproduced; that is, it constitutes a way of discerning and deliberating about goods in common and a vision of the good life through which “we, the people” come to decide how we shall live. In relation to this denotation of citizenship, the question is how citizens should talk and deliberate together and on what basis they can make shared judgments about what to do and how to do it. The construction of citizenship involves an ongoing debate about what constitutes the requisite kinds of moral and political rationality that make one capable of talking and acting with others in ways that build up the common life of a polity.

- Within Scripture, powerlessness is the predominant way in which poverty is understood. The most common words for poverty in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (‘ānî and ‘ānāw) imply vulnerability to oppression more than material destitution. The biblical sense of poverty as powerlessness dovetails with Greek conceptions of the demos and Roman notions of the pauperi, the plebs, and the populus. They are not destitute, but they are politically and therefore economically and socially vulnerable. The analogy in the contemporary context is with terms such as “the working class,” “the proletariat,” and, I suggest, “the black nation.” ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=2015))

The conflict depicted between Moses and Pharaoh is over who has the power to fructify creation or render it desolate.93 The flourishing of creation is intertwined with and represented by whether the one who claims to rule sees the Israelites as humans capable of being a people or a mere population to be exploited for the good of those with a monopoly of power.

Jesus challenges this formation of living death from the inside out, liberating the demoniac from physical and psychic enslavement and purifying the land from imperial forms of mass production that exploit and defile it and the people who live there: a herd of pigs is not only an abomination but is also a near-industrial level of agricultural production.

- exorcism horrifies those who benefit from the status quo (as it does white nationalists and their allies in the contemporary context). Exorcism is a public promulgation of God’s apocalyptic judgment against the principalities and powers that feed off the oppression and torment of the powerless and the self-destructive collusion of those with power.98 Thus, those whose way of life depends on visible and hidden forms of oppression cannot but hear this judgment as condemnation and threat. In an analogous way, rather than being receptive to the possibility of a more just and loving form of life in which everyone could flourish, many whites could only hear the claims of both the civil rights movement and Black Power as a fundamental threat to their existing way of life, a way of life that disfigured both whites and blacks.

- Jesus’s act of exorcism points beyond itself to how merely changing the immanent structures of power is never enough: disempowering Rome does not of itself generate the empowerment of Israel.99 The people of God need reconstituting, and the broader body politic needs a new animating spirit. To accomplish this, Jesus embodies and mediates a new source of power—the power of the Spirit—unavailable to those who oppress.100 Jesus’s acts of power serve to reconstitute an atomized people so that they may be capable of acting together in pursuit of life-giving, eschatological ends. But this covenantal community is unassimilable by the existing religious and political structures, and its formation is at the same time an act of exorcism of the wider body politic that generates attempts to banish or suppress it.

- In Cone’s early statement of black liberation theology, racism is identified as a demonic force and Black Power a form of exorcism.101 This emphasis on exorcism forms part of Cone’s wider thesis that “To resist evil is to participate in God’s redemption of the world.”102 On Cone’s account, as well as a means of survival, black nationalist and Black Power efforts to form a nation within a nation are theo-political gestures of exorcism within the wider body politic.

Unlike Cone but in keeping with other womanist theologians, Kirk-Duggan emphasizes the self-loving, solidaristic, and mutually upbuilding dimensions of the ongoing work of liberation and the need for new forms of personal agency undetermined by white supremacy.105 Womanist theology explores this process of formation through the leitmotif of individual and communal healing.106 In the light of Kirk-Duggan’s work and the analysis given above, Black Power can be framed not only as a means of exorcism, addressing the objective conditions of domination, but also as a source of healing that helps form a people, thereby addressing the intersubjective conditions of domination.107 ([Location 2081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=2081))

- The primacy of the Christ event within Christianity and its reorientation of believers to their surrounding context demand that Christians distance themselves from the present order of things. “The present form of this world is passing away” (1 Cor. 7:31), so it cannot be wholly determinative of what is true, good, and beautiful. It also contains the possibility and moments of its own inversion and dissolution; it can become worldly. That is, the world is coterminous with forms of life turned away from God in active pursuit of sinful and idolatrous ends (what Augustine called the “earthly city”).1 But even as a form of the earthly city, the world cannot be wholly rejected, resigned to, or treated with indifference. Christianity is dependent on the discursive, symbolic, and institutional forms of the world. And the world is constituted by genuine, albeit penultimate, goods (e.g., health, family, and education), even if sin cankers the human desire for and pursuit of them. Moreover, God is present and active in and through history and within penultimate, worldly structures, so these cannot be ignored or avowed. In addition, even worldly forms of life contain the possibility of the Spirit’s natality—resurrection joy and the birthing of new ways of being alive. So not only must the world be valued in some way, but the possibility of radical change or newness within the world must be witnessed to and anticipated.

Pentecostalism thereby displays, both positively and negatively, how the duality of the church-world relation is dyadic (both/and), not binary (either/or).

- While a cradle and still-confessing Anglican, I write as one suckled on exorcisms, baptized in the Holy Spirit, and for whom prophetic words, healing, and glossolalia have been, from childhood, a catalytic part of my Christian formation. As well as immersing me in the networks and practices of the Pentecostal and charismatic movement, my parents were actively engaged in addressing issues of inequity and poverty such as slum housing.5 Rather than having a sense of disjuncture, my mother and father narrated their social and civic engagement as born out of and sustained by their Christian commitments. That said, their engagement was never framed in terms of justice or liberation, even though much of what they did directly addressed the need for both. I also write as one who has been actively involved in various forms of democratic politics and who discovered there a kind of quickening often absent in the church. And finally, I am someone who is skeptical (to say the least) about the unalloyed benefits of capitalism, seeing in democratic politics a way to remediate the often-destructive impact of economic globalization.

- while Azusa Street is the most prominent and significant point of origin, it was not the only one. Pentecostalism emerges simultaneously from multiple places, including Wales, Korea, and India.6 As an ecclesial movement, Pentecostalism drew on prior revivalist movements around the world, foremost among these being Wesleyan Holiness movements.7 David Martin, a leading sociologist of Pentecostalism, situates it as a continuation and expansion of the “unsponsored mobilizations of laissez-faire lay religion” circulating throughout the Atlantic world that began with eighteenth-century revivalism.8 Far from being an export of North America, Pentecostalism built on existing translocal networks; as an ecclesial movement, it was a “glocal” phenomenon from the outset.9 Furthermore, a backdrop to its adoption around the world included indigenous attempts to generate vernacular expressions of Christianity as alternatives to those introduced by Western missionaries. Overall, the size and scale of the movement are staggering. Only emerging at the beginning of the twentieth century, Pentecostals (broadly understood) were, as of 2011, estimated to number over 584 million, constituting 8.5 percent of the world’s total population.

- I contend that the ways Pentecostals address political and economic life reveal the inadequacy of analytical frameworks that assume that politics and economics are constituted by rational, self-interested individuals who, in the process of becoming modern, become nonreligious. Pentecostals refuse deterministic and secularizing demarcations of public from private and the rendering of politics as a disenchanted sphere. Contrary to the secularization thesis that assumes processes of modernization such as urbanization and bureaucratization generate the decline in the public significance of religion, Pentecostalism points to how modernization can generate the revitalization of religion and an increase in its public significance.14 In doing so, Pentecostalism resignifies the nature of what is political, envisaging the material as spiritual, the mundane as miraculous, and worship as an act of citizenship. Pentecostalism thereby contests Western rationalist epistemologies. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=2543))

- Through the scriptural narrations of the Spirit’s action, a threefold synergistic work of the Spirit can be discerned. First, the Spirit enables creation to be itself through animating, healing, and delivering it (in the double sense of bringing life to birth and liberation). Second, the Spirit comes alongside what exists, fructifying it so as to generate an unexpected excess.33 This superfluity is not against nature. Nor is it a protological extension of nature, as in a notion of grace perfecting nature.34 The transformational newness is eschatological. Even as the Spirit builds on and intensifies what already exists, there is a surprising departure, a rupture even. The Spirit adds to nature more than is expected or seems possible, generating new and joyful ways of being alive.

- Third, the Spirit draws creation into its eschatological fulfillment through enabling participation in the triune life of God. A paradigmatic form of this threefold pattern is the work of the Spirit in Christ’s resurrection and ascension. In Christ’s resurrection, the Spirit heals and delivers creation from sin and death. In Christ’s ascension and glorification, the Spirit enacts the eschatological transformation and consummation of creation as a new creation. And as a work of Father, Son, and Spirit in and through creation, resurrection and ascension mark the participation of creation in the triune life. With the resurrection and ascension, the Spirit is poured out on all flesh (Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17–18), so that all may now participate in the work of healing and blessing creation, thereby recapitulating the work of Christ in this age before Christ’s return.

Understood pneumatologically, the church-world relation is dyadic, not binary, each needing the other to be truly itself. Conversely, both church and world can be worldly—that is, creation turned against itself and God in death-dealing idolatry and sin. Insofar as the kosmos/world is oriented to and captivated by death, the Spirit acts to convert it. Conversely, insofar as the church is orientated to death, the Spirit moves to convert the church.

- In Pentecostal political theology, how the Spirit generates newness within the particularity of a given culture means that political theology understood as an extension of missiology is tied to debates about contextualization and cross-cultural transmission: what faithful witness to and participation in the work of the Spirit entail in Lagos is different from what that involves in London. At the same time, the two are connected, and one can pollinate the other.45 Moreover, if the Spirit is mediating God’s presence in all creation, then political theology is, at least in part, about discerning whether and how the Holy Spirit is at work forming and sustaining a common life in this place among these people, or whether what is at work is some other kind of animating spirit, principality, or power that generates distorting and oppressive forms of commonality.46 Political theology as a “discernment of spirits” is itself a gift of and a way of participating in the work of the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:10).

- If this time is all there is, then politics has no limits, as it has to bear the full weight of human meaning and possibilities. The problem that then ensues is the totalization of politics, which leads either to an overinvestment in political projects as programs of salvation or to an underinvestment that despairs of any meaningful yet chastened political activity being possible. By contrast, an eschatological horizon to history—meaning there is a time beyond this time—disqualifies any absolute claims of a political or economic system to either shape human life or determine the history and significance of everything and everyone. A theological vision of time as history, as open to healing and redemption, and as fulfilled in the eschaton undergirds the possibility of politics as a finite, contingent, yet meaningful activity. The time we live in is limited, but it also has significance beyond the immediate needs and vicissitudes of the moment. When we understand politics as situated between Christ’s ascension and his return, it is freed to be about enabling a penultimate peaceableness.51 As those intentionally living into this in-between time, Christians do not have to establish regimes to control the time so as to determine the outcome of history. Rather, they can live without control because the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ already inaugurated the fulfillment of history, even as its consummation awaits Christ’s return.

- An emphasis on prosperity is a common way Pentecostals articulate their holistic soteriology. This emphasis takes myriad forms.60 However, prosperity teachings often equate prosperity with God’s shalom, the Hebrew word that denotes wholeness, flourishing, prosperity, peace, well-being, and a state of blessing. As Katherine Attanasi outlines it, prosperity teachings about shalom take it to mean “psychological, social, spiritual, and physical wholeness; peace with the natural world, ancestors, God, and fellow human beings; and inner satisfaction, contentment and peace. The prosperity gospel emphasizes that as part of God’s covenant, Christians enjoy unassailable claims to certain blessings as well as to right relationship with God, other humans, and nature.” ([Location 2756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=2756))

- When unhooked from concerns for a flourishing common life, prosperity teachings align sanctification with the ascetic disciplines demanded by capitalist forms of production, distribution, and consumption. Divine-human relations are understood not in covenantal terms but in contractual, mechanistic ones: so much “faithful” action produces a requisite amount of God’s “blessing.” Conversely, lack of such action is the cause of impoverishment. For example, as historian Kate Bowler argues, in North America, the prosperity gospel’s confidence in the possibility of human transformation, when allied with a belief that Christian virtues are the same as market virtues, affirms the basic economic structures of capitalism. North American prosperity teaching encourages congregants to trust that within the providential equilibrium of the market the faith-filled and hardworking sheep will be separated from the lazy and unrighteous goats.63 This version of the prosperity gospel reduces prosperity to economic success understood in consumerist terms, reinforces an unjust status quo, and generates an overinvestment in capitalism as a this-worldly yet providential project of beneficence. In terms of normative Pentecostal political theology, this form of prosperity teaching represents a failure to exercise a true discernment of spirits.

- A central claim of Pentecostal theology is that the same Spirit who healed through Jesus continues to work today. But healing is not just personal and physical. It is also a theo-political act.66 Healing challenges injustice through enacting God’s shalom and promulgating God’s judgment against the principalities and powers.67 As a theo-political act, healing points to the ongoing reordering of the principalities and powers in the present age and the possibility of their ultimate renovation in the age to come.

- As Yong puts it, “Central to the Pentecostal notion of salvation, especially in the global south, is the idea of deliverance understood in socio-cultural terms.”71 Exorcism and deliverance are a manifestation of the fulfillment of God’s purposes, a mark of faithfulness, and a sign that what is preached is true. If exorcism is the expulsion of demonic activity and the abolition of oppressive forces, then deliverance is their replacement by a new animating spirit and direction, one orientated to flourishing, not to harm.72 Like other forms of healing, they are a way the church participates in the Spirit’s work of binding and loosing. Laying on of hands and anointing with oil are a part of deliverance, as they are a way the Holy Spirit mediates divine presence. The emphasis on exorcism and deliverance acts as a destabilizing, critical current within Pentecostal missiology by identifying existing social, economic, and political arrangements as potentially a source of oppression and manifestation of demonic activity from which everyone needs liberating.73 Mission, therefore, involves witnessing to and participating in the deliverance of politics and culture, which necessarily includes discernment of spirits. Spiritual warfare, as a form of discernment, witness, and participation, is thus a form of mission. It is exemplified in such actions as the symbolic contestation of territory through prayer walks, fasting, and worship services that fight the occult forces that are believed to be parasitic on and further distort forms of political and economic life turned away from God.

- Countermovements seek to reembed labor, land, and money within a wider social and political matrix and thereby inhibit the destructive effects of commodification on political and social life. Part of the ambiguous relationship between Pentecostalism and capitalism lies in how Pentecostalism is both a form of acculturation to capitalism and a resignification of capitalism from within, thereby contextualizing and particularizing the supposedly universal “logic” of capital.115 The Pentecostalization of capitalism (and thus its resignification) represents one instance of the inability of capitalism to subsume everyone and everything to a supposedly universal historical process of European origin.

- Pentecostalism is a kind of squatter’s encampment within the structures and discursive registers of capitalism: capitalism determines its conditions but doesn’t limit its possibilities. Like the barrios around cities such as Lagos and São Paulo, or the populist movements that reclaim land and factories in South America, Pentecostalism is occupying territory that does not belong to it while at the same time fully participating in the very structures that render it vulnerable. Yet it seeks to repurpose and resignify those very same structures. Its occupation is inherently unstable, temporary, adaptive, and precarious, and the faithfulness of its witness is systemically vulnerable to dissolution—whether by political and economic processes or by the internal irruptions of chaos and corruption. Nevertheless, as an occupation of capitalist space and time, it creates openings within that space and time to new possibilities.

- On any theological account of time, Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are central. Kairos is one term used to name the kind of time the Christ event represents. Kairotic time is “systolic” in form: that is, like a moment of inhalation, kairotic time is contracted, enfolded, and tensely gathered into the Christ event awaiting its exhalation in renewed life-giving possibility.118 Through Christ’s life, death, and resurrection and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, each moment is open to this life-giving possibility and capable of anticipating the eschatological consummation of all creation. In becoming enfolded in the Christ event, all time is liberated from its entropic movement toward nothingness and can be breathed out in infinite, fructifying variations.

- By contrast, chronological time is linear, regular, monotonous, and measurable.119 It is also time devastated by the Fall. For it is time that leads inexorably to death—whether it is the duration and deaths of plankton, persons, or planets. By contrast, the kairotic time of Christ, through the work of the Spirit, opens chronological time to and suffuses it with eternal life.120 And unlike chronological time, which can only be experienced by those existing at this moment, the kairotic time of Christ is a gift open to enjoyment by anyone at any time: hence talk of the communion of saints as a transtemporal and coinhering reality. We can thus experience two times or two histories simultaneously in the same place: kairotic time and its aftershocks, and chronological time and its duress.

- Pentecostal constructions of place generate a subjectivity that is simultaneously local and attuned to and participating in globalized flows of people and products (e.g., music, social media, conference speakers, books, etc.).121 Arguably, this Pentecostal subjectivity resonates with a theological view of place, which is hallowed not by means of a sacred geography—for example, by dint of its distance from Jerusalem or its relation to a division between spaces such as that between the Dar al-Islam and the Dar al-harb. Instead, it is hallowed by means of its participation in a particular time: the time of the Christ event. Through the Spirit, all places can participate in the Christ event, and our citizenship is in heaven—a spatiotemporal realm to which all times and spaces are present.

- Capitalism, theologically understood, is, among other things, the idolatry of chronological time: it renders the time of death into the means of life. Capitalism represents in part the mystification of chronological time’s death-dealing nature through the commodification of time itself. It is premised not only on a progressive view of time that attempts to manage and order time minutely through scientific, bureaucratic, and industrial forms of production but also makes buying and selling time a requirement to live.

- Marx pointed to the role of primitive accumulation in the form of the enclosure of common lands and the enslavement of colonized peoples in the emergence of industrial capitalism. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri draw on this insight to argue that capitalism can only sustain itself through repeated acts of enclosure (contemporary examples include the gene pool or language itself).124 However, what neither Marx nor Hardt and Negri address is how the enclosure of time through usury precedes the enclosure of common-pool resources and the commodification of people.125 Charging interest on a loan came to be seen as an attempt to buy and sell time, which, as a gift of God, was to be shared by all (this was a key part of, for example, the Scholastic prohibition against usury).126 Yet the buying and selling of time through charging interest is now axiomatic of contemporary finance capitalism, and other than in a diminishing slice of western Europe, the ability of most people to sustain a life through acquiring housing, education, and health care increasingly requires buying and selling time in the form of usury.

A dyadic framework contrasts with those that see the church-world relation in terms of either a binary, where the church is always opposed to the world, or a dialectic, where the church supersedes the world. In Pentecostal political theology, it is not given to the church to define its relationship to the world. Rather, the primary agent in any such determination is the Spirit. The role of the church is to witness to and participate in the work of the Spirit, which can mean acting at times in continuity with the world and at other times in radical discontinuity with it.

- The demonic can be understood variously. For some it is a malignant agentic force that can be personified. For others it is a mythic and metaphorical way of framing either structural evils or psychological struggles. More recent theological accounts build on the work of Karl Barth and Walter Wink to identify the demonic as an empty vacuum generated by human sinfulness—what Barth called “hypostases of nothingness.” As a vacuum, the demonic possesses a negative energy of its own that supersedes or possesses human agency, sucking life and light out of what exists and distorting human relations. Spiritual warfare is replacing that negative, life-destroying energy—which nevertheless attracts humans like moths to a flame—with virtuous forms of action and practices through which the Spirit mediates creative, life-giving power that fills up and therefore closes down the vacuous, chaos-generating forms of nonbeing that have taken root. As per the previous chapter, within this nonontological but realist theology of demons, something like racism is a hypostatized form of nothingness that has taken on a life of its own and needs exorcising.

Reflecting its dual nature as Catholic and Reformed, Anglicanism draws on numerous traditions and approaches to social and political reflection. But for all its ecumenical and philosophical bricolage, APT tends to favor practical over theoretical forms of rationality and is orientated to questions of political order in a distinctive way: it is a church for a particular place and history rather than for a gathered people.

- Some figures, notably Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), combine the role of theologian, political thinker, and poet. Indeed, Coleridge’s work illustrates a central feature of APT. Contemplative Pragmatism Coleridge exemplifies an emphasis on practical reason as the basis of political judgments in APT and inaugurates a focus on history and forms of life as the primary loci of inquiry. Natural law, doctrine, Scripture, and philosophy may well be vital elements in the subsequent development of a moral or political position, but attention to ways of imagining life together is what initiates and provides an essential reference point for Coleridge, and by extension, APT. Later in the nineteenth century, the educator and historian Thomas Arnold (1795–1842), the theologian and one of the founders of Christian socialism F. D. Maurice (1805–72), and liberal politician and prime minister William Gladstone (1809–1898) further developed Coleridge’s ideas, and they, in turn, influenced Christian socialists and liberals. In the contemporary context, we can discern the watermark of Coleridge’s concerns, particularly his emphasis on the role of culture, history, and the imagination in shaping the good life, in figures such as Desmond Tutu, Sarah Coakley, Kathryn Tanner, Graham Ward, and Elaine Graham. Even Oliver O’Donovan, for whom Scripture and doctrine are central to the articulation of his political theology, still makes history (notably, intellectual history) and contextually situated prudential judgments a constitutive feature of his methodology. Indeed, O’Donovan’s understanding of creation in many ways echoes that developed by Coleridge. ([Location 3769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=3769))

- In a gesture that has since become characteristic of Anglican theology, Coleridge rejected a notion of natural law as that which can be excavated by reason alone. Instead, he saw creation as an open yet unfinished cosmos, the value of which is not objectively given but depends on the human capacity to participate in it via symbolic processes of meaning making. That is to say, the human self stands in an interpretative and constantly evolving relationship to creation.4 Thus, overly abstract kinds of reasoning render humans not only mere spectators but also spectral beings alienated from any actual form of life. By contrast, close attention to, participation in, and openhearted wonder about the world around us can generate imaginative visions for inhabiting creation in more nourishing, concrete, and profound ways. The world as it is can then be brought into conversation with and reimagined through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as narrated in Scripture.

- Hooker developed an early and influential view of the church-nation relationship and how to articulate it within state structures. He assumed that the populace of the commonwealth and the laity were one and the same, with Parliament being a synod of the laity.9 In Hooker, this paradigm is aligned with a conception of the ideal polity as being modeled on the “Hebrew Commonwealth” and constituted by one people, one religion, and one law under God. This is a form of integralism. The danger with it is that it converts a contingent relation into a providential necessity by presuming that there should be an organic unity between the people of God and the English people.

- More recently, internal debates within the Anglican Communion over issues such as same-sex marriage have generated questions about the constitution and distribution of power within the communion.

- This shift, combined with an intensification of ethnic and religious diversity due to inward migration from former colonies, pressed the question of what it means for the church to negotiate a common life with various Christian and non-Christian others, while at the same time negotiating a constructive but critical relationship to the state and the market.13 Should the state still be the point of unity with the nation? And what makes a nation? These questions came to be aligned with a critique of secularism. Rather than accepting a determination of the secular as that-which-is-not-religious, a more theological and historically attuned one emerged.14 This defined the secular as that-which-is-not-eschatological. The secular thereby becomes identified as an ambivalent space and time constructed through the interaction of multiple forms of belief and unbelief. The church is neither for nor against what is secular (understood as that-which-is-not-eschatological), neither is the church reducible to a separate (and private) “religious” sphere.15 Rather, state and nation should be “faithfully… ([Location 3847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=3847))

- The life and writings of John Locke exemplify the connection between APT, the Atlantic world, and colonial rule. As secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–1674) and, later, a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), Locke was a well-informed observer of the interactions shaping the Atlantic world of the late seventeenth century. And as a shareholder in the Royal African Company, a key catalyst in the formation of the Atlantic slave trade, he actively invested in this world. Intellectually, Locke’s defense of individual rights and liberties is correctly hailed as a fountainhead of liberalism. Yet, as exemplified in the Fundamental Constitutions of the Carolinas, adopted in 1669, he was part of a milieu that sought to legitimize, philosophically and in practice, patrician rule throughout the emerging colonies. And, as James Tully argues, Locke’s work came to serve as an ideological justification for the expropriation of lands from America’s indigenous peoples.

- In providential theologies of history, however, wisdom may be found in the world such that Christians should examine the status quo and existing institutional configurations sympathetically. The emphasis on history and culture seen in Coleridge was part of this providential orientation, although such an orientation generated two contradictory readings of history—one conservative, the other progressive.

- A further example is Edmund Burke’s (1729–1797) repeated stress on the need to counteract imperial power’s tendency to abuse by having in place structures of accountability, legal protections of subjects, and restraint in the exercise of power. Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990), following in the footsteps of Burke, argued that a conservative approach is more reliably humane, for conservatives “prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss.”29 Yet conservativism is also slower to acknowledge the arbitrariness and injustice of who does and who does not have power, and quicker to conflate penultimate and prudential ends with providential ones.

- The social vision of conservative providentialism can caustically—but not inaccurately—be summarized thus: the rich should set a good example and act benevolently to those less fortunate than themselves, while the poor (whether at home or abroad) “should remain poor, but suffer less, worship more, and behave better.”30 That said, its paternalist interventionism contrasts with those who, following the lead of William Paley (1743–1805) and Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), aligned Christian notions of providence with laissez-faire economics, and held that only the “deserving poor” should receive charity.

- The conservative providentialist view entails the interdependence of a good society with “vital religion.” William Wilberforce’s A Practical View (1797) forcefully expresses this idea. For Wilberforce, church and nation stand or fall together, and both are under the judgment of God. In his view, Christianity is the essential basis for social harmony and good government. By contrast, the loss of “vital religion” leads to loss of respect for authority and chaos. This is a common trope in conservative providentialist views: the abandonment of Christianity leads to immorality, nihilism, and the collapse of the social order, and brings God’s judgment on the nation for failing to fulfill its vocation. At such a time, what is required are well-educated, faithful men of character—and it… ([Location 3968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=3968))

- Progressive providentialism comes to prominence under the influence of idealism in the nineteenth century. As with the conservative Wilberforce, progressive providentialists were equally concerned about the moral development of individuals and social harmony. However, in contrast to Wilberforce and the evangelicals who followed in his wake, they emphasized the need for structural reform to enable these goods to emerge. Yet structural changes were only ever secondary to a primary ideal of spiritual fellowship. A more fundamental point of contrast with Wilberforce and his ilk was an emphasis on the immanent work of God through social life rather than through individual conversion and responsibility. The individual is envisaged as part of a larger whole, with freedom being attained through social cooperation, which in turn embodied the divine purpose in history. Theologically, a strong emphasis on the incarnation undergirded their idealism. As Henry Scott Holland (1847–1918) put it in his 1911 Christian Social Union pamphlet Our Neighbors: “If we believe in the Incarnation, then we certainly believe in the entry of God into the very thick of human affairs.

However, the modernity-critical stream of Augustinianism Figgis helps initiate contradicts Augustine, for whom this noneschatological age was a field of wheat and tares. It works with and reifies an epochal division between modernity and prior ages, and through this division introduces a dangerous nostalgia that sacralizes the past (often an idealized medieval era) and demonizes the present. On this kind of account, Christianity either becomes an endangered species to be protected on special reservations or a weapon to defend Western culture from internal collapse and external attack.

- a time and place beyond human conflict, when the basis of what leads to human tears and suffering will be transcended and God will establish a harmonious communion with humans and all creation. The shorthand we use for this time and place includes the phrases the “peaceable kingdom,” the “city of God,” and the “new creation.” In its life together, the church is to bear witness to this time and place. One way of pointing to and anticipating this coming communion is by sharing the peace through a kiss, handshake, or some other gesture. As a physical gesture, sharing the peace makes a claim about how reality can and should be structured, thereby signifying how the church embodies rather than merely has a political theology, its practices constituting a form of political witness. Or at least that is part of what I will argue here. ([Location 4184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=4184))

- The background political question I address in this chapter is, what are the conditions of agency? Class relations, whether in a congregation or elsewhere, are an important factor that structure the ability to act. They shape who has more or less power. As a background condition, class as a means of agency is often invisible and therefore unaccountable. It works in unconscious ways to shape judgments about what to do and what not to do. Worship is also a means of agency, both in divine-human relations and between humans. In what follows, I map how worship and class interact, both positively and negatively, to construct or diminish the ability to act with and for others in sustaining a common life. The interaction of class and worship provides a window on how the church qua church both counters and perpetuates unjust social, political, and economic hierarchies.

- For Irenaeus, creation is good but unfulfilled: it does not arrive ex nihilo in full bloom but must grow up and mature so that it might then receive its perfection in Christ. The Fall constitutes a turn away from growth into maturity and results in humans walking backward into chaos and nothingness. Jesus Christ redeems creation by restoring creation to its original goodness (first movement), and then enabling creation, through the perfecting actions of the Spirit, to once more move into its fulfillment (second movement). This double movement involves both action through time (chronos) and action in time (kairos). The perfection of creation is not immanent to itself—it is not an outworking of what was present at the beginning—so there is no need to return to the point of origin. Rather, God gives fulfillment eschatologically. Therefore, there is no movement back to an original state or Edenic condition—as Origen argues—but a movement forward, through time, to perfection, a perfection inaugurated by the actions of Christ and the Spirit at the ascension wherein God takes up the material creation into the triune life. In Irenaeus’s eschatology, the emphasis is not on space (that is, a move beyond creation) but on time: the advent of the kingdom of God involves a movement to a new time through the existing creation.

- The coinherence of theological and economic semantic registers raises two questions. The first is whether our “little” economies, whatever form they take—capitalist, socialist, etc.—serve God’s oikonomia. To this end, is it the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ that mold our understandings of economy, or vice versa? Can the biblical stories, metaphors, and language of redemption from debt slavery, as well as the patterns of relationship envisioned in Jubilee, Sabbath rest, covenant, and koinōnia, be drawn on to reimagine what economic life amid our salvation means? And through a process of reimagining economics, can we convert rather than conform to our little earthly economies?

- The second question follows on from this initial set of questions. It asks how faith, hope, and love can embed and order economic relations even as they circulate through them. Implicit within this question is a refusal to establish false binaries between, say, love and money, or gift and debt. Rather than seeing money or debt as inherently immoral or polluting, what is important is the right ordering of their use. This is not to say that money and debt are neutral or uncomplicated; even their right use sets up numerous moral hazards.

- In relation to recollection/restoration, money as a means of conversion does not recover or display a thing’s true or original value; indeed, it operates by turning something into an abstract, exchangeable commodity. Neither does it enable newness: rather than new birth on the pattern of resurrection, where there is a paradoxical relation of continuity and change, money demands the complete discarding of a thing’s prior material and affective life. For example, money as a means of conversion renders who we are, our relationships, and history as irrelevant, alienating what we do (our labor that can be exchanged in the marketplace) from who we are as persons. Even more significantly, money converts everything into the same and so sublates difference (everything becomes a commodity). In this regard, Jesus is the opposite of money: in Christ, through the Spirit, each part of creation is both healed and redirected to its consummation. The result is that it is enabled to be its own unique and specific kind of thing, so that its original value can be appreciated and can enter into communion with every other kind of created thing in its own particular way. This involves not the discarding of materiality or the forgetting of history, but their transfiguration. ([Location 6823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=6823))

- Commercial and credit-debt relations become immoral when they cease to be rooted in prior and superordinate relations of mutuality. When relations of interdependence they articulate are exploited to extract more than is owed, both morally and economically, debt and commerce become unjust. This is the problem with usury as a sinful and idolatrous form of debt relation. Again, the decisive issue is not debt per se, but the quality and character of the relationship between lender and borrower. Usury (the extortionate charging of interest) converts relations of mutuality, which credit-debt relations can be constitutive of, and converts them into relations of exploitative extraction.

It can be pursued without end, and in the process, everything else is subordinated to its accumulation.

- While money is necessary as either a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a means of accounting, the practice of chrematistics or moneymaking (as distinct from its use for production and trade) threatens the polis because it makes the pursuit of profit an end in itself, and in doing so not only turns money from its proper end but also, through pleonexia, becomes the enemy of citizenship because it undermines the pursuit of civic virtue and justice. The pursuit of money/profit/capital as an end rather than as a means of exchange or an aid to further production or trade undermines the virtues of courage and justice necessary to pursue the truly good life and sustain the freedom of the body politic that is the condition of the pursuit of such a life. The collective liberty of self-governing citizens and their virtuous pursuit of common goods are undermined by commercial and competitive values that prioritize the self-interested pursuit of private property and consumer goods.

- The depersonalization of debt and the formation of an abstract monetary space emerge in Europe from the seventeenth century onward and involve a coalescence of commercial and monarchical interest as well as a delicate balance of power between them.20 Ingham suggests that in the shift from credit to commodity money or cash, centralizing sovereign and often imperial authorities play a crucial role: they monopolize the issuing and production of money for the purposes of taxation and the provisioning of armies. Money moves from being a way of tracking credit and debt relations between persons (and thereby interpersonal) to becoming a way for sovereigns to manage what subjects are said to owe the state, backed up by coercive measures if necessary.

- These thinkers drew a distinction between noncoercive and commercial lending on the one hand, and forms of extortionate and exploitative lending on the other.22 The fundamental issue was whether the lending relationship involves reciprocity, equitable relations, and shared risk.23 On this account, the charging of interest is licit when it is noncoercive and involves just relations and mutual benefit rather than selfish gain. When it becomes coercive and fundamentally alters the relationship between lender and borrower, then it pertains to the public order of a polity and the question of who legitimately can exercise coercive force. At this point, legislation is required to protect the weaker party in the exchange. The most consistent and long-standing example of this kind of protection is a cap on interest rates (such legislation dates back to the oldest legal code archeology has discovered, the Laws of Hammurabi). Legislative limits on interest rates are necessary to stop the conversion of indebtedness into debt bondage, thereby dissolving the conditions for equitable relations between members of the same body politic.

- In debates about usury, up to and including the time of the Reformation, the linkage between debt and the ability to sustain citizenship as a form of koinōnia (fellowship) was well understood. However, with the emergence of the social contract tradition of modern political thought, there was a shift away from a view of citizenship as a form of koinōnia. This shift entailed moving away from seeing property as a communicative good toward a contractual view in which notions of absolute and exclusive ownership determine conceptions of property. Citizenship eventually becomes located within a vision of “possessive individualism” in which freedom is a zero-sum game, with individual freedom no longer premised on interdependent relations that seek fulfillment in mutual flourishing.

This self-imagining underwrites vast swathes of the American political economy and stigmatizes the poor as immoral and feckless.

- In the contemporary context, good citizenship and political order are not seen to be threatened by usurious forms of personal and national debt. Yet, because debt is said to be voluntarily chosen, the liberal social contract tradition cannot recognize how debt can be a means of domination. Within the context of finance-centric forms of capitalism, debt is divorced from mutuality and used to subjugate, command, manage, order, and normalize particular behaviors.28 For example, student debts direct graduates “voluntarily” into certain streams of employment and away from lower-paying yet more vocational and politicized forms of work. The social means of citizenship (public housing, education, health care, and so on) are ceasing to be provided by the state and funded by tax revenues. Instead, they are outsourced to the “private” sector and paid for by taking on debt (individually, or at the municipal or national level). Rather than the state providing the means of agency so that citizens may act with political and economic parity in relation to others, public and common goods such as housing, education, and health care provided by regimes of indebtedness create dependency and vulnerability, concentrating power in the hands of those who control the means of credit.

On the contrary, it has always understood this right within the broader context of the right common to all to use the goods of the whole of creation: the right to private property is subordinated to the right to common use, to the fact that goods are meant for everyone.” ([Location 7004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=7004))

Like Babylon, capitalism is a symbol, structure, and culture of rule that stands apocalyptically under judgment.

And yet, like all forms of empire, alongside the decadent and the damned, it is capable of producing things of great scientific merit and technological sophistication, as well as precious artifacts of immense beauty. As a regime, it can take very different forms around the world, even as each of these forms has a tentacular global reach. These different forms of capitalism are present at different concentrations in different places.

- My prescriptive judgment is that economic democracy needs massive extension. This extension is possible through such measures as the representation of workers on pension remuneration boards; active trade union and shareholder involvement in corporate governance; alternative and local financial institutions such as credit unions, regional banks, and Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS); and other forms of economic democracy such as community-supported agriculture and fisheries, community land trusts, fair trade schemes, guilds and professional associations, and consumer associations. Such measures depend on maintaining reciprocal relations and enable sharing profits, distributing power, and prioritizing social over political and economic relations. This latter “mark” reflects the self-ascribed names such ventures adopt in the modern period: friendly societies, cooperatives, mutuals, credit unions, and social insurance.

This inability affected the holiness of the people, because the quality of covenantal relations broke down. Without land, tzedakah u’mishpat (justice and righteousness), the term for the complex of obligations and rights that forms the basis of the God-given social order, could no longer be fulfilled.7 Thus the land in general, and familial landholdings in particular, were central to the organization and identity of ancient Israel as a body politic/people.

- The primary difference between Israel as a people (‘am, laos) and other peoples or nations (gôy, ethnē) is not material but formal.8 The material life of Israel is both like and not like that of other peoples, but their end—that of covenantal relationship with God—is radically different. This formal, teleological difference is what makes it incumbent, so the theological claim goes, for all other nations to respond to Israel in appropriate ways. This end also means that the material and institutional life of the people is not static. It can be subject to radical revision in the light of what it means to fulfill the covenant. The Christian theological claim is that after Christ, the people of God includes representatives from among the nations. In effect, the eschatological vision presented in Isaiah and elsewhere is reaffirmed in the Gospels, most explicitly in Luke 13:29–30, where Jesus declares that “people will come from east and west, from north and south, and will eat in the kingdom of God.

- Protestant forms of phyletism are common, but today these are mostly related to a vaguer sense of being a “Christian” or “Judeo-Christian” nation rather than a “Lutheran” or “Reformed” nation. This shift represents a movement beyond phyletism, as the linkage between “the people” and Christianity no longer denotes a connection between the nation and a specific form of belief and practice. Instead, Christianity becomes a symbol untethered from doctrinal or ethical content, and so is thereby reduced to a civil religious trope deployed to buttress an exclusionary national identity.20 Theologically, this shift represents a move from heresy to idolatry. Politically, it converts Christianity into a form of identity politics. ([Location 8483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8483))

The construction of holiness occurs through such things as ascetic practices, collective worship, patterns of gift relation and shared experience, memories, and narratives, which combine to form the constitutive elements of a “holy nation.” This holy nation is, paradoxically, a people who are “resident aliens”; that is, they are unbound by commitment to territory.

- A populist impulse is a perennial feature of Christianity. It is born out of a sense that the renewal of relationship to God and the righteousness of the church come through direct, supposedly unmediated access to God. As already noted, arguments for direct access pose the reading of Scripture or the work of the Spirit in opposition to encounter with God mediated by representatives (exemplified in the administration of sacraments). This theological and ecclesial populism generates opposition to clerical and political elites, who are seen to usurp God and rule either in their own interests or in the service of idols, and thereby corrupt the people by leading them astray.

This theological debate is the backdrop to the emergence of the “Westphalian order” of liberal-democratic nation-states, which established the reformist strain of republicanism as the hegemonic one.

- In a democracy, the people speak and act. But how? And who is it who speaks and acts? In answering these questions, the first thing to note is that a people is always internally differentiated (not everyone is the same), under construction (who is part of the people is always changing), and only ever imagined and seen in part. The people can be staged at a rally or assembly or represented in a parliament and can appear in various physical spaces (squares, streets, courtrooms) and gestures (voting, demonstrating, occupying).

- Peoplehood is a form of self-articulation that is not coterminous with either the institutions of representation such as a congress or parliament or the movements and modes of contestation such as a rally or parade. Authorizing any claim to represent “the will” of the people is not at base a legal procedure. Authority for such a claim comes from the degree to which it resonates with the long, slow accretion of customary practices, bodily proprieties, symbolic gestures, and genres of speech that coalesce to form a set of normative expectations that shape the imagination of a people about what constitutes a legitimate performance and representation of peoplehood.

- As Oliver O’Donovan notes: A people is a complex of social constituents: of local societies, determined by the common inhabitation of a place; of institutions, such as universities, banks, and industries; of communities of specialist function, such as laborers, artists, teachers, financiers; of families; and of communities of enthusiasm such as sports clubs and musical organisations. To have identity as a people is to be able to conceive the whole that embraces these various constituents practically, as a coordinated agency. When it is no longer possible to discern the constituent elements within the whole, each with its stock of tradition, its reserves of memory, and its communal habits of practice, then the whole dissolves before our eyes. It also dissolves when it is no longer possible to think of these elements as acting, in some sense, together and for one another.46 ([Location 8692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8692))
- The legitimacy of a claim to speak for the people is always contestable, and, contrary to a class or a nation—which tends to be monistic—the people is a pluralistic political subject. The claim to represent the interests of the people, or to embody the people, is to voice a claim that what makes for thriving among these people, in this place, at this time, needs recalibrating. Inherent in such a claim is another claim that flourishing cannot be achieved through fulfilling the needs of the one (the individual), the few (a faction or vanguard), or even the many (a class or nation). It can only be achieved through pursuing goods in common. As such, “we, the people” is a teleological, moral claim about the form of those goods that unite and serve the flourishing of the people as a whole.

- To borrow Laura Grattan’s term, it is more helpful to talk of “peopling” than peoplehood. Talk of peoplehood too easily slips into the same problem that affects talk of “the nation”: it imagines an abstract, static collective subject as the expression of an organic, supposedly prepolitical spirit, essence, or identity. For Grattan, peopling names the convergence between “ongoing practices and the moments when new political actors come out of the shadows to contest the terms of the people and democracy.”48 Peopling is an ongoing, active process of becoming a people that connects horizontal experiments in everyday and radical democratic politics with vertical, hegemonic structures and discourses that order and frame the common life of a polity, thereby contesting and reconfiguring them.

- An alternative beginning point for democratic theory from individual autonomy is to start with the relationships between individuals. If democracy is the rule of the people, by the people, and for the people, then at its most basic level it demands relationships between those who constitute the people. Without meaningful relationships between people, there are just individuals and an atomized and disaggregated crowd. If one begins with relationships—and thence their mediation via custom, gift relations, and self-organized institutions—then one must take seriously the forms of social life through which individuals develop and sustain relationships over time. It is within these forms of life that we learn the art of making and responding appropriately to authoritative judgments about what to do and how to do it (or ruling and being ruled). This starting point for thinking about democracy is not in opposition to individual liberty; it recognizes that individual liberty depends on multiple forms of association and different kinds of relationship.

At the same time, politics is a means by which to order those relationships so that all may flourish. Beginning with ongoing patterns of contingent but necessary forms of sociality that are open to change foregrounds how relationships between persons take multiple forms, and the complex rather than simple nature of social and political space. Diverse centers of social formation and political power not only provide a check on totalizing forms of power but also make meaningful the ability of enmeshed persons to foster the multiple forms of association (and thence loyalties) they need to flourish.

- Interpretations of populism reflect the contradictory responses to the people: the people are vicious and virtuous, irrational and bearers of a nation’s true spirit, a threat to democracy and the holders of sovereignty. Critics of populism see it as an aberration that unless it is prevented or punctured will poison a liberal democratic body politic. Against such a view, I contend that populism is an inherent, and often benign, feature of democratic politics; yet, as with all forms of politics, it can become toxic.

- Populism is a sponge that soaks up the ideological spills and stains that surround it.64 ([Location 8837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8837))
- When “people” refers to a community of blood or race or a homogenous conception of a shared culture, populism aligns itself with racist and xenophobic ideologies. Similarly, populism can incorporate religious beliefs and practices: for example, the anticommunist revolution instigated by Solidarity in Poland drew heavily on Roman Catholicism. Regarding political organization, populists can build loose networks as well as formal party structures.66 In short, populism merges with more “established” ideologies and discursive frameworks as part of a broader vision of restoring democracy and government to the people.

- Within many critical readings, “populism” becomes a term of abuse whereby the common folk are labeled uneducated, vulgar, and simplistic in contrast to cultivated, educated elites—the former should not be allowed to rule, whereas the latter are the rightful rulers. ([Location 8863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8863))
- But there is a latent antidemocratic suspicion among critics of populism about whether ordinary people can be allowed to govern. If they do govern, critics wonder, will they coarsen political life and generate chaotic or ruinous policies? This reflects an ancient concern that reaches back to the elites of Greece and Rome. However, there is a converse suspicion that elites are incapable of serving goods in common and instead serve only elite interests. In response, common people must give priority to and value the ordinary, the vulgar, and what is popular, as these are not merely a check on the dominance of elite interests and tastes in a democracy but are the source of a moral and political wisdom that elites ignore or disdain. The myopia of elites leads them to embark on projects of social engineering that destroy the lives of ordinary people in the name of lifting them up. They pursue policies (for example, trickle-down economics) that are proclaimed as benefiting everyone when they mostly benefit the privileged and powerful.

- Following the pioneering work of the political theorists Margaret Canovan and Ernesto Laclau, populism should not be seen as something inherently dangerous, and thus as a phenomenon to be rejected, but as playing off tensions within democracy itself.73 For Canovan, populism is a contextual phenomenon that reacts to whatever is hegemonic.74 And in the context of modern liberal democracies, populism is an inherent possibility born out… ([Location 8880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8880))
- Building on Canovan, a constructive way to distinguish between different kinds of populism is to distinguish between a “populist democratic politics” and “antipolitical” forms of populism. A populist democratic politics attempts to construct a common life not by denying friend-enemy distinctions but, via a heightened process of conflict and conciliation, by generating a richer sense of what is the good of the whole body politic. An antipolitical populism refuses the possibilities of a common… ([Location 8888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8888))

- By contrast, antipolitical populism seeks to simplify the political space rather than render it more complex. It advocates direct forms of democracy in order to circumvent the need for deliberative processes and the representation of multiple interests in the formation of political judgments. The leader rules by direct consent without the hindrance of checks and balances or the representation of different interests. In antipolitical populism, throwing off established authority structures is the prelude to giving over authority to the one and giving up responsibility for the commons. The goal of antipolitical populism is personal withdrawal from public life so as to be free to pursue private self-interests rather than public mutual interests.76 In antipolitical expressions of populism, personal responsibility is for improvement of the self, one’s immediate family, institution (e.g., a… ([Location 8895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=8895))

- However, the critical differences between a populist democratic politics and antipolitical populism are fivefold. A populist democratic politics: puts populist orientations and sentiments in the service of forging a shared political space—not limiting it, subverting it, or closing it down; invests in long-term organization and education (e.g., the role of the “lecturer” in the Populist Movement and the “organizer” in community organizing); develops a broad base of local leaders rather than relying on one charismatic leader and short-term mobilization of people who are focused not on loyalty to each other and a common life but on loyalty to the single leader and the cause or issue;77 frames proposals as moral imperatives but at the same time sees compromise as “a key and beautiful word”;78 and reconstitutes the sense of what it means to be a people in a way that incorporates rather than demonizes those considered other. In short, populist democratic politics seeks to generate a common life as against a politics dominated by the interests of the one, the few, or the many. Populism corrupts the people when it claims to wholly identify the people with the interests of a part rather than the common. And as a general rule, while populist movements can be democratic or contain strong democratic elements, populism as a regime of statecraft is rarely, if ever, democratic, as it quickly degenerates into a form of authoritarianism.

- The account of democracy given here must be situated within the broader vision articulated throughout this book. This vision can be briefly summarized as the need for a democratized economy, in a confederal polity, with a pluralistic common life politics, undergirded by a moral commitment to generating forms of shared flourishing that are ecologically attuned.

- To be sustained, any attempt to ensure that market and state processes serve human and ecological flourishing requires the kind of common life, pluralistic, democratic politics outlined here. ([Location 9559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=9559))
- The participatory and agitational practices of democratic politics are a way to ensure that those who possess the levers of unilateral power, whether in the state or in the market, are held accountable, while at the same time ensuring that the means of accountability embody the change that is sought.

- In short, any kind of politics, even democratic politics, becomes pitiless if it fails to cultivate virtue, moral vision, and denies the human need for rest, play, and contemplation. ([Location 9569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=9569))
- Conversely, the pursuit of virtue, moral vision, and rest, play, and contemplation without any broader conception and engagement in democratic politics is pitiful, as it has no means to protect and pursue the very relationships and activities it loves and values most in the face of either their instrumentalization, commodification, or repression. Democratic politics thus conceived is a work of love. Absent love and it does not work. ([Location 9570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SV6QFCF&location=9570))
