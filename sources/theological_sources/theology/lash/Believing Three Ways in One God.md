### Highlights

- ‘Amen’ comes after, and the context of its utterance is usually a solemn act of worship. It is a people-binding act, a pledge of solidarity with the purposes and promises of God. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=63))
- As we work to act a little less clumsily, less inhumanly, less thoughtlessly; to speak a little less ignorantly, less dishonestly, less inattentively, there is always much to say and even more to do. Only God speaks one Word which says everything, which makes and heals the world. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=73))
- It sometimes seems that there is not, nor can there ever be, in principle, an end in sight: a time to say ‘Amen’. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=77))
- Growing up is largely a matter of learning to take bearings. A more fruitful question than ‘Where should we begin?’ would almost always be ‘Where, then, do we stand?’. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=85))

- genetic solidarity, as we might call it, is not enough to warrant the claim that all human beings share one common nature. Human animals do not only breed, feed and make social arrangements (although they do, in common with other species, do all these things). We also tell stories and dream dreams, consider alternatives and make plans for the future. In other words, human culture, woven from the meanings and values that inform our ways of life, forms part of human nature. Therefore, the unity of human nature requires that all members of the species share a common culture: a common life, responsibility and understanding, a common memory and a common hope. And this, for the most part, we so far fail to do. It follows that the oneness or unity of human nature, the way this species hangs together, is far from being merely a biological datum. It is also a permanent ethical task and political responsibility. We share one nature in the measure that we are one people, members of one another.

- Moreover, in order thus to understand the way things hang together – or fail to do so – in the human world, it is by no means necessary to suffer from the illusion that there is some universal viewpoint, situated nowhere and inhabited by no one in particular, from which questions of unity and difference can be contemplated. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=137))
- Thus, cultural imperialism ‘sees’ that we are all the same (or must be made to be so, if we are to rise above the darkness of barbarian error), while relativism ‘sees’ that we are simply different. None of us, in fact, is that far-sighted. We see what we can, from where we are. Feeling our way forward in the dark, seeking to get our bearings, what is required of us is attentiveness, patience and the willingness to learn. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=139))
- Both imperialism and relativism take an easier option, surrendering the requirements continually to test all stories, the need to be self-critical, genuinely attentive to ways of interpreting and acting out the world, to habits of inference, evaluation and imagination, significantly different from one’s own. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=142))
- The most difficult tales to test are not those that we know ourselves to tell as tales, but those that we inhabit. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=146))
- I intend, so far as possible, to take ‘myth’, neutrally, to refer to those comprehensive, self-contained narrations of the world within which and according to whose rhythms people live their lives, execute their projects, sustain the ambition and the terror of their dreams. It is this mythic use of narrative I have in mind when speaking of ‘the tales that we inhabit’. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=149))
- Christianity finds its myth in Scripture and distils it in the Creed. We shall need to discuss this way of putting it and also to consider whether it implies that the Creed is, itself, a narrative. For the time being, it is enough to make the general point that the oneness or identity of Christian faith, the way things hang together in the Christian scheme of things, has more in common with the oneness of a story with a single plot than with the oneness of a catalogue or list of objects of belief. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=157))
- The creeds were shaped by controversy and, as we shall see, their very form is such as to furnish a pattern of self-correction or restraint upon the range of their misuse. The way things hang together, in the Christian scheme of things, is through this ceaseless labour of mutual correction. This may seem a restless or exhausting kind of unity and yet, as we proceed, I shall suggest that it is better seen as the unending and usually discordant labour of people learning to make music, to move closer to the harmony of God, in whom alone all things hold still. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=166))
- Creeds serve to sustain the identity and oneness of the Christian church in obedience to the One confessed as God and in service of the oneness of the world and of the human race. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01D4TAYT0&location=172))
