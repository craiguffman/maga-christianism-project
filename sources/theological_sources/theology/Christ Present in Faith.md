### Highlights

- Mannermaa points out in Luther's theology a heretofore neglected emphasis on the real, reality-altering presence of God that occurs along with the act of imputation, in which the believer is made righteous and thus one with God. In other words, in his interpretation of Luther's language, Mannermaa maintains that Luther gives equal emphasis to both the "forensic" and the "effective" sides of righteousness, to how justification means both being declared forgiven before God and being made holy in a personal union with God. Mannermaa's work shows how the language of imputation and forensic justification cannot do justice to the entirety of Luther's theology of justification (or reveal his potential as a spiritual teacher). He demonstrates that, for Luther, justification has real effects; that Christ the Redeemer does not operate only for us but also in us. The depth of Luther's theology of justification by faith cannot be appreciated fully without coming to appropriate conclusions about what it means in reality when Christ comes to live in us and makes us one with God-and thus, in a sense, gods. Needless to say, such a statement in Lutheran circles is prone to cause a stir. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=71))
- If Mannermaa's attention to what is traditionally called the "effective side of righteousness" is already controversial, even more so is his suggestion, or rather thesis, that the idea of divinization, theosis, is a central part of Luther's theology and particularly of the doctrine of justification.Mannermaa argues for this concisely and convincingly, drawing his evidence from Luther himself. Mannermaa states that the concept of participation in God (theosis) is inherent in all of Luther's theology. And indeed, Luther speaks frequently about "God's indwelling" or "inhabitation" in the human being (e.g.) WA 4:280, 2-5; WA 3:106, 14-15). The focus in Luther is not on what a human becomes but on what is done "to" the human being and what this means to the human being in relation to God: deification is about participation in God, the focus being on God's act.2 ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=78))
- for Luther "theosis is based causally on the divinity of God." It comes to the believer, initiated by God, through a "nihilization" that destroys one's constant effort tomake oneself god and to justify oneself? For Luther, divinization has to do with God's own way of being the loving God who comes to the world in the Word: "God is in relation to himself in the movement of the Word (Deum Patrem sibi suum apud se verbum proferre) at the same time that he is this movement of the Word. This understanding of the being of God is the basis for understanding the being-present-of-Christ in faith."' A beautiful quote from Luther used by Mannermaa says it well: "Thus the righteousness of Christ becomes our righteousness through faith in Christ, and everything that is his, even he himself, becomes ours ... and he who believes in… ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=83))
- Using the language of divinization and union with God and talking about a new reality that comes with justification, Luther's theology sounds mystical and essentially in tune with both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic views on what happens to human beings in… ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=89))
- As characterized in the introduction to that book, the "Mannermaa school is revising a century of Luther interpretation dominated by German Protestant theologians, who notoriously read Luther under the spell of neo-Kantian presuppositions. This is true of a long line of… ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=105))
- Mannermaa has challenged their rejection of the idea of ontological participation with his reading of Luther's central idea that "in faith itself Christ is really present," with the emphasis being on the words "really present." Arguing from Luther's Christology, which draws from the teachings of the early church and patristic theology, Mannermaa shows exactly how "ontological" it is for Luther that Christ is in and for us-really, truly, and personally. From this christological starting point, Luther can… ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=110))
- Mannermaa posits that ontological language is exactly the language needed to present what Luther is actually saying, whether it is about God's presence in the believer, Christ's communicatio idiomatum in the act of justification, or about the effect of the sacraments. Reading Luther in his medieval context and not trying to make him stand in opposition to the mystical tradition, Mannermaa reveals the ontological dimension of Luther's… ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=114))
- The work argues for and centers on Luther's radical insight about justification being a godly act of divinization that changes a person's relationship with God ontologically. Arguing in light of the Orthodox teaching of theosis, Mannermaa proves through systematic reading of Luther that the idea of divinization, which happens because of Christ and in faith, is at the heart of Luther's theology. Not only offering an occasion for ecumenical mutual understanding of the basics of Christian faith, it dramatically shifts the central emphasis in Lutheran theology and thus spirituality. As said before, this perspective changes the emphasis from talk about "declared" righteousness and forgiveness to talk about "made righteous" and holy, emphasizing not only Christ as a "favor" but also as a "gift," ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=153))
- one needs to notice that the presumption that has dominated Protestant scholarship and has considered the doctrines of divinization and justification as in sharp contrast to each other is based on certain premises that have emerged in the course of the history of modern theology. I would like to mention here two of these premises: first of all, the influence of Kant and neo-Kantianism, which has resulted in the view that the relationship of a human being with God should be seen as an "ethical relation"; secondly, the influence of kerygmatic theology, affected by the understanding of kerygma in dialectical theology. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=167))
- From its own standpoint, apart from these Protestant assumptions, the core of the Orthodox doctrine of divinization can bedescribed as follows: The divine life has been revealed in Christ. In the communion of the church, which is the body of Christ, human beings become participants in this divine life. In this way, they become partakers of the "divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). This "nature,"… ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=173))
- the concept of participation in the divine life in Christ is at the core of the doctrine of divinization. In patristic thinking, the idea of divinization was often expressed through concepts that were taken from Greek ontology. This does not mean, however, that the doctrine itself could be labeled entirely Hellenistic, as was suggested by the Ritschlian school. This Ritschlian thesis relied, in essence, on a philosophical premise according to which the "physical" relationship with God, based on the union of "being," must be categorically kept apart from the "personal-ethical" relation to God. In patristic thinking itself, however, the "ethical" and the "ontological" were not separated in this modern fashion. Thus, the doctrine of divinization rests on the presupposition that the human being can actually participate in the fullness… ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=177))
- Without pursuing the question whether the technical term "divinization" can genuinely and appropriately express the whole of the patristic and Orthodox doctrine of salvation, in this work the term is used to express the more or less established view of salvation of the early church from which the christological dogma developed. The… ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=182))
- I am aware of the fact that "divinization" is not the only basic term to sum up and characterize the understanding of Christian faith as represented by Athanasius. Jaroslav Pelikan, for example, understands theosis as "transformation" An interesting critique of this view, in turn, has been presented by Dietrich Ritschl. For Pelikan, the central principle of the theology of Athanasius is the symbol of light. For this reason, Ritschl suggests, in a study on Athanasius dedicated to the Russian theologian Vitaly Borovoy,4that it would have been more consistent of Pelikan to use the word "transfiguration" for divinization. This suggestion is of significance because in 1977, in the Finnish-Russian theological discussions held in Kiev, the same Vitaly Borovoy presented an interpretation of the entirety… ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=184))
- When one looks for the motifs in Lutheran theology analogous to the concept of divinization, one's attention is drawn to the fact that Lutheran theology and tradition is undoubtedly familiar with the notion of God's essential indwelling in the believer (inhabitatio Dei). The classic quotation on this inhabitatio is found in the Formula of Concord (FC), which is one of the Lutheran confessional texts (1577). According to this passage, God, in the very fullness of God's essence, is present in those who believe in God.It is important to recognize that… ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=197))
- In its argument that the presence of the Trinity in faith is not the same phenomenon as the "righteousness of faith," the FC draws on the later theology of Melanchthon, on which much of Lutheran theology after Luther has relied. In the theology of the FC, justification is understood in a one-sidedly forensic manner, that is, only as a reception of the forgiveness that is "imputed" to Christians for the sake of the obedience and merit of Christ.… ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=209))
- In the theology of Luther, however, the relation between justification and the divine indwelling in the believer is defineddifferently. Luther's notion of the "righteousness of faith" is permeated by christological thinking. He does not separate the person (persona) of Christ and his work (officium) from each other. Instead, Christ himself, both his person and his work, is the Christian righteousness, that is, the "righteousness of faith." Christ-and therefore also his entire person and work-is really and truly present in the faith itself (in ipsa fide Christus adest). The favor (favor) of God (i.e., the forgiveness of sins and the removal of God's wrath) and his "gift" (donum; God himself, present in the fullness of his essence) unite in the person of Christ. At least on the level of terminology, justification and the real presence of God in faith are in danger of being separated by the one-sidedly forensic doctrine of justification adopted by the FC and most of subsequent Lutheranism. In Luther's theology, however, both these motifs are completely united in the person of Christ. Christ is both the favor and… ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001CHJ5PG&location=212))
