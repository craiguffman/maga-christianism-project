### Highlights

- Natural theology attempts to build up some kind of knowledge of God (admittedly less than that which is had in revelation) from a consideration of the nature of this world and an understanding of our nature as experiencers of the knowledge of God. The essence of Barth’s complaint is that this is an attempt to achieve the knowledge of God apart from an encounter with the reality of God in action.15 The analogia entis suffers this failing as well. If God can be known by analogy from the nature of being itself, which we as human beings share, then God can be known apart from his acts. But if so, then God can be known apart from our interaction with him, the object of our knowledge. Unless, of course, being is understood as action, in which case the analogia entis would be subordinated to a knowledge of God’s being in action, and then we would have the knowledge of God only in interaction with him.16 The reality of God in revelation rejects and criticizes any attempt to build up knowledge of God from below. It is not possible to prescribe in advance what we may or may not find when we encounter God in revelation, nor even how we may know God in that encounter.

- The attempt to know God apart from God’s acts seems to Barth as misguided as the attempt to impose Aristotelian metaphysics upon the science of physics seemed to the scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. God remains hidden even when God reveals God’s self, because revelation is the revelation of the God who veils himself when he unveils himself.17 We know God only in the moment of gracious interaction with us (in the sense of moment of action, as in physics, rather than moment of time). This attitude Barth shares with critical realism, especially in the sciences, where history has proven that, although metaphysical commitments may be an element of any theory that can possibly be formed, they cannot be permitted to bind in advance what we may discover the world to be.

- Barth would, in strictly Kantian terms, be willing to grant human beings the mastery, the right to impose theoretical structures, in their knowledge of the world because they share being with the world and their theoretical structures are the objectification of their epistemological subjectivity.18 The philosophy of science is critically realistic about the knowledge of science because the world is truly other and human beings are not the master of the knowing relation, as demonstrated in the history of science. But many philosophers of science would be willing to grant human beings the mastery, the right to choose and impose theological structures upon the knowledge of God. They judge that human beings share being with God as God is primarily the objectification of their… ([Location 3673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008HSHKD2&location=3673))
- Barth insists that the revelation of God is not and never does become the revealedness of God. If, therefore, we are serious about the fact that this miracle is an event, we cannot regard the presence of God’s Word in the Bible as an attribute inhering once and for all in this book as such . . . We recollect, in and with the Church, that the Word of God has been heard in this book and in all parts of it . . . Yet the presence of the Word of God itself, the real and present speaking and hearing of it, is not identical with the existence of the book as such. But in this presence something takes place in and with… ([Location 3681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008HSHKD2&location=3681))
- It is the Holy Spirit who is the revealedness of God, not the doctrine of Holy Scripture, nor the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,… ([Location 3688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008HSHKD2&location=3688))
