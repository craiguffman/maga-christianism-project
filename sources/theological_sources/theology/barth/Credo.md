### Highlights

- The dissatisfaction with “natural theology,” the centrality of Christology, the sheer “givenness” of the gift of grace to the undeserving, the recognition that we cannot really see the enormity of sin until we have been captured by the vastness of grace, the Christian life as the life of gratitude in response to the greatness of what God has done, the glad certainty that in Christ sin and death have truly been conquered and that a new situation is therefore always before ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YP3WXMP&location=50))
- That there is particular urgency behind these lectures is made clear by the date. They were given when the shadow of Hitler had already fallen across Europe. Evil days were ahead. Right conviction was important as a basis for right action, and Barth felt, properly, that wrong conviction could lead to wrong action. Then as now, reflection upon an historic utterance of the faith was not an evasion of the present, but a means of arming one’s self to live responsibly in the present.

- Like the corresponding Greek πιστεύω, Credo at the head of the symbol means first of all quite simply the act of recognition—in the shape of definite cognitions won from Goďs revelation—of the reality of God in its bearing upon man.

- Faith therefore is a decision—the exclusion of unbelief in, the overcoming of opposition to, this reality, the affirmation of its existence and validity. Man believes. And therefore: man makes this decision, credo. But what gives faith its seriousness and power is not that man makes a decision, nor even the way in which he makes it, his feelings, the movement of his will, the existential emotion generated. On the contrary, faith lives by its object. It lives by the call to which it responds. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YP3WXMP&location=152))
- In believing, man obeys by his decision the decision of God. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YP3WXMP&location=160))
- The act of the Credo is the act of confession. But the subject of confession is the Church and therefore not the individual as such nor in virtue of any human or even divine mark of individuality, but the individual solely in virtue of his bearing the mark of membership of the Church. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YP3WXMP&location=172))
- When the individual says in the sense of the symbol, credo, he does not do that as an individual, but he confesses, and that means—he includes himself in the public and responsible recognition made by the Church.
