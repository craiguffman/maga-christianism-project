### Highlights

- A perfect example of this is Matthew’s love of referring to the Hebrew Scriptures. This or that episode in the story should call to mind for us this or that text from the Scriptures. All along the way, those around Jesus should have been able to pick up what the story was really about in the light of these connections. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=516))
- If only we had known how to read it: the pathos of Matthew’s Gospel lies in this. The cues and the clues are given, but those who know them do not respond. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=526))
- Matthew, as scholars like to remind us, is a theologian of God’s Wisdom - wisdom in the sense defined by those passages in the Old Testament and the Apocrypha, in Proverbs and Job, Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon that celebrate creation as a reflection of and a sharing in the joyful order and coherence of the mind of God. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=535))
- Those who are adopted into the family and fellowship of God’s Wisdom will be able to see the coherence of the world, to see how the bizarre and the incongruous may yet be God’s self-communication. What about those who continue to make themselves strangers to Wisdom, however? ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=539))
- the passages most clearly identifying Jesus with Wisdom itself, especially in this highly significant eleventh chapter of the Gospel, are precisely those that stress the inclusiveness of Jesus’ work. Due to the full presence of divine Sophia (Wisdom) in Jesus, ‘membership within a patriarchal family is dramatically replaced by membership within the family of disciples gathered around Wisdom ... and the metaphors used for this discipleship are inclusive - brother and sister and mother (12:46-50)’.9 Refusal of Wisdom is a refusal of this inclusive vision; refusal of Wisdom is going to be, ultimately, an act of violence against what seems incongruous and discontinuous - even though it is in truth the hidden logic, the hidden unity, of the world. ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=541))
- It is centred upon the belief that the identity of Jesus is what finally gives coherence to the history of God’s dealings with his, people - i.e. that he is Wisdom. It also prepares us gradually for a rejection of that Wisdom, which will show itself as a climactic moment of exclusion, an exclusion which will also be a self--destruction. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=550))
- The High Priest is using words drawn from the history of his people. Does he know, Jesus asks, what those words might actually mean? It is almost as if Jesus says, ‘It’s for you to tell me whether I am what you think I claim to be. The world in which these words about God’s anointed make sense is your world.’ ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=558))
- But the extra edge in Matthew is the turning of the question back upon the questioner. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=562))
- Jesus’ answer to the High Priest at his trial has a twofold force: you know how to look at the world, you already have the categories to make sense of it; but you use these categories as if you had no understanding of what they might truly mean. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=566))
- What do words like ‘God’ and ‘anointed’ mean in the mouth of the High Priest, presiding at such a tribunal? If he knew what he was saying, would he not either fall silent at once or realize the answer to his question? Jesus’ question is this: ‘Do you know yourself, your history? Do you really inhabit the words and the forms you use so fluently?’ ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=569))
- The High Priest’s question, rooted as it is in his people’s story, shows how the story has become dead in his mouth, ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=574))
- The power represented by Caiaphas, in its urgent anxiety to exclude and destroy Jesus, has become a power that excludes Wisdom itself. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=575))
- In terms of the reading of the answer to Caiaphas proposed above, the only possible sense that can be given to the words, ‘His blood be on us,’ is that it is an implicit admission by the managers of religious power that their exclusion of Jesus is a refusal of their own life and wholeness. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=590))
- what we think we are sure of, the language we speak so familiarly, is at odds with the truth. If we were to encounter directly what we talk about so freely, we should be terrified, angry and murderous. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=599))
- the few moments when she is vulnerable to the truth, when she cannot deny the complexity of her feelings and her knowledge, at some fairly well-buried level, that she is working consistently against God. They may be moments instantly overridden and denied, but they have not become impossible. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=611))
- she speaks to the fear that any moderately sensitive believer will experience with more or less regularity. What if I became incapable of telling truth from falsehood? What if the maintenance of my religious identity became a weapon against God? ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=614))
- a Greek village preparing for a passion play. Inexorably, the Gospel events begin to play themselves out in the lives of the actors, especially when the village is challenged to welcome an influx of refugees. When Manolios, who is to play Christ in the drama, takes the side of the refugees, the powers that be in the village have him killed, with the parish priest taking a leading role in the plot. Somehow, however, this dramatizes the Gospel conflict in excessively colourful terms. Christabel and Malle come closer to the experience of most of us, for whom the decisions are not, in the Kazantzakis style, issues… ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=617))
- The truth is that we do not know in advance how we might react, which in turn suggests that we are never in a position to identify those ‘others’ who are responsible for the killing of Christ so as to point a condemning finger. Matthew’s narrative does not allow the believer - in particular the articulate and educated believer, the teacher, the expert - any fixed answer to the question of how I might know that I am still with Jesus rather than with Caiaphas. As soon as… ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=624))
- In the presence of Jesus at his trial, faith unavoidably takes on something of a catch-22 dimension. What matters is to… ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=628))
- There is no escape, however, from the summons to be in the presence of Christ on trial. It is as if he said to each believer, ‘Stand where I can see you,’ and my faithfulness to him is going to be bound up with the whole diverse process of keeping myself ‘in question’. This is not a matter of obsessional self-scrutiny, the search for an impossible transparency to my ‘real’ motives or desires. It is only a sober and consistent recognition that I have no final and satisfying account to give of myself, and must wait in Christ’s presence to learn who I am. I must wait without the expectation of… ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=631))
- nor is it whether or not the formulations of faith can lead to arrogance, exclusivism and self-satisfaction (obviously they can and do). It is more to do with what we expect the language of Christian doctrine to do, and in the light of what we have been thinking about here, the answer… ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=639))
- The problem lies in the speakers. There is not enough depth in us for the words to emerge as credible; they have become external to us, tokens we use while forgetting what profound and frightening differences in the human world they actually refer to. If the point of traditional doctrinal forms is to hold us still, it is also, we could say, to create a depth in us, a space for radical change in how we think of ourselves and how we act. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=651))
- If the symbol of the crucified does not make this sort of recognition (and this sort of being recognized) possible, it has become an empty sign. If it becomes simply a pious way of giving meaning to my own suffering; if it becomes a symbol of human pain in the abstract; if it draws attention because it speaks to our fascination with pain, it is no longer in any useful sense the cross of Jesus. If it becomes the badge of a group causing or colluding with the suffering of others, it is no longer the cross of Jesus. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=707))
- Wisdom is the most fundamental reality in creation and in the history of God’s people, and yet it is the hardest of all things to recognize. When it is recognized, healing becomes possible for the world’s blind injustice and violence. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=724))
- If we follow through the logic of the trial, we may see that recognizing Wisdom in the dress of a beggar - quite literally, as Matthew 25 reminds us, recognizing Wisdom’s summons in the specific needs of the powerless - requires us to become familiar with some kinds of dispossession, some kind of letting go. The Wisdom that lives in the life of Jesus is Wisdom exposed to the pain and insecurity of human life in the world; to live in and by this Wisdom means a willingness to endure with Jesus and to follow his self-emptying in whatever way we can. In the particular context of the trial in Matthew, it means letting go of whatever it is that allows us to use the language of faith as a defence or a weapon. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=727))
- Such Wisdom will always be an exile, a refugee, in a world constrained by endless struggles for advantage, where success lies always in establishing your position at the expense of another’s. The first step in acquiring God’s Wisdom is therefore to search for what one recent writer has called ‘the intelligence of the victim’18- not because it is good or holy in itself to be a victim, far from it, but because looking at the world from the point of view of those excluded by its systems of power frees us from the need always to be securing our own power at all costs. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=746))
- The victim is the person left over or left out after a system has done its job, and is therefore an abiding challenge to the claim of any system to give a comprehensive solution to human needs and problems. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=750))
- We use the language of God’s unconditional love, of God’s action submitting itself to be worked out in the history of weak and sinful people, of God’s Wisdom made flesh in the pain and failure of Jesus’ death. ‘The words are your own,’ says Jesus. If you mean them, where do you stand? ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0027G6X5G&location=753))
