### Highlights

- The key characteristic of this phenomenon was voluntarism. Instead of waiting for a signal from an official church, individual Christians, often across denominational affiliations, joined such societies to commit themselves to the task of world mission. Lay people as well as clergy were involved in these associations, which were based on mass membership, and felt responsible for and generously supported them.

- It is noteworthy that this new model was initially shaped by pragmatic, not theological, reasoning. In order to "use means" to effectively accomplish the missionary goal, Carey looked outside the ecclesiastical structures available at that time and drew upon an analogy from commerce: organizing a volunteer "instrumentalist" society is like floating a company.
