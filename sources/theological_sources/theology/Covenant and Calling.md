- If the Christian Church has anything to say to the world at all, it must be grounded in what it has learned of God through Jesus Christ; and what it knows of Jesus Christ it knows in the first place by attending to the witness of the apostles who proclaimed him and the prophets who foretold him. Subsequent church tradition – in the form of the canons, creeds and councils of official teaching, or in the writings of theologians, ecclesiastical, learned or lay – gains its authority to the extent that it is able to be illuminated by, and therefore in response to shed light on, that primary witness and the one to whom it points. And this cannot but make central the work of seeking to understand Scripture. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=99))

- For the Church now, the question is not merely an antiquarian enterprise of uncovering the meanings of ancient texts, but rather the properly theological venture of discerning their meaning for us in our world. As Karl Barth declared, Christian theology as such ‘does not ask what the apostles and prophets said but what we must say on the basis of the apostles and prophets’.

- We cannot assume that faithfulness consists in the bald repetition of what has been said in the past; to say the same word in a different context is to say a different word. Revelation is properly speaking an event in which the living God speaks, not a deposit which we can regard as safely tied up because we hold to a high view of biblical authority or because we proclaim our faithfulness to the received tradition. We are not in a position to control how God may choose to speak, and our incompetence in this is not eased by efforts to lay down a hermeneutical method in advance, or to parade our agreement with previous generations of church teachers. Rather our responsibility is always one of exercising judgement, learning how we are to think and act now, in the knowledge that our thinking and acting are finally made right not because of the correctness of our judgements, but because we ourselves live under the mercy of God’s judgement.

- But even if rights-talk is something that Christian theology may properly wish to endorse in particular circumstances, there is also a strong case for thinking that it should not be its primary moral language. It too easily suggests a vision of society as constituted by self-sufficient individuals who contract to enter into social relationships only when it suits their interests, and who fail to recognize that from before the day they are born they are embedded in a network of relationships which sustain them and which in turn they are called to sustain. Of itself it has too impoverished an understanding of human beings to provide an adequate rendering of the Christian moral vision. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=124))
- In one way or another, many theological defences of same-sex relationships seek to play down the created nature of bodies and bodily difference, and as a result they arguably run the danger of being incipiently ‘docetic’ in nature. The ancient heresy of docetism centred on the claim that the earthly body of Jesus was apparent rather than real. Such an idea may have proved attractive to some of those who wanted to secure the truth that God transcends the material creation that is subject to change and decay, but it was rejected from very early on, on the grounds that it suggested the denial of the goodness of creation and of the salvation of human beings through Christ’s redemptive identification with their bodily nature. ‘By this you know the Spirit of God,’ the first epistle of John declares, ‘every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God’ (1 John 4.2). In terms of theological anthropology, this obliges us to question any understanding of human beings that in effect portrays the flesh as the external and contingent clothing of the ‘real me’, and sees the true self as fleshless spirit.

- However, when it is asserted or implied that one’s sex is immaterial, or that there is in principle no connection at all in creation between sex and procreation, we might begin to wonder whether we are beginning to witness the denial of our nature as body–soul unities. We may regard bodies as good, but our thought may still be tacitly dualistic; and as the Protestant ethicist Paul Ramsey observed, modern ‘good-body’ dualism is just as dualistic as ancient ‘bad-body’ dualism.2 It is not enough to say that by contrast with ancient dualisms sex is regarded as a good in such modern accounts, and therefore that matter matters. An emphasis on relationality which sees one’s sex as indifferent disregards the sexed nature of bodies that is in some sense given with creation – even if, as we shall see, the precise nature of this needs to be carefully thought through. If we are going to endorse same-sex relations in some way, we have to seek to do so in terms that do not evidently deny what the Christian tradition has wished to affirm about the goodness of creation and the humanity of Christ.

- If we are to find a theological account of faithful and permanent same-sex relationships, it will need to be by a different route and cannot proceed by hurriedly eliding the question of procreation. ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=606))
- For procreation is a good of creation that gains its final intelligibility from its being a participation by created beings, in a manner appropriate to created beings, in the original gift of creation itself. And just as creation has now been fulfilled in Christ, so the purpose of procreation has now been fulfilled. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=619))
- How would covenant partnerships be characterized? Like marriages, they also would be marked by three goods. First, those entering upon them would be committed to faithfulness. Just as Christ gave himself up for the Church, so also the partners would commit themselves not only negatively to excluding sexual relationships with all others, but would each be actively committed to giving themselves up for and nurturing the other in love. Second, they would embody a commitment to permanence. Just as God, despite his anger at Israel’s unfaithfulness, repeatedly commits himself to them, so covenant partnerships would be constituted and sustained by mutual commitments of the partners to each other until death did them part. Third, instead of biological procreativity, they would be characterized by other forms of fruitfulness. Since such relationships are eschatologically grounded, they would take their orientation from the demands of the Kingdom. In line with Paul’s aspirations in 1 Corinthians 7, they would be freed to be anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; they could not be self-enclosed or self-satisfied, but would be open to the call of charity beyond themselves. Echoing in the new eschatological context God’s original declaration about Adam that it is not good for human beings to be alone, their relationship would enable each to be a helper to the other, making possible a degree of fruitfulness in the service of the Kingdom that might not have been possible for them as individuals separately. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=627))
- That covenant partnerships are not inherently procreative does not mean that they would never involve the raising of children, only that children would not be a result of the couple’s sexual relationship. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=787))
- As a matter of brute historical fact, the Christian tradition has known of no other kind of marriage than that between a man and a woman, and for some that is sufficient to close the case: marriage, they conclude, must be between spouses of opposing sexes, and there is no further discussion to be ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=801))
- Equally if it turns out, as I will argue is the case, that the reasons for thinking that marriage should be sexually differentiated are reasons that apply only to marriage, then covenant partnerships would be freed to be either heterosexual or homosexual. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=809))
- The Christian tradition offers broadly three basic kinds of reason for thinking that marriage should be sexually differentiated.1 The first reason is that marriage embodies a hierarchical relationship between the sexes. If one believes that male and female are related as superordinate to subordinate, and if one also assumes that a relationship between two superordinates or between two subordinates will lack the rightly ordered structure that a marriage properly needs, then one has the groundwork for an argument that marriages should be heterosexual. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=810))

- But these observations only marginally diminish the overwhelming sense that we are offered here an androcentric perspective. And in general throughout both Testaments texts come readily to hand that appear to take for granted and actively to teach that men and women are to be placed in an unequal, hierarchical relationship both in marriage and in social relationships more generally. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=819))

- What must be affirmed instead is that mutual subordination must be located within a framework characterized by a basic equality and cannot be the grounding for that basic equality. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=842))

- For if one accepts as a legitimate reading of the overall biblical witness – despite some apparently plain biblical emphases to the contrary – that men and women are equal in Christ, and that it is proper for this to be reflected in gender relations now, then it follows that there is a case for rejecting gender subordination in marriage, and therefore that hierarchical order cannot be used as a conclusive argument for sexual differentiation in marriage. If both parties are to be regarded as ontologically equal, then the argument from hierarchy offers no grounds for rejecting same-sex marriage, since two partners of the same sex are by definition ontologically equal. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=853))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- This brings us to a second kind of reason for thinking that marriage must be sexually differentiated, namely that it embodies an intrinsic complementarity that is not hierarchical, at least in principle. We should note that this last phrase does a lot of work, since it has been one of the central burdens of critical gender theory that binary oppositions always in practice privilege one of their elements: the logic of identity in Western thought ensures that in dichotomies such as mind/body, nature/culture, human/animal, subject/object, the identity of the first in each pair is secured by expelling or somehow problematizing the second. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=858))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- My point will not be that putatively complementary, equal-but-different relationships can always be shown to be unequal in practice, but that even if non-hierarchical complementarity is indeed possible, the reasons for endorsing it would not be sufficient to reject same-sex relationships. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=864))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- The third argument for the necessary complementarity of marriage is purely theological in nature. On the basis of humankind being made in the image of God, Karl Barth maintains that the male–female encounter is intrinsic to all forms of human relating, including marriage. The triune God, he argues, is internally relational, and so creatures made in God’s image must also be intrinsically beings-in-relation. But for human beings the element of sexual differentiation within this relationality is inescapable; the first time we meet human beings in Genesis, it is as male and female, and it is as male and female that they are made in the image of God. But Barth refuses to ground sexual differentiation in any general, specifiable feature of men and women: it is in the pure fact of encounter between them that they image God, however this is embodied, and not in any specific attribute such as a joint capacity for procreation, or differentiated gender roles, or psychological or other dissimilarities. It is not these differences but the male–female relationship as such which constitutes humanity fundamentally as humanity in relationship, since the difference of male and female is the primordial differentiation between human beings that is at the same time the ‘one long reference to the relationship’ between them.2 Marriage constitutes one long reference to the relationship, and must inevitably be heterosexual. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=885))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- It is surely for these kinds of reason that Barth refused to be drawn on any specifics about what the difference between male and female might consist in. The fact of encounter, not its particular empirical correlates, is what matters. However, it is not clear that his case for the necessary sexual differentiation of marriage fares any better. For once one has denied any specific grounding of difference (procreative capacity, psychological differences, or whatever), then one has lost any reason for thinking sexual differentiation is morally significant beyond the fact that it is ‘commanded’. If it is the fact of encounter that is significant, why should that solely be between male and female? If it is the ‘one long reference to relationship’, that can only be because marriage must be for life; but then why should that marriage be of an opposite-sex couple? Ultimately, the only difference Barth can point to is that of a certain ‘precedence’ on the part of the man and ‘subsequence’ on the part of the woman. But this suggests that the distinction can only be sustained by recourse to the hierarchical version of complementarity I referred to earlier, which in turns fuels the suspicions of those who were never inclined to be sympathetic towards complementarian schemes in the first place. Although the overall structure of Barth’s theology of the sexes is arguably more egalitarian in initial inspiration, which is why I discuss it here rather than as a form of hierarchical complementarity, it seems in the end unable to hide its secret inequality-in-difference. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=920))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Perhaps even more decisive than these points is that Barth surely misinterprets the actual ground given in Genesis 1 for sexual differentiation, namely the role that it plays in procreation. And this leads us on to the third kind of argument given in the Christian tradition for sexual differentiation in marriage, namely that marriage in creation is intrinsically procreative. As we saw in Chapter 1, the significance of being created male and female in Genesis 1 is not that humankind thereby images the inner relationality of God, but that sexual differentiation is the necessary basis for human beings to procreate. To be in the image of God is to have a mandate to rule on God’s behalf, and that rule is enabled by having children: by being fruitful and multiplying, humankind is thereby able to fill the earth, subdue it and have stewardship of the other creatures. In other words, the reason for there being two sexes is that this is the way the human species reproduces. Children might in the divine providence have come to be by means other than sex: they could have been produced by some asexual self-propagation of a single-sex species. But in the world with which we have to do they come to be as the fruit of a couple’s relationship; and that is not just adventitious, as if the parents’ one-flesh union were one thing and the child’s coming to be something entirely other. Rather for a couple to experience the miracle of procreation as a fruit of their mutual love is also for them to come to know something of the miracle of creation itself as the free outpouring of the divine love. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=931))
- Sexual differentiation is therefore justified within marriage, but it is only justified because marriage in creation is oriented to procreation. There are no other grounds that can provide the theological weight needed to require that marriage be sexually differentiated. However, this also implies that if procreation is no longer eschatologically necessary, then there are no grounds for requiring all committed relationships to be heterosexual. If there is a theological case for eschatologically grounded covenant partnerships which are inherently non-procreative, there is no reason why they should be heterosexual. Indeed Augustine recognized the logic of the position. He accepted that there would be two sexes in heaven, but struggled to understand what rationale sexual differentiation would continue to have, speculating that through appreciation of the beauty of the other sex we would be moved to praise God the more. And we may find the beginnings of such a recognition in the writings of Paul himself. In his celebrated formula in Galatians 3.28, he strikingly writes that in Christ ‘there is no longer Jew or Greek . . . no longer slave or free . . . no longer male and female’: where we might have expected the parallel ‘male or female’, he appears instead deliberately to echo Genesis 1.27 (‘male and female he created them’). Baptism and the new identity in Christ take us beyond the creation categories of male and female in a way that renders them no longer of defining importance. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=950))
- But it also underlines a central implication that emerges out of the idea of covenant partnerships. If they are defined as non-procreative, and if sexual differentiation is unnecessary for them, they are open to all: whatever one’s place on the spectrum of sexual differentiation, whatever one’s gender identity, whatever one’s sexual orientation, whatever one’s capacity or lack of capacity for procreation, the fundamental question is of calling to covenant partnership. The issue is not one’s physiology or the direction of one’s desires, but the willingness to commit to a particular person, with a view to faithfulness, permanence, and fruitfulness. Finding oneself in Christ does not mean the dissolution of all other identities, but rather submitting them to Christ and being open to the calling to witness to God’s covenant faithfulness, in the sanctifying reality of a particular relationship. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=964))
- If none of the arguments for the necessity of sexual differentiation work, we can look to a picture of the Church in which different people have different callings. Some are called to marriage that is open to procreation to show forth God’s continuing commitment to his creation. Some are called to celibacy to point forward to the time when God will be all in all. And some are called to non-procreative covenant relationships to witness to the time between the times, when God’s purposes for creation have been fulfilled in Christ… ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=970))

- As I present it, the shape of the question is not in the first place about sex, but about relationships. That is, the first question we should ask is not about who you may have sex with and when, or about how far you can go, but about what kinds of relationships we should be committed to. Sex does not exist as a free-floating entity independent of relationship, but gains its meaning from the relationship to which it belongs and which forms its context. An ethics of sex therefore does not start off from reflections on the nature of sex, but from thinking about relationship: the questions of who one is committed to and what the meaning of that commitment is form the setting against which to think about what one may do within that relationship.

- However, there are also good reasons for taking care about turning to the language of friendship. In the modern West, friendship suggests a less well-defined relationship than permanent commitment. There are no clearly marked distinctions between being a friend, on the one hand, and being merely an acquaintance or a colleague or someone who hangs around in the same social group, on the other. Friendship ordinarily connotes a non-sexual relationship: when we say that two people are ‘just friends’, we imply that their relationship is non-romantic and non-erotic. Faithful may be the wounds of a friend, but friendships also come and go. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=1011))

- By contrast, a formally celebrated and publicly recognized undertaking of marriage or covenant partnership indicates entry into a set of commitments that is different in kind and brings with it definable and perhaps legally enforceable rights and obligations. Of course in marriages or covenant partnerships the partners may well be the best of friends, and it is wonderful when they are; and of course in a formal sense marriages and covenant partnerships are both species of friendship in the more generic sense. But they remain categorically different from friendships ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00NU37I3Q&location=1017))

- Yet even if marriage is unavoidably linked to procreation, does it follow that sex is also unavoidably linked to procreation? If it does follow, it would imply that every time a married couple has sex, they must be open to the possibility of having children. Even if sex additionally and simultaneously has other roles in a couple’s relationship, it would always have to have that procreative possibility.

- It remains the Roman Catholic Church’s official teaching that artificial contraceptive techniques are intrinsically wrong: ‘each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life’, declared Humanae Vitae, Paul VI’s 1968 encyclical which reaffirmed the traditional Catholic teaching. This doctrine, the encyclical continued, ‘is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act’ (Humanae Vitae, para. 12). Married love tends of itself to be fruitful, and the unitive significance of sex (its tendency to foster the partners’ love for each other) cannot be separated from its procreative significance.

    - **Tags:** #orange
- Much more intriguing and substantial is the argument offered by Pope John Paul II, both when he was Pope and previously as Karol Wojtyla.5 His fundamental concern is not that contraception deprives sex of its biological potential, but that it deprives sex of its personal meaning. Human nature is indeed integrated in the person and not just in the biological body. This means that the physical act cannot be separated from the person. But it equally also means that the person cannot be separated from the physical act: if sex is truly to be an act of personal communion, he maintains, it cannot just consist in the disembodied relationality of two lovers, but must involve the total self-giving of each of the partners, including the gift by each of their capacity for fertility. Contraception denies that self-gift and refuses the self-gift of the other by refusing their gift of fertility. It is therefore a denial of love, which involves the giving of the whole self and not just one dimension of the self; love, one might say, is inherently procreative. John Paul II is very clear that love here is intended in an objective sense: subjectively, in terms of the felt emotions of the couple, contracepted sex can be very loving, but objectively it should in fact be seen as a denial of love. In this respect he goes beyond earlier teachings, which maintained that the unitive and procreative ends of sex should not be separated, but which nevertheless allowed that contracepted sex could be loving in an objective sense and therefore could at least embody the unitive end; for him, the unitive end of embodying and fostering the couple’s love is fundamentally violated and denied by contraception – the marital act in such circumstances is not a personal union, but becomes a mere ‘sexual association’.

- The Roman Catholic discussion has of course been much more ramified and complex than is evident from these comments. But if we return to the question that gave rise to it, the point remains: however one reaches the conclusion, if one concedes that contraception is justifiable, one also concedes that sex is characterized by a good which is independent of and additional to its orientation to procreation.

- What opens the path to affirming sexual same-sex relationships is rather, first, determining what kinds of relationships we are called to be committed to, whether marriage alone or, as I have argued, also eschatologically grounded covenant partnerships that are not procreative in nature; and then establishing the claim that there is no necessary complementarity between the sexes other than that of procreation; and then putting those arguments together, the conclusion that covenant partnerships may be same-sex in nature.

- To then accept that contraception is in principle legitimate is to admit that sex may have, intrinsically and objectively and not just in the choices or willings of the partners, a different and separable meaning from procreativity.

- So far I have talked about marriage and covenant partnership as two separate vocations, the one grounded in creation and inseparable from procreation, the other grounded eschatologically and non-procreative in nature. The latter, let me say by way of reminder, could be heterosexual or homosexual. Moreover, covenant partnerships could be accompanied by children, which ex hypothesi could not be the fruit of their own sexual union, though they might be the result of adoption or fostering, or might be biologically related to just one of the couple for some other reason, for example that they were from a previous relationship.

- In so far as this is an argument for covenant partnership, it is an argument for a new theological category, that is, a way for giving theological definition and intelligibility to certain kinds of relationships. This reflects a theme in much contemporary Christian ethics that the Church has to learn its own language first before it turns to address the world. If it fails to be shaped by its own story, it will inevitably be shaped by the stories of the world around it. If it is shaped by the stories of the world around it, it will in the end forget the one whose story it is called to tell.

- This would have the advantage of ease, and no doubt for church managers this would make it the most attractive option. But it would also face severe problems. It would lend itself too easily to the denial of the significance of sexual difference, with consequences not only for our understanding of ourselves as occupying a place on the spectrum of sexual differentiation, but also for our understanding of sexual relations: sex would easily become whatever we choose to make it mean, its procreative capacity becoming a contingent feature of it.

- It might acquiesce in the basic redefinition of marriage implied by the notion of equal marriage, but at considerable theological loss. And finally, because covenant partnership would have no visible place in the Church’s ministry, it might close the door on the notion of covenant partnership showing us anything different about the possibilities for human relationship; by locking them all up under the category of marriage, it would inevitably act as a force for normalisation and conventionality. Same-sex marriage on the liberal egalitarian model, whereby all difference is erased, might end up ironically being the most conservative of options, and the particular gifts that lesbians, gays, transsexuals and intersex people, as well as heterosexual couples wishing to explore forms of non-procreative vocation, might bring to the Church and to wider society would be suffocated in a smog of conformity.

- There are many attractions to this approach. It would give a unified theological account of marriage and covenant partnership, bringing out the subterranean connections between the two, and also showing how a creation ordinance is taken up and fulfilled eschatologically without losing its grounding in creation. It would make clear that marriages are always between equals: same-sex covenant partnerships cannot be understood as unions hierarchically ordered by gender and so the claim that marriage itself would necessarily be between equals would be fundamentally confirmed. It would revivify the Christian understanding that marriages are always for something beyond themselves, not just for the personal fulfilment of the couple.
