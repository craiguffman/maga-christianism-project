### Highlights

- The rediscovery of Aristotle allowed Latin Christianity to renew and vastly expand its appropriation of the Greek philosophical heritage, which found remote warrant in Augustine's (354-430) classic work on education and biblical exegesis, On Christian Doctrine (De doctrina christiana), and built on the proximate foundation laid by twelfth-century schools, especially Hugh of St. Victor's (ro96-I 141) plan for the reform of education, the Didascalicon. In his influential text, Augustine authorized Christians to take from the philosophers whatever they found true and to make it their own, as the Israelites had despoiled the Egyptians in the Exodus at the command of God. After centuries of interruption, this despoiling, or Christianization, of "the intellectual deposit of the Greco-Roman past" began anew, in the late eleventh-century school of Anselm of Laon (d. 1117), and continued in subsequent generations in the schools of Paris.2 But Augustine's warrant was limited: The Christian was only to pursue secular subjects to the extent that they contributed to an understanding of scripture.' Hugh expanded the warrant: The Christian was to pursue all subjects as a means to restoring the knowledge lost in the Fall. 4 All the arts and sciences are paths to Gods ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=122))
- The thirteenth-century appropriation of the Aristotelian corpus (and of the Neoplatonic texts that were believed to be a part of this corpus) built on the work of the twelfth-century "renascence" and brought to fruition a new, scientific, and systematicmethod for practicing philosophy and theology. This scientific method consisted of a dialectical analysis of discordant views through rigorous questioning and examination. Indeed, these new doctrines, examined under this novel method, led to the birth of a new school-Scholasticism. As it has recently been put, Scholasticism's aim was "nothing less than to embrace all knowledge and every kind of activity in a single world-view. "6 The Scholastics found Aristotle to be a kindred spirit in this endeavor; his work constitutes a sort of encyclopedia of knowledge. What is more, the Scholastics found in Aristotle's work the great tool for their endeavor-logic ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=129))
- The second great movement that Bonaventure encountered in Paris was the recent turn to "universities" for education. For much of the Middle Ages, formal education had primarily taken place in the monastery or in the cathedral school. In fact, the cathedral school at Paris was well known for some of its distinguished teachers, such as William of Cham- peaux (ca. 1070-1122) and Peter Abelard (I079-I142). In 1200, disputes between students and civil authorities precipitated a crisis. Philip II responded by exempting the masters and students from civil jurisdiction: He granted this community of scholars a charter with special privileges that placed them under the authority of the bishop of Paris and his designated chancellor.' This act marks the formation of a semiautonomous corporate body with its own organization and governance, a sort of guild, like the art guilds of the day. "Universitas" was the word applied to this body, a word used for any body or association that had an independent juridical status. Another university developed at almost the same time across the English Channel at Oxford, and yet another was to follow not long afterward at Cambridge.… ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=135))
- The Franciscans were part of a larger group of new religious orders that lived in poverty and survived on alms. These "mendicant" orders had an enormous impact on the life of the church, but it was the Friars Minor (as the Franciscans were called to distinguish them from the other mendicant orders, also known as friars)10 who left an indelible imprint on Catholic Christianity that endures to this day and is felt at every level of… ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=151))
- Lateran IV set down a vast renewal program for the whole Christian life. Among its more important provisions, it mandated that every Catholic receive communion and go to confession at least once a year: "All the faithful of either sex, after they have reached the age of discernment, should individually confess all their sins in a faithful manner to their own priest at least once a year, and let them take care to do what they can to perform penance imposed on them. Let them reverently receive the sacrament of the eucharist at least at Easter." 16 The mendicant orders provided the papacy with the means of implementing this pastoral program by taking up two fundamental duties: preaching and hearing confessions. Both duties required education, as the council fathers had clearly realized in their renewed call… ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=164))
- Francis had been wary of learning and studies-in his seventh admonition, he warns about the danger of wanting knowledge for the sake of being thought wiser than others"'-but as the friars became more involved in the Lateran IV reforms, the necessity of acquiring at least a basic knowledge of the Bible and the church fathers became clear. Hence,… ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=170))
- The first lector and the first to teach theology in a friary was Anthony of Padua, a Portuguese and one-time Augustinian canon who joined the Franciscans.19 Anthony would not take up the task of teaching theology until he received Francis's permission. In giving it, however, Francis added… ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=172))
- He was, after all, minister general of the largest religious order of his day and a widely known doctor of theology who inspired a whole generation of Augustinians. Some specific dates in the life Bonaventure are known with certitude: the date of his election as general of the Franciscan order (1257) and the date of his death while attending the second Council of Lyons (1274). Although other exact dates are subject to dispute, the sequence of major events in Bonaventure's life is generally clear. Since a near-contemporary document tells us that he died at age fifty-three, and we know the year of his death, it has usually been thought that he was born in 1221.25… ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=187))
- At baptism, Bonaventure received his father's name, Giovanni; he apparently received the name "Bonaventure"… ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=210))
- Alexander has long been regarded as the font for what is commonly referred to as "the Augustinian school." It is commonly held that there were four high-medieval schools: Franciscan Augustinianism (divided into three currents), Christian Aristotelianism (Thomism), Averroistic Aristotelianism, and scientifico-physical… ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=224))
- In August 1257, Bonaventure and his colleague, Thomas Aquinas, formally took possession of their chairs in theology at the university. The question of Bonaventure's formal entrance into the university faculty wasa moot point by October of that year, however, because in February, a general chapter… ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=236))
- In his Disputed Questions, Bonaventure gently but unambiguously corrects the beloved founder's extreme, if not dangerously enthusiastic, claimsfor poverty. Bonaventure recontextualizes poverty in the whole Christian life. Poverty is carefully presented, not as an end in itself, but as a particularly effective means to insuring two essential Christian virtues: (i) the fundamental humility that every Christian should have before God, and (2) the charity that is the… ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=251))
- Peter the Lombard was born in Lombardy between 1095 and i ioo. He went to Paris for studies in 1136 and became a canon of Notre Dame in 1145. In 1159, he became bishop of Paris, an office he held for only a year, since he died in July i i6o.54 This twelfth-century ecclesiastic exercised considerable influence over Scholasticism, because he developed a textbook of theology that was to shape the way generations of theologians would approach various theological topics; indeed, it remained the standard textbook until Cajetan (1469-1534) began using Aquinas's Summa Theologiae, more than three centuries later." ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=291))
- Indeed, sentence collection and systematictheology developed so clearly hand in hand that they may be regarded as two sides of a single invention of the twelfth century.56 "The Sentences constitute the Lombardian summa that emerged out of the course of systematic theology that Peter taught for well-nigh two de- cades."57 ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=297))
- Another important theological text is Bonaventure's Breviloquium ("Brief Commentary"). This text is a small summa of theology that aims at treating briefly the whole range of topics in Christian theology. Bonaventure says that he composed it for the sake of fellow Franciscans with the purpose of reaffirming the centrality of the scriptures in the exposition of the faith. The Augustinian character of the Breviloquium is apparent. There is no theology apart from the enlightenment of the human mind, found in the infused virtue of faith reflecting on divine revelation in sacred scripture. Reason without faith will fall into error. The text is particularly important in terms of biblical hermeneutics or interpretation. It presents clearly and carefully the four levels of meaning found in a biblical text by most medieval believers. These levels are usually divided into the material, or literal, meaning and the three spiritual meanings: allegorical, anagogical, and tropological. This doctrine is discussed in more detail in the chapter on theology. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=304))
- In 1259, early in his generalate, Bonaventure withdrew to a mountain retreat called La Verna. On this rugged and heavily wooded mountain in the summer of 1224, Francis had received the stigmata, or marks from the wounds of the crucified Christ. After returning from his mountain retreat, Bonaventure composed his most famous work, Journey of the Mind to God (Itinerarium mentis in Deum). It is an explanation of how the mind can ascend to God through six steps from the contemplation of sensible things to God himself. It is a text that can be read for many differentpurposes. It is a theological work that draws extensively on metaphysics; indeed, its depth is really only revealed when read with an eye open to its metaphysical doctrines. Yet, at the same time, it is one of the most popular works in spiritual theology in the entire history of Christian thought. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=309))
- Bonaventure's approach to dealing with the Averroist crisis contrasts radically with Aquinas's. Whereas Aquinas tried to meet the crisis by rescuing Aristotle, that is, by trying to insure that Aristotle was correctly interpreted, Bonaventure argues that the problem lies much deeper: the Averroists' fundamental error was to use reason to judge the truths of the faith. While Aquinas attacks their interpretation of Aristotle, Bonaventure attacks their fundamental rationalism, which would subject the truths of the faith to the judgment of reason and the criticism of philosophy. In these conferences, Bonaventure finally presents his complete catalogue of errors attributable to Aristotle: (i) the denial of exemplarism (or the theory of forms in a transcendent cause, which Bonaventure explicitly associates with Plato); (2) denial of divine knowledge of world; (3) the necessity of all things (which flows from the second, according to Bonaventure, since if God does not know the world, all things happen either by chance or by absolute necessity; the former is impossible, so the latter must obtain); (4) the denial of eternal life where reward or punishmentis found; (5) the eternity of the world; and (6) the existence of a single intellect for all men (a view that Bonaventure is careful to say Averroes attributes to Aristotle).65 ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=336))
- His commentary on Ecclesiastes presents some of his most central and profound ideas. The world is a sign from God: "Every creature is the divine word, because it speaks of God."66 To love the world above God is to confuse the sign for its giver. Charity or true love involves recognizing the sign as a sign, and thereby turning one's love to the sign giver. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=344))
- The disputes within thirteenth-century Scholasticism first came to light thanks to the research in the 188os of Franz Ehrle.69 It eventually became customary to speak of various "schools" in the late medieval period, for example, the Thomist, the Franciscan, and the Scotist. Gilson contributed significantly to this tendency, because his work disclosed many of the differences among the Scholastics. However, some have criticized this discussion of schools for imposing greater self-consciousness and cohesion to thinkers who shared certain theses. At most, we should speak of certain theological or… ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=361))
- It is largely accurate to say that Bonaventure became the leading spokesman for the Augustinian tradition in the thirteenth century. Yet, the story is not so simple. Because his own relation to the thought of Aristotle is not simple, we have to avoid falling into an overly rigid… ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=377))
- Bonaventure took up the task of engaging Aristotle in the years immediately after 1250. He studied the philosopher's thought extensively and made considerable use of Aristotle's work in his own writings. He quotes Aristotle 1,015 times, from every one of the philosopher's works except the Politics, which was not yet translated.75 Bonaventure quotes De anima the most often (138 times), followed closely by the Physics (136 times). The Topics (134 times), Nicomachean Ethics (131), and Metaphysics (125) are next in order of frequency. He quotes from a work that was attributed to Aristotle, the Liber de Causis, forty-seven times. (Aquinas was the first to realize that this work is not Aristotle's.) Bonaventure incorporated certain key Aristotelian doctrines into his own thought. For example, he combines a considerable amount of Aristotle's cognitional theory with his own, such as a doctrine of the… ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=379))
- Theology is not a purely speculative science; it is also an eminently practical science, concerned with issues of life-and-death importance to the soul. Bonaventure takes a middle position on the question of whether theology is a speculative or practical science-it is a sapiential habit.2 Faith resides in the intellect, but its purpose is to move the affections. Contemplation and holiness are inseparable, but to make us good is theology's principal aim. Theology is a whole way of life and its goal is nothing less than union with God. It decides everything, for it is the queen of the sciences. The quest for wisdom may lead through all the arts and sciences, but eventually,… ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=399))
- It is important to note that Bonaventure does not deny that philosophy can attain truth without faith; rather, he says that the truths discovered by such an autonomous philosophy will be mixed with errors.24 It is important then to make a clear distinction between an autonomous philosophy and a heteronomous one; the latter looks to theology to restrain it from falling into positive error. Bonaventure regards philosophy as capable of achieving certitude using its own proper methods.Reason, however, also receives a positive contribution from the faith, which is essential for philosophy to be brought to completion. Faith allows one to understand what might not otherwise be understood. According to Bonaventure, the faith is an intrinsic principle to the philosopher that guides him to greater and greater understanding-it is not a merely extrinsic norm that prevents the philosopher from falling into error. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=485))
- The delicate balance between philosophy and theology that Bonaventure attempted to maintain is best portrayed in his short treatise now called On the Reduction of the Arts to Theology (De reductione artium ad theologiam). This text is among his most important; the "reduction" to which it refers is a "leading back" of all the arts and sciences to theology, and of all cognition to God. All knowledge leads up to the study of sacred scripture, the study of God's own revelation. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=492))
- The multiform wisdom of God is found above all in sacred scripture, but because wisdom "lies hidden in all knowledge and in all nature," all the disciplines can lead us to God.25 Granted, the height of wisdom is found in Christ; nevertheless, Christ, as the wisdom of God, is found hidden in all creation. In this sense, creation too is revelation. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=495))
- The second light that Bonaventure treats is the inferior light, which is of sense perception. It illumines with respect to natural forms. This light has five divisions corresponding to the five senses.Next, Bonaventure treats an interior light, the light of philosophical knowledge. It illumines with respect to intelligible truth. It has three divisions: rational, natural, and moral. The light of natural philosophy concerns the truth of things, and it enlightens the mind to discern the causes of being. It is further divided into metaphysics, physics, and mathematics. Finally, Bonaventure discusses the superior light, which is the light of grace and of sacred scripture. It illumines with respect to the saving truth. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=513))
    - **Note:** This is much like the distinction H makes wrt the scripture - it provides this revelation, but that is limited to saving truth.
- Gilson argues, however, that the thirteenth century provides us with two different understandings of Christian philosophy, and Bonaventure and Aquinas typify these two approaches. In Aquinas's thought, philosophy has a certain relative autonomy. While it has its own proper methods, it accepts the extrinsic control of the faith. As a result, philosophy is formally distinct from theology. In Bonaventure, however, philosophy is heteronomous (especially because it cannot avoid error without theology) and is strengthened by the intrinsic influence of the faith. On this point, we confront a striking difference between Bonaventure and his fellow Scholastics. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=547))
- In the first half of the thirteenth century, all the theologians were primarily influenced by the increasing number of texts from Aristotle. As a result, members of the theology faculty developed various forms of an eclectic Aristotelianism, or what one might call a Neoplatonizing Aristotelianism. But these developments were always in the context of a theological framework; as a result, they remained fundamentally Augustinian in spirit. The Augustinianism of the faculty was theological in character. They often paid scant attention to the formal distinction between philosophy and theology, and, as a result, frequently subordinated the former to the latter. Philosophy was merely an instrument serving the speculative method of theology. Their philosophy then remained eclectic; its unity was based on principles drawn from theological sources. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=562))
- It is the contention of this book that Bonaventure's thought presents us with genuine philosophy, whose content and spirit can be studied without entering formally into theology, in part, because he carefully distinguishes between arguments from reason and those from authority. This is not to say that Bonaventure would accept the rationalist thesis that the doctrines of the faith should be judged by reason. But according to Bonaventure, philosophy finds its completion in recognizing the likeness according to which creation has been made: the Verbum spoken from all eternity in the mind of God-Wisdom. According to Bonaventure, Wisdom is a person who calls us and beckons us to a journey of the mind to God.44 ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038YYAPG&location=576))
