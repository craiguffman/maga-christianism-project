### Highlights

- Sanctification must be equally emphasized, however, to prevent understanding Christ’s work in a way that separates it from the effect it has on the believer. This is what prevents the Christian life from being reduced to an intellectual adherence to certain beliefs. The Christian Gospel does more than provide a clarification of the human condition; it charges us to order that existence, including our own lives, in accordance with it. Put in more traditional terms, the justified Christian must be the Christian that produces good works. ([Location 3989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WRSNZGM&location=3989))

- My thesis is that the analysis of character which I have developed and the understanding of the self associated with it can provide a way of making intelligible some of the primary affirmations involved in the doctrine of sanctification without destroying its vital relationship to justification. In so doing I have no wish to remove the mystery of God’s justifying and sanctifying activity. I do not take the mystery to be the way we are formed as men graced by God, but rather that the God who is our creator wills to love even the disobedient men we are. In loving and sanctifying us, he does not act contrary to or above his creation, but through and in it—i.e., the sanctification of men does not happen apart from the way we as men form ourselves through our acts and deeds. To be sanctified is to have one’s character formed in a definite kind of way. What distinguishes Christian sanctification from the ways men’s lives are generally shaped and formed is not the process of formation itself but the basis and consequent shape of that formation.
