### Highlights

- The tree is fundamentally a both/and image. It is an organism of Deep Roots and Wild Branches. Rooted in God’s faithful activity in the past and growing wildly toward God’s promised future manifesting in the present. In a space of liminality, a threshold between times, Paul uses this very metaphor to describe the composite nature of the church (Rom. 11:17–24). As communal life in Jesus began to take on new forms among the Gentiles, Paul describes this transformation as grafting, “what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree” (Rom. 11:24). ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=97))
- In the world of revitalization, rewiring declining congregations to join the Spirit’s work of transforming communal ecosystems is called futurefitting. Let’s begin futurefitting your local church in the blended ecology way for life at the tree! ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=109))
- There were around thirty people in worship, the majority of whom were chronologically mature (precious saints more than eighty years old, sustaining the church with their blood, sweat, and tears). This ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=126))
- there are primarily three possible paths through which a church can experience revitalization: Re-Engineering: Looking at all the parts of a congregation’s life and seeking to re-strategize, re-focus, re-organize to make the current version of the congregation its best version. Re-Vival: That occurs through a visitation of the charismatic, a movement of the Holy Spirit that manifests in a powerful supernatural way. Re-Missioning: By awakening and practically focusing the efforts of the congregation on the Great Commission locally. Whereas Re-Engineering starts with the “church,” Re-Missioning starts with the “commission.” In Re-Engineering the church sets the agenda. In Re-Missioning the mission context sets the agenda.2 ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=167))

- What if God is calling us to put sneakers on our prayers and join what the Spirit is already doing in our neighborhoods and networks? ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=179))
- inherited churches can and are being revitalized by adopting the fresh expressions approach in the mixed economy or blended ecology way. While revitalization is not the goal, it is an effect of joining God’s disruptive cause amid the fragmentation and isolation of human community. Cultivating fresh expressions of church births a missional ecosystem in long-declining congregations. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=181))

- A fresh expression is a form of church for our changing culture, established primarily for the benefit of those who are not yet part of any church. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=200))

- There is no such thing as an expert on revitalization, so be careful with folks who make such claims. Only the Holy Spirit can revitalize congregations and there are countless extraneous variables in every context. However, we can adapt and reorganize existing congregations to place ourselves in the flow of the new rivers the Spirit is creating. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=215))
- Members no longer enjoy relatively steady nine-to-five jobs, pension plans, paid vacations, and weekends off. The new US economic landscape is a 24/7 work culture. Many people now work on weekends. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=314))
- rises in divorce, single parents, stepfamilies, adults who decide not to have children, cohabitating couples, and single persons, all contribute to the decline of the inherited church.4 One practical implication for the church is the reality of visitation in these new parental arrangements, where noncustodial parents rotate weekends. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=335))
- Our systems are designed for the nuclear family model. Essentially, we have not even gone Brady Bunch yet, much less Modern Family! ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=339))
- They are not anti-Jesus, just anti-church. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=347))
- People are open and even hungry for spiritual meaning, but the common assumption is that it cannot be found in institutional religion. The emerging spirituality is once again “protest-ant,” protesting and pushing against the established hierarchies. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=348))
- In the syncretistic new pantheonic thinking, all the gods share the same mythical space. They are equally able to meet spiritual hunger and add value to our lives. Most Christians in the United States now report that “many religions lead to eternal life.” ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=353))
- Why would a newcomer wake up early, on their only day off, and drive to a church for a highly contextual message for a group of strangers? There is no shortage of inspiring messages available at the command of our voice; it only takes two words: “Hey, Siri.” In seconds, a plethora of sermons pop up by professional, polished speakers, not contextually confined to local parishes. Consider the banquet of TED Talks alone, which can be deeply spiritual, may even be equally transformative, not as long, and with no plea for money in the end! ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=368))
- In the network scenario, neighborhoods become secondary to flows of communication, information, and mobility, enabled by technology. People gather across geographic boundaries around shared practices that predominately take place in neutral third places. This shift was captured in The Mission-shaped Church report, “The Western world, at the start of the third millennium, is best described as a ‘network society.’ This is a fundamental change: ‘the emergence of a new social order.’” ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=386))
- The emerging societal structure is constructed around technologically enabled flows of capital, information, organizational interaction, images, sounds, and symbols. The flows refer to the means of social organization, the expression of processes dominating our economic, political, and symbolic life.10 Thus, in a network society, culture is now mobile, moving along a complex web of interconnected networks; flows are about the movement of people, objects, and things from one node to another in social space. Cultures consist of bundles of dynamic practices, connected across space and time through structured flows of information and media. Practices are simply the activities carried out or performed by a group of people habitually or regularly in these social spaces. Flows are the means through which these movements and connections occur. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=397))
- No longer a minority, many good citizens became Christian. This created a need for professional full-time priests to care for the growing masses. This is the attractional model: build it and they will come. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=414))

- We have built it, and they have not come. More Americans now hold a secular worldview than a Christian one. The Christendom model as we know it, our dominant Western version of the faith, is disintegrating. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=418))

- God turns deserts into jungles. God turns cemeteries into gardens. God makes dead things come alive again. We describe the power God uses to do this with the word resurrection. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=430))
- God works with the existing material, reshaping and recreating. God’s way of “making all things new” (Rev. 21:5) is not our consumeristic way of brand-spanking newness and waste. It’s the way of potters remixing at wheels and shattered lives reassembling in new amalgamations. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=432))
- Resurrection is the ultimate narrative of disruption. The empty tomb throws a monkey wrench in the death-dealing cycle of business as usual. It changes everything. Resurrection is the power that dismantles all other forms of power. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=435))
- In Romans, Paul describes the universe as shuttering in the throes of birth pangs, like a woman bared down delivering a child; the broken creation is trembling with the force of new creation by the power of resurrection (Rom. 8:19–23). ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=439))
- life. It is the way of the triune God, it demonstrates the graceful heart of a Creator who refuses to waste anyone or anything. God’s answer to dilapidation is renovation. God’s answer to sin-broken creation is a new creation. God’s answer to isolation is communion. God’s answer to fallen lives is restoration and renewal. God’s answer to polluted ecosystems is a process of healing that brings streams in the deserts, repopulation of forests in barren wastelands, and flowing waters from a restored temple. God’s answer to death is resurrection. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=442))
- God’s answer to decline is revitalization. The God who “[makes] all things new” (Rev. 21:5) is always doing new things. Always making the withered trees flourish again. Across the United States and beyond, God is up to something. In the cracks of the concrete jungle of our post-everything world, new wild seedlings are pushing through and unfurling in a wonderful tapestry of life. Across a Christian landscape that looks and feels like a desert of decline, new oases of life are springing forth. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=446))
- The last time humanity saw the tree of life was during our forceful expulsion from Eden after the epic failure of sin, the fall, and death. Yet the ultimate vision of hope we glimpse here is a return-from-exile kind of hope. There we find ourselves in a glorious new ecosystem. Not as disembodied spirits floating on pillowy clouds playing harps, but in a very real, embodied scenario, back in the very much real garden. A New Jerusalem descends from the heavens. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=452))
- The mega metaphor of this book is the central image of deeply rooted desert trees bursting with wild cascades of life and replicating everywhere. The trees, the inherited churches, are giving and receiving life from emerging forms of life, the fresh expressions. This symbiotic relationship is possible in most contexts and is already starting to happen across the missional frontier. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=465))
- Quite simply, the resurrection power of Jesus operating through inherited forms of church + emerging forms of church = the emergence of a greater whole some would identify as revitalization. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=468))
- Church vitality “experts” spend more time talking through corporate diagrams of church life cycles than telling the stories of the widow of Nain’s son, Jairus’s daughter, Lazarus, Tabitha, Eutychus, or Jesus. The “disembodied souls floating into the cloud” kind of theology leads to a disembodied faith; a faith that no longer sees very embodied, real people in the pews of existing churches as valuable. Congregations that have been outposts of the kingdom of God for many decades become disposable. The valuable properties they have amassed equate to big dollars that can be spent on planting new churches. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=478))
- “Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (John 12:24). ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=489))
- Your church doesn’t need to close; it needs to die. We need to die in the same sense that Jesus describes here. When we are willing to go into the ground, die to our current form, and yield to the power of resurrection, we can emerge fully alive for a new season of harvest. The problem is that most churches are not willing to die. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=494))
- The church is not in the self-preservation business, the church is in the self-donation business. The very eucharistic nature of the body of Christ is to break pieces of ourselves off and give them away to a hungry world. Unfortunately, when our church is caught in a decline cycle, we clench our fists, desperately grasping at what’s left. Yet, if we open our hands and give what we are away through our own self-death, we release God to catalyze resurrection. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=498))
- Our way forward is a journey of death and resurrection, not more institutional solutions to institutional problems. Fresh Expressions is not another “church revitalization strategy” or “save the denomination plan” but a die-and-give-ourselves-away plan. The blended ecology allows local churches to break pieces of themselves off and give them away by planting fresh expressions in their communities. We, in a sense, die so that we can truly live as a new creation. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=502))

- It’s a fresh expression of church called Paws of Praise meeting in a dog park. Churchish things are happening, they just look a little different. Something can’t really be called church unless stepping in crap is a real possibility, right? ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=521))
- Spiritually speaking, the group is a strange amalgamation of folks. A few are mature Christians, some are brand-new Christians, others are surely not Christian. Some are good people, who were hurt by bad Christians. Some are bad people becoming good Christians. A couple of visitors were invited by friends or saw the gathering in Meetup.com or Facebook. Some were just taking their dogs for a walk but were curiously drawn to the gathering. They fill the benches and break out lawn chairs. Some take out the supercomputers in their pockets and read the Scripture Larry is explaining, others just listen. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=533))
- This is just one fresh expression within a larger network of fresh expressions in Wildwood, Florida. Just about every day of the week, one of these gatherings is taking place at various times. Other fresh expressions meet in the local Mexican restaurant, Burritos and Bibles. One meets in a tattoo parlor, Tattoo Parlor Church. One called Connect meets in the Martin Luther King Jr. building. Another meets in a makeshift yoga studio called Yoga Therapy Church. Church 3.1 is a group who gather in a park, then do church on the run . . . literally (a 5k, to be exact.)

- For our purposes, green spaces are the first, second, and third places where people do life. This “place” language comes from the foundational work of sociologist Ray Oldenburg. First Place: The home or primary place of residence. Second Place: The workplace or school place. Third Place: The public places separate from the two usual social environments of home and workplace, that “host regular, voluntary, informal, and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals.” Some examples are environments such as cafes, pubs, clubs, parks, and so on.1 ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=555))

- Futurefitting refers to the planting of fresh expressions in communal ecosystems and restructuring inherited congregations in the blended ecology way to create a sustainable future. Futurefitting is a more appropriate description of the Spirit’s work of cultivating wild colonies of new creation in existing communities. Remember, giving birth and raising the dead are equally reflective of the triune God. God is futurefitting communities now with the life of heaven to come.

- Paul and company then heard about a place of prayer down by the river. (Notice Paul was not a heroic solo leader; they were working together as a team. Luke wrote from a firsthand perspective.) This was a gathering of people in the green spaces, spiritually open, centered around the practice of prayer in whatever form that practice took. Paul worked at the inherited stations, but also knew how to find the gatherings of people doing life together connecting around practices through flows (in his day, the complex system of Roman highways). It was there he could often seed the gospel in alien cultures. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=621))

- We are a sent people with the molecules of the risen Jesus infused in our lungs. Breathing with the very breath of heaven, we are called to go into communities—a breath of fresh air. Fresh expressions allow churches who’ve been holed up in the walls of our inherited churches for too long to go out and be the church in our community. The two can work together in a life-giving exchange. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=639))

- Let us remember the three-ness of this image. This ecosystem is about cultivating the existing tree (Luke 13:6–9) and planting the seeds of the trees to come (Matt. 13:1–9) and grafting them together in one greater vine-like organism (John 15:1–6).

- In that tattoo parlor, we have seen people accept Jesus, take Communion for the first time, ask for prayer requests, become disciples, and occasionally ask about what happens back at the inherited mothership where we gather on Sundays.

- Fresh expressions release the everyday, ordinary heroes of the faith like Sandra to be the church in the green spaces in our communal ecosystems.

Yes—ordained—just not by a bishop with a stole. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=699))

- Now if we want to futurefit this community with new green spaces, we will need to go and plant seeds in each one of these spheres. This is where the fresh expressions of church come in. While we care for and cultivate a healthy inherited church which is the center of the ecosystem, we also deploy pioneers/cultivators into those first, second, third places to create the new green spaces. So, you may start a network of gatherings in peoples’ homes while someone begins a gathering for coworkers in their place of employment, and gathering regularly in one of the third places (i.e., park, community center, restaurant).

- In a revitalization, you, too, will have to make some major adjustments. There will be issues that some people are willing to die for or at least leave the church for.

- Rather, a form of revitalization occurs through the four primary moves of cultivating the blended ecology way. Awakening the local church to their core identity as the priesthood of all believers and remembering the people in our pews as a missionary force for God—a community of apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. Futurefitting the congregation to identify these keystone species, teaching them small behaviors of planting and grafting that create massive cascading change. Then releasing them to the work of adaptive leadership and ecosystem engineering. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=886))
- The first step in cultivating the blended ecology in your community begins not in the green spaces but back at the tree.

- The church had good reasons for adopting the late-twentieth-century corporate structure. It enabled us to flourish for an extended season in an unprecedented way.

The kind of leadership I’m referring to is of the utterly relational, “not so with you” lead from below, “servant” variety, not the “exercise authority over” (Matt. 20:20–28 NIV). The Jesus kind. A journey of withness, as the community travels together in the process of becoming, rather than imposing influence from a place of positional leadership as an expert consultant. This leadership emerges from the group, not by self-assertion, but the rational needs of the group to survive and grow.

It is spontaneous, leaving open different possible futures. It is improvisational—who knows where this may end up! It’s also more fun. There is still leadership, but each person emerges as a leader in different parts of the song—a non-linear dance of followership and leadership.

- In the attractional model, it is easy to get amnesia over the nature of our sent-ness, the very why of our existence. If this amnesia spreads throughout the congregation, one of the essential truths of our Christian faith can become toxic: “‘and they will call him Immanuel’ (which means ‘God with us’)” (Matt. 1:23 NIV).

- Whenever there is an “us,” it always creates a “them.” Whenever the focus is “I,” it can exclude an “other.” When all I can see is “me,” it creates an invisible “you.” When we become so focused on God being with “us,” the very inclusive nature of a community that invited sinners, tax collectors, and prostitutes to the table is reversed. We become exclusive, as in God is only with “us.” You can join us if you look like us, talk like us, and are the same age as us. When a church has become fixated on this exclusive us-ness, then what I call a toxic loop has formed. The toxic loop describes an often unconscious cycle of dysfunction, where a congregation has become entirely “us” fixated to the exclusion of the “them.” The only concern in this community is taking care of each other and preserving the status quo of a past that is no longer based in reality. It’s like a walled city under siege where the people eat each other rather than shift the orientation outward. Imagine a museum that is owned by a group who would rather die staring at the exhibits than sell tickets to let others inside.

- Structures matter. Jesus warns us about pouring new wine into old wineskins. In the process of fermentation and expansion, the new wine would burst the skins. We put new wine into new wineskins, so the fresh, flexible skin can hold and deliver the expanding wine. So “new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved” (Matt. 9:17). Notice the focus is to preserve both/and the new and old wine. We need that fine vintage (attractional) stuff, and the fresh (emerging) stuff. The content stays the same, the container/structure/form changes. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1033))

- Our primary challenge is not to do Jerusalem better. In fact, there are much better resources regarding how to do the attractional model of church better.

- Futurefitting begins with leadership in the inherited church. Antioch started in Jerusalem. The death of Stephen and the oncoming persecution of the gathered church gives birth to the scattered church (Acts 11:19). This is exactly the way Jesus envisioned and structured the movement to take place (Acts 1:8). While Antioch becomes the church in all its fullness, it also stays connected with and gains authority from Jerusalem. The two support each other in a symbiotic way (Acts 11:22, 26–27; 15).

- To reenvision revitalization as cultivating new ecosystems, we need to break free from the corporate emphasis of initiating programs. The mearcstapas (an Old English term from Beowulf) aptly describes the kind of adaptive leadership your team needs. These border-stalkers of the ancient tribes lived on the edges of their groups, moved in and out, and brought back news. Like the mearcstapas, you will need to inhabit the liminal space, and incarnate the role of helping fragmented cultural tribes find hope and reconciliation.3 ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1065))
- Border-stalkers must live in multiple habitats at once. They can move freely between the relational networks. They are mobile and sent, living in a state of motion. Along the journey they build significant relational connections in the various tribes, but their identity is not limited to any single tribe. They must have the capacity to join these hypermobile tribes moving through the space of flows created by technology and be an incarnational presence there, as well as being with the stationary folks who have made a home in the inherited system.

In the blended ecology, we are listening to God, the inherited congregation, and the larger community. This needs to be an intentional focus of the team from the beginning. Spending time in prayer together, studying Scripture together, and checking in with each other about what people are hearing God say—this is all essential work of the team. Unfortunately, many people pass right over this step and pay for it in the long haul, partly because we are not very good at listening in the West. We are hardwired by our culture not to listen.

We cannot have true rapport without the kenotic self-emptying that Christ embodies in the incarnation (Phil. 2:1–11), what Jesus calls “deny[ing]” self (Matt. 16:24).

Sometimes I like to pray, “God, show me what’s breaking your heart in this space. What is sore here?” And then quietly listen.

- Observation: This is simply a form of listening. How many people do you notice in the space? What are they doing? What are the conditions of the neighborhoods where you are? What kinds of isolation do you see? What kind of practices are people participating in? Are people engaging each other in certain ways? How are they dressed? What ways do you see the Holy Spirit at work? What is God up to here? ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1282))

- Encounter: This one is the scariest for people who may not be strong extroverts with evangelistic giftings. Here’s the good news: you don’t have to encounter anyone unless they engage with you or unless God tells you to! More good news: encountering is not about, “Hey, Brother, if you died today do you know your eternal destination?” And it’s also not about a Romans road, sinner’s prayer, or any of that other business. Nor is it about holding up “Jesus saves” signs or blowing on bull horns. When God brings someone into your path and the Spirit nudges toward encounter, start with, “Hello! What’s your name? How are you doing today?” If someone inquires about your activity, let them know you are just out praying for the community and ask, “Is there anything I can pray for you?” ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1285))

- That’s it. No bells and whistles. No fancy evangelism tactics; just pray, observe, and encounter. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1291))
- Who Is Our Sacagawea?: Identifying the Person of Peace ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1292))

- In Jesus’ missional blueprint, we would call Sacagawea our person of peace. This is the person who calls our “uncharted territory” simply “home.” This is the person who Jesus says to find and stay with. Receive their peace and let them receive yours. Notice the reciprocal language of Jesus, if they “[share] in peace, your peace will rest on that person” (Luke 10:6). It’s not just us bringing to them something they need; they also have what we need. There is a language of exchange, not superiority or dominance.

- These are the people who give us an entryway into the community to which we are sent; they translate, contribute, and lead alongside. They open the door to relational potential of that community and they show us “the way things are done around here.” They are the welcomers who offer a safe place. They invite us to the table to be with. They offer us a gift by sharing their lives with us. They teach us the language and the customs of the tribe. As the border-stalkers, we bring good news and presence, but they give us the space to be. It is a reciprocal exchange of blessing and peace.

- Stage 2: Loving/Serving In the Luke 10 missional blueprint, there is the instruction: “Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you . . . cure the sick who are there” (vv. 8–9). Again, I see the language of mutuality. We are dependent upon the welcoming of the people; we also become conduits of the Holy Spirit to cure the sick. Every community is sore and God wants to use the church as an instrument of healing and reconciliation. This serving develops organically from… ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1318))
- It’s imperative that we establish this call to cure on the foundation of building meaningful relationships. As we are welcomed in, doing life with, there is a kind of healing that takes place. The healing often takes the form of loving and serving the people we find there. If the greatest soreness of the sin-fragmented soul is isolation, separating ourselves from God and each other,… ([Location 1323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1323))

- Stage 3: Building Community In Luke 10, there is strong relational language of abiding: “Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide. . . . Do not move about from house to house” (v. 7). Leonard Sweet reminds us, “The story of Christianity didn’t take shape behind pulpits or on altars or in books. No, the story of Christianity takes shape around tables, as people face one another as equals, telling stories, sharing memories, enjoying food with one another.”3 This idea of sharing life, breaking bread, and being the church in the places where life happens is prominent in Jesus’ missional blueprint. In fresh expressions we call this activity “building community.” It is… ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P2L2PM4&location=1329))
