### Highlights

- IF YOU MAKE DISCIPLES, you always get the Church. But if you make a church, you rarely get disciples. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=80))
- We need to understand the church as the effect of discipleship and not the cause. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=81))
- It is far more likely that you will create consumers who depend on the spiritual services that religious professionals provide. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=83))
- somewhere along the way we started separating being “missional” from being a disciple, ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=87))
- we should focus on people who don’t know Jesus yet, but Jesus himself gave us the model for doing that: Disciple people. If you know how to actually make disciples, you’ll reach people who don’t know Jesus. Because that’s simply what disciples do. That was Jesus’ whole plan. If you disciple people, as these people do mission in their everyday comings and goings, with the work and shaping of the Spirit, the future of the church will emerge. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=91))
- Jesus has not called you to build his church. In fact, in all of the Gospels he mentions the church only two times. One time he mentions it, it’s about conflict resolution. The other time? To say that he will build his church. Our job, our only job and the last instructions he gave us, was to make disciples. And out of this we will get the church. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=94))
- Jesus’ model for seeing heaven colliding into earth, for seeing the Kingdom of God advance in community, for seeing the world put to rights and people becoming Christians, was discipleship. Period. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=102))
- Time and time again in the Gospels, we see Jesus functioning as a classic horse-whisperer, inviting his followers into an intimate relationship with him while also initiating a direct challenge to behaviors he knew were either wrong or unhealthy. He drew his disciples closer, loved them, but also gave them the opportunity to accept the responsibilities of discipleship. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=152))
- Fundamentally, effective leadership is based upon an invitation to relationship and a challenge to change. A gifted discipler is someone who invites people into a covenantal relationship with him or her, but challenges that person to live into his or her true identity in very direct yet graceful ways. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=165))
- Challenge may be given from the pulpit or stage on Sunday mornings, but challenge is always given best in the context of personal relationships. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=172))
- So while many churches say, “We do discipleship in our small groups,” the fact of the matter is that their small groups are missing one of the main ingredients of a discipling culture: Challenge. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=180))
- If we have churches with warm, cozy, comfortable, inviting environments, someone is paying the price to make sure that happens. That means for all of the invitation that is offered to a large portion of the people in a church, there is another group that is shouldering all of the expectations and challenge of producing that kind of atmosphere: Church leaders. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=183))
- If you want to free people from the captivity of the client/provider relationship we’ve seen emerge in the church and create an “empowered/discipling culture,” it must be viewed as a must-win battle. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=196))
- What has really captivated us in this discussion of discipleship is the Greek word for “disciple”: mathetes. When directly translated, it means learner. Scripture really seems to be getting at something here, something about orienting our lives around becoming lifelong learners of Jesus. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=212))
- There seem to be three different ways that we learn, but unequivocally, we learn best when there is a dynamic interplay between all three at one time: 1)Classroom/Lecture passing on of information 2)Apprenticeship 3) ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=218))
- Classroom learning is when information, processes and facts are taught from teacher to student in the classic lecture setting. Apprenticeship is when someone learns a certain set of skills by apprenticing himself or herself to someone who has already learned the skills. Immersion is when someone is put into an environment, setting or culture and learns by intuitively picking up what he or she sees and experiences. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=221))
- For instance, if you are learning to become a plumber, you can take hours upon hours of classes, with scads of information on how plumbing systems work, how to deal with leaky sinks and blocked pipes. There is a huge difference between knowing about how to fix a pipe and actually fixing a pipe. At a certain point, the head knowledge from the classroom isn’t enough. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=231))
- Essentially, an apprenticeship is stating, “If you want to learn how to do this, you’re going to need someone to show you how to do it. Information is good, abstract theory and concepts are incredibly helpful, but this actually has to work in the real world.” ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=237))
- the practice of apprenticeship is about investment. Someone invests their time, energy, skills and life into ours, teaching us to do what they do. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=246))
- You learn things, pick up tricks of the trade, learn the language of that culture simply by being in the middle of it. Immersion teaches and shapes in powerful ways that are sometimes hard to even see. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=261))
- The key to immersion is having access to the culture you are hoping to shape you. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=262))
- Bonhoeffer did not separate his Christian life from his family life. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=272))
- Sociologists and education experts agree that learning best happens when there is interplay between all ways of learning. You have to learn the cold, hard facts because they actually mean something and have practical implications. By apprenticing yourself to someone, he or she teaches you how to take things that are only in your head and put them into practice in a way that produces something. You can go from poorly skilled to quite skilled fairly quickly by having an excellent apprenticeship. And if you are able to combine those two things with an immersion experience where the language, the nuances and the everyday uses are learned intuitively . . . well, that is a powerful combination. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=275))
- We learn from the pastor’s teaching on Sunday. We learn from Bible studies. We go to Sunday School. We learn from small group discussion guides and DVDs. We learn from reading books. We learn from taking classes at church. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=286))
- Notice that all of this is completely information driven, in some sort of classroom-esque experience. There is virtually no apprenticing happening in our churches. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=288))
- The hard reality is that immersion works only when people are actually fluent in something. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=293))
- a toddler is never going to learn English if she’s hanging out only with people who don’t know English themselves or if she hangs out only with other toddlers. In other words, ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=295))
- because most churches have so few actual disciples running around, there simply aren’t enough disciples at churches to create a quality immersion experience. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=296))
- Knowing something in your head alone is never what Jesus was after. The truth of Scripture is meant to be worked out in us, not something that we hold as an abstract reality. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=340))
- We don’t want people to understand forgiveness or prayer or mission or justice only intellectually. We want people who can forgive, who can hear and respond to God, who actually know Him. We want people who have hearts that break for our world and the people in it and do something about it. We want the kind of people in our communities who resemble the people we see in Scripture. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=341))
- What these farmers did was partner a young, very energetic ox with a much older, seasoned ox that had plowed the fields for many seasons. The farmers found that the younger ox would push quite hard at the beginning of the day, using up all of his energy and would have nothing left for the second half of the day. Remember, we’re talking eleven- to twelve-hour work days. However, when bridled with an older, more experienced ox, the younger ox would be forced to learn the rhythm and pace of the day. He couldn’t run ahead because he was bridled to the older ox. And so, eventually, the young ox learned the best rhythm from the older ox so he could last for the whole day ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=371))
- TEACHING AND THEOLOGY were ways of describing reality, and then he showed his disciples how to live in that reality. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=398))
- Jesus had what many scholars call his “Retreat Ministry,” a period of time that was dedicated completely to the disciples, when he retreated to places the crowds would never follow, when the disciples could be immersed in relationship and have complete access to him. Here’s the interesting thing: Most people think that at least eighteen months of Jesus’ public ministry was this time. That means at least half of his time was spent with these twelve guys. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=403))
- immersion is about learning the nuances and finer points of something. You learn big chunks of information in the classroom experience and you learn how to develop specific skills in an apprenticing relationship, but with immersion, you see how all of these things start to connect together in even the smallest things. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=408))
- it seems that in watching the life of Jesus and in watching the lives of other disciples (let’s not forget Paul spent quite a bit of time living with disciples before he began his ministry), immersing themselves in the culture, language and rhythms of these men and women, the disciples’ lives seemed to reflect the life and ministry of Jesus in ways beyond sheer coincidence. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=448))
- His equation for extraordinary people goes something like this: Someone with a certain threshold of competency (you don’t have to be a genius) + the right set of circumstances + 10,000 hours of practice (which he guesstimates at about 10 years) = very high chance of success. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=461))
- From our experience doing this, if you want to make disciples, if you want to build a discipling culture in your community, you are going to need three things: 1)A discipleship vehicle (we call it a Huddle) 2)People need access to your life (discipleship can’t be done at a distance) 3)A discipling language (our discipling language is called LifeShapes) ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=473))
- A Huddle is the group of four to ten people you feel God has called you to specifically invest in, and you will meet with them regularly (at least every other week) to intentionally disciple them in a group setting. The best discipling relationships always have an intentional, “organized” component to them, as well as a less formal, “organic” component. Having a regular Huddle meeting is the “organized” component. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=482))
- Huddles grow when members of your Huddle start their own. Why do it this way? Because we take seriously the principle that Jesus established: Every disciple disciples. You can’t be a disciple if you aren’t willing to invest in and disciple others. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=486))
- For instance, we have a friend who started two Huddles two years ago. One Huddle was part of his local church; the second was for pastors who were interested in learning to Huddle. Two years later, after that small investment in the lives of about ten people, more than seventy Huddles have been started and they keep reproducing. That’s the making of a movement. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=495))
- An organic part of discipling people happens outside a Huddle. That means you need to give these four to ten people much higher ACCESS to your life than other people get or than you are probably accustomed to giving the people you currently lead. You’ll need to be strategic with your time if you are going to build a discipling culture that will bear long-term fruit. You will need to simplify your life so you have space for people to be invited into your life and home. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=500))
- We suggest that if you want to be a disciple, and if you want the people you disciple to be able to disciple others who then disciple others, you will need to follow the path of Information to Imitation to Innovation. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=540))
- Lastly, on a very practical note, if you are a pastor, we highly recommend you not teach LifeShapes in a sermon series. If you do this, you will be subtly telling your community that this is just another program, but more importantly, it’ll come across as more information for them to engage or ignore. The best way to teach LifeShapes is in the context of a Huddle where you have all three types of learning functioning together. We’ve learned this the hard way and seen other pastors make this mistake. Learn from our mistakes! ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005HQDUK4&location=669))
