### Highlights

- Consider adult narcissism as being located on a continuum. On one end, there is healthy adult narcissism that is mature and realistic (Kohut 1977). On the other end, there is pathological narcissism that is extremely immature, very unrealistic, and completely self-serving. In between the two ends lies undeveloped narcissism, where some aspects of the person have progressed to the healthy end, some may still be in the immature range, and still others are in the process of developing. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=196))
- Think of the immature range as that which contains behaviors and attitudes that are expected of infants and children but that signal immaturity and undeveloped narcissism in adults, such as constantly boasting or bragging, expecting others to immediately meet one’s demands without protest, or taking unnecessary risks that can be very self-destructive. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=199))
- The self-absorption or narcissism discussed in this book is where the person exhibits many of the behaviors and attitudes of the person with the diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) as described in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but it is not an NPD. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=203))
- persons with immature or undeveloped narcissism are unaware that they exhibit behaviors and attitudes reflective of an earlier stage of development and tend to be oblivious of the impact these have on others. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=212))
- Self-absorption occurs when there is a continual and extreme focus on one’s self in almost every situation and circumstance. Actions by self-absorbed people are based on their needs most or all of the time, even when some of their acts seem to benefit others. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=220))
- Grandiosity: Your parent has unreasonable expectations for success, performance, wealth, and the like. The parent wants to win all of the time, knows what’s best for others, and does not have a logical or reasonable sense of their personal limitations. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=226))
- Entitlement attitude: This attitude is one that assumes that everyone else is just an extension of one’s self and therefore that others are under one’s control and just exist to meet one’s own needs, even unspoken ones. Others are not recognized as separate and distinct individuals. The parent expects and demands preferential treatment and feels that their needs should receive priority over the needs of others. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=229))
- their critical, demeaning, and devaluing comments about you and others, but simultaneously expects others to be empathic toward the parent. The parent constantly blames others… ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=233))
- Extensions of self: Since the parent does not recognize others as separate individuals, the parent expects favors but does not return them. The parent gives orders and expects these to be promptly carried out, and expects others to know what is wanted without the parent having to speak. The parent asks intrusive personal questions and tells… ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=235))
- Impoverished self: The behaviors that signal the impoverished self include constantly complaining about being deprived, excluded, or minimized, even when there is no evidence to support this perspective. The parent may be self-depreciating, but will become angry or hurt if others agree with the self-depreciating comments. The… ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=239))
- Attention seeking: Most of these behaviors and attitudes are easily seen, as the parent usually does some or all of them. Examples includes speaking loudly, talking a lot, entering and exiting rooms noisily,… ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=242))
- Admiration seeking: These behaviors are those that are constantly done for public approval and approbation, which the parent craves as external signs of worthiness, superiority, and the like. The parent boasts and brags about their accomplishments and is self-promoting for awards and other recognitions.… ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=245))
- Shallow emotions: Self-absorbed parents express and experience few emotions, usually only anger and fear. They use the words for feelings,… ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=248))
- Envy: Envy is displayed by saying and doing things that reflect resentment of others’ success, accomplishments, possessions, or opportunities. The parent reacts by feeling that other persons are not deserving… ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=250))
- Contempt: Contempt is a part of feeling superior, where the person thinks that others are less deserving, worthwhile, or valuable. An example is when the parent makes negative and demeaning comments about others’ value and… ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=253))
- Arrogance: This attitude of feeling vastly superior to others can be seen in behaviors such as talking down or patronizingly to others. The parent is not shy about letting others know that they are perceived as inferior and… ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=256))
- Reverse parenting: This occurs when the child is made responsible for the parent’s well-being instead of the usual expectation that the parent is responsible for the child’s well-being. Behaviors that signal this attitude include statements like the following: “If you loved me, you would…” “I love you when you…” “Don’t you want me to love you?” “You make me feel good when… ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=262))
- Basks in the child’s reflected glory: This parent demands that the child become and do what the parent desires, for example, by excelling in athletics and school achievement or displaying other talents. The child must be very successful or the parent will be displeased.… ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=266))
- Intolerant of child’s values and needs: The parent cannot perceive the child as a separate and distinct individual, but only as an extension of the parent. They cannot tolerate disagreement or any hint of criticism, want to always be perceived as perfect,… ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=269))
- Exploits others: This behavior and attitude are also reflections of an inability to perceive and relate to others as separate, different, and worthwhile individuals. Others are perceived as existing for the parent’s benefit and as subject to exploitive behaviors, such as taking unfair… ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=272))
- Do you have difficulty forming satisfying and meaningful relationships that endure? ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=300))
- Do you find it difficult to express a wide variety of emotions? ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=303))
- Do you become overwhelmed by others’ emotions and find it hard to let go of them? Do you become enmeshed in others’ emotions? Do you tend to take others’ comments and actions personally? ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=304))
- Do you have difficulty controlling negative feelings such as anger and resentment? ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=307))
- Do you stay on edge and anxious about trying to please others? ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=308))
- Emotional susceptibility is the tendency to “catch” others’ feelings (usually negative feelings), incorporate these feelings into your self, and then find that you are unable to easily release them. Your psychological boundary strength was not sufficiently developed as you were growing up, so you’re less able to screen out and choose which emotions of others you can accept and which the other person should keep. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=319))
- Constantly monitor others and try to discern what they are feeling, so that you can take care of them if they seem to need something or to be in distress. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=322))
- Feel that you must have others’ liking and approval most or all of the time. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=325))
- Take on the responsibility for others’ welfare or emotional well-being, even if they are independent adults who can care for themselves. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=327))
- Stay constantly on edge, churned up, or even upset, and cannot let go of these feelings. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=328))
- Feel fearful of any signals that there is conflict present, even when you are not involved. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=329))
- Feel positive or happy only when those around you are feeling the same way. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=331))
- The compliant response has the child trying harder and harder to please the parent, a reaction that extends into adulthood, where considerable effort goes into trying to always please others and anxiety is experienced when others do not seem to be pleased. This response also includes searching anxiously for nonverbal signals of distress, desires, or needs; the inability to be content with less than perfection; never feeling adequate; and relying mostly on others for validation. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=336))
- try to please the parent because they realize that pleasing the parent is not possible. The child then acts in a way that conveys that they don’t care what others think about them. They don’t try to discern what others want or need, keep a distance from others, and retreat into a self-protective stance. This stance makes it difficult for this person to trust others and works against establishing meaningful and satisfying relationships. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=341))
- Compliant children who have a needy self-absorbed parent may, even as adults, be overly sensitive to others’ needs. Some of their unconscious responses can be constantly monitoring others for signs of distress; trying to discern others’ unmet needs; and trying to read other people’s minds, attempting to know how to respond or behave even before a request is made. Such adult children are still very anxious and fearful of disagreements and other forms of conflict, will subordinate their own personal needs most of the time, feel guilt and shame when others are disappointed, and do things that they don’t want to do in an effort to please others. In so doing, they can be easily seduced and often become enmeshed in others’ feelings. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=398))
- Rebellious response: Children who respond rebelliously to the behavior of the needy narcissistic parent as adults will tend to keep others at a distance, often refusing to connect or engage. These adult children of self-absorbed parents may be insensitive or may ignore others’ needs. They tend to openly disagree with others, but then withdraw from conflict. They are resentful when others try to seduce or coerce them. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=404))
- Parental empathic attunement and response helps build a child’s self-esteem. If your parent was unable or unwilling to provide sufficient empathy because of their self-absorption, then you did not receive the empathy conducive to feeling worthy, cherished, and loved. While not all of your self-esteem is affected by empathy or its lack, you may still be struggling with major self-esteem deficits. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=498))
- These early injuries can nevertheless still impact you in indirect, hidden, and masked ways. For example, some will find that they cannot initiate and maintain meaningful and enduring relationships, and others will find that they are easily wounded by criticism. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=515))
- It is my responsibility to always take care of others. Although it is commendable to be concerned about others, it is not reasonable for you to automatically assume responsibility for everyone, to be overly protective, to not accept and believe that others are capable of self-care, to be intrusive with your acts of caring, to insist that others accept these acts, or to feel guilty or ashamed when others are in distress. These are signs that you may be overly responsible, that you don’t understand the limits of your personal responsibility and that you are unaware of others’ desires for independence and autonomy. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=570))
- Other people’s needs are more important than mine. You may have internalized early in your life that your needs were not as important as others’ needs were. Lack of empathy from a parent or caretaker, neglect, blame, criticism, failure to accept you as you are and appreciate your qualities, and other such experiences could have shaped your belief that others’ needs should be placed above your own. It will be difficult for you to overcome this belief and achieve a satisfactory balance between appropriate self-care and the need to take care of others. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=576))
- Self-affirmation: I like and want this person’s approval, but I will be okay if I don’t get it. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=617))
- Self-affirmation: I may help more by showing confidence that the other person can fix it. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=643))
- Self-affirmation: I deserve to be given preference sometimes, and self-care is also important. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=655))
- Avoid personalizing what others say and do, because personalizing produces shame, guilt, and additional hurt. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=883))
- More accurately judge external threats to yourself and thereby reduce the number of times when you feel anger and fear. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=884))
- You tend to personalize others’ comments. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=904))
- When something doesn’t go right at home or at work, you feel that others are blaming you for what happened. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=905))
- You feel that other people are pointing out your flaws and imperfections if they don’t compliment or praise you. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=908))
- You tend to catch other people’s feelings, especially their negative feelings, such as anger, disgust, and sadness. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=910))
- You are supposed to please others, just as you were expected to please your parent. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=953))
- You tend to assume that others are disappointed without having sufficient evidence that they are, and that you are at fault for not meeting their expectations. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=958))
- Your basic responsibility is to live up to your own standards; if that pleases others, their approval is icing on the cake. You do not have a responsibility to always please others, nor do you have a responsibility to monitor your actions so that others are not disappointed. You are not responsible for others’ feelings, just as others are not responsible for your feelings. Yes, you may do or say something that they view as disappointing, but the choice of what they feel is up to them. The important thing is that you act in accord with your own values, and in a manner so that you will not be disappointed in yourself. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=964))
- Receiving some acknowledgment of your competence, efforts, and the like is most always appreciated, but a constant need for such acknowledgments can indicate a requirement for reassurance. This is especially true when you interpret a lack of compliments and praise as the other person pointing out your flaws and imperfections. You are using an absence (no positive feedback) to infer a negative (that they mean to indicate that you are flawed and imperfect) and, as a result, you may be very easily wounded by this irrational thought or belief. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=972))
- Your inability to overlook, ignore, or let go of minor actions that produce feelings such as irritation and annoyance can be traced, in part, to what you think the triggering acts are saying about you. You become irritated or annoyed when you sense a threat to yourself. Most irritating and annoying acts present no real threat and can be overlooked or ignored. Further, holding on to these annoyances can have negative effects on your health, sense of well-being, and relationships. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=986))
- Do you want to get away when interacting with people who are emotionally intense and find that you retain some anxiety even after leaving them? These are examples of how you can experience catching others’ emotions. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=1022))
- Feeling that you are responsible for the other person’s feelings. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=1033))
- Trying to make the feelings go away for the other person so that that person will feel better, because this also allows you to feel better. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=1034))
- I am very dissatisfied with my accomplishments. ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YWF881J&location=1514))
