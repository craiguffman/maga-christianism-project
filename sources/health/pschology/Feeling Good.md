### Highlights

- Every bad feeling you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. Illogical pessimistic attitudes play the central role in the development and continuation of all your symptoms. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=665))

- You will learn, as she did, that the negative thoughts that flood your mind are the actual cause of your self-defeating emotions. These thoughts are what keep you lethargic and make you feel inadequate. Your negative thoughts, or cognitions, are the most frequently overlooked symptoms of your depression. These cognitions contain the key to relief and are therefore your most important symptoms. Every time you feel depressed about something, try to identify a corresponding negative thought you had just prior to and during the depression. Because these thoughts have actually created your bad mood, by learning to restructure them, you can change your mood.

- When the all-too-human performance of other people falls short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you'll feel bitter and self-righteous. You'll either have to change your expectations to approximate reality or always feel let down by human behavior. If you recognize this bad should habit in yourself, I have outlined many effective "should and shouldn't" removal methods in later chapters on guilt and anger.

- what, in the final analysis, is the source of genuine self-esteem? This, in my opinion, is the most important question you will ever confront. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1134))

- In practical terms the study indicated that during periods of depression you lose some of your capacity for clear thinking; you have trouble putting things into proper perspective. Negative events grow in importance until they dominate your entire reality—and you can't really tell that what is happening is distorted. It all seems very real to you. The illusion of hell you create is very convincing. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1153))

- What I want to know is what your Irritability Quotient is. This refers to the amount of anger and annoyance you tend to absorb and harbor in your daily life. If you have a particularly high IQ, it puts you at a great disadvantage because you overreact to frustrations and disappointments by creating feelings of resentment that blacken your disposition and make your life a joyless hassle.

- When you're mad at someone, you automatically make them the cause of all your bad feelings. You say, "You're annoying me! You're getting on my nerves." When you think like this, you're actually fooling yourself because other people really cannot make you angry.

- No matter how outrageous or unfair others might appear to you, they do not, never did, and never will upset you. The bitter truth is that you're the one who's creating every last ounce of the outrage you experience. ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2497))

- Anger, like all emotions, is created by your cognitions. The relationship between your thoughts and your anger is shown in Figure 7–1. As you will note, before you can feel irritated by any event you must first become aware of what is occurring and come to your own interpretation of it. Your feelings result from the meaning you give to the event, not from the event itself. ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2500))

- You are certainly right that plenty of genuinely negative events do go on every day, but your feelings about them are still created by the interpretations you place on them. Take a careful look at these interpretations because anger can be a two-edged sword. The consequences of an impulsive outburst will frequently defeat you in the long run. Even if you are being genuinely wronged, it may not be to your advantage to feel angry about it. The pain and suffering you inflict on yourself by feeling outraged may far exceed the impact of the original insult.

- What kinds of distortion occur most often when you are angry? One of the greatest offenders is labeling. When you describe the person you're mad at as "a jerk" or "a bum" or "a piece of shit," you see him in a totally negative way. You could call this extreme form of overgeneralization "globalizing" or "monsterizing." Someone may in fact have betrayed your trust, and it is absolutely right to resent what that person did. In contrast, when you label someone, you create the impression that he or she has a bad essence. You are directing your anger toward what that person "is." ([Location 2525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2525))

- Labeling is a distorted thinking process that causes you to feel inappropriately indignant and morally superior. It's destructive to build your self-image this way: Your labeling will inevitably give way to your need to blame the other person. Your thirst for retaliation intensifies the conflict and brings out similar attitudes and feelings in the person you're mad at. Labeling inevitably functions as a self-fulfilling prophecy. You polarize the other person and bring about a state of interpersonal warfare. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2532))

- There is one and only one person in this world who has the power to threaten your self-esteem—and that is you. Your sense of worth can go down only if you put yourself down. The real solution is to put an end to your absurd inner harangue. ([Location 2540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2540))
    - **Tags:** #blue
- Another distortion characteristic of anger-generating thoughts is mind reading—you invent motives that explains to your satisfaction why the other person did what he or she did. These hypotheses are frequently erroneous because they will not describe the actual thoughts and perceptions that motivated the other person. Due to your indignation, it may not occur to you to check out what you are saying to yourself. ([Location 2542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2542))
- The third form of distortion that leads to anger is magnification. If you exaggerate the importance of the negative event, the intensity and duration of your emotional reaction may get blown up out of all proportion. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2554))
- Inappropriate should and shouldn't statements represent the fourth type of distortion that feeds your anger. When you find that some people's actions are not to your liking, you tell yourself they "shouldn't" have done what they did, or they "should have" done something they failed to do. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2559))
- For example, suppose you register at a hotel and discover they lost the record of your reservation, and now there are no rooms available. You furiously insist, "This shouldn't have happened! Those stupid goddam clerks!" ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2561))

- Does the actual deprivation cause your anger? No. The deprivation can only create a sense of loss, disappointment, or inconvenience. Before you can feel anger, you must necessarily make the interpretation you are entitled to get what you want in this situation. Consequently, you see the goof-up on your reservation as an injustice. This perception leads to your feeling angry. ([Location 2563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2563))

- Irrational should statements rest on your assumption that you are entitled to instant gratification at all times. So on those occasions when you don't get what you want, you go into panic or rage because of your attitude that unless you get X, you will either die or be tragically deprived of joy forever (X can represent love, affection, status, respect, promptness, perfection, niceness, etc.). This insistence that your wants be gratified at all times is the basis for much self-defeating anger. People who are anger-prone often formulate their desires in moralistic terms such as this: If I'm nice to someone, they should be appreciative. ([Location 2570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2570))

- Other people have free will, and often think and act in ways that aren't to your liking. All of your insistence that they must fall in line with your desires and wishes will not produce this result. The opposite is more often true. Your attempts to coerce and manipulate people with angry demands most often will alienate and polarize them and make them much less likely to want to please you. This is because other people don't like being controlled or dominated any more than you do. Your anger will simply limit the creative possibilities for problem solving.

- The perception of unfairness or injustice is the ultimate cause of most, if not all, anger. In fact, we could define anger as the emotion which corresponds in a one-to-one manner to your belief that you are being treated unfairly. ([Location 2579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2579))

- Much everyday anger results when we confuse our own personal wants with general moral codes. When you get mad at someone and you claim that they are acting "unfairly," more often than not what is really going on is that they are acting "fairly" relative to a set of standards and a frame of reference that differs from yours. Your assumption that they are "being unfair" implies that your way of looking at things is universally accepted. For this to be the case, everyone would have to be the same. But we aren't. We all think differently. When you overlook this and blame the other person for being "unfair" you are unnecessarily polarizing the interaction because the other person will feel insulted and defensive. Then the two of you will argue fruitlessly about who is "right." The whole dispute is based on the illusion of "absolute fairness."

- So the real question is not "Should I or should I not feel anger?" but rather "Where will I draw the line?" The following two guidelines will help you to determine when your anger is productive and when it is not. These two criteria can help you synthesize what you are learning and to evolve a meaningful personal philosophy about anger: Is my anger directed toward someone who has knowingly, intentionally, and unnecessarily acted in a hurtful manner? Is my anger useful? Does it help me achieve a desired goal or does it simply defeat me? ([Location 2630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2630))

- Suppose your three-year-old son runs mindlessly into the street and risks his life. In this case he is not intentionally inflicting harm. Nevertheless, the angry mode in which you express yourself may be adaptive. The emotional arousal in your voice conveys a message of alarm and importance that might not come across if you were to deal with him in a calm, totally objective manner. In both these examples, you chose to be angry, and the magnitude and expression of the emotion were under your control. The adaptive and positive effects of your anger differentiate it from hostility, which is impulsive and uncontrolled and leads to aggression.

- because anger is caused by what you perceive to be unfair, it is a moral emotion, and you will be extremely hesitant to let go of the righteous feeling. You will have the nearly irresistible urge to defend and justify your anger with religious zeal. Overcoming this will require an act of great willpower.

- The first step: Use the double-column technique to make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of feeling angry and acting in a retaliatory manner. Consider both the short- and long-term consequences of your anger. Then review the list and ask yourself which are greater, the costs or the benefits? This will help you determine if your resentment is really in your best self-interest. Since most of us ultimately want what's best for us, this can pave the way for a more peaceful and productive attitude. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2652))
- It is crucial that you perform this same type of analysis as a first step in coping with your anger. After you list the advantages and disadvantages of your anger, give yourself the same test. Ask yourself, if the upsetting situation that provokes me doesn't change immediately, would I be willing to cope with it instead of getting angry? If you can answer yes, then you are clearly motivated to change. You will probably succeed in gaining greater inner peace and self-esteem, and you will increase your effectiveness in life. This choice is up to you. ([Location 2703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2703))

- Cool Those Hot Thoughts. Once you've decided to cool down, an invaluable method that can help you is to write down the various "hot thoughts" that are going through your mind when you are upset. Then substitute less upsetting, more objective "cool thoughts," using the double-column method (Figure 7–3). Listen for those "hot thoughts" with your "third ear" so as to tune in to the antagonistic statements that go through your head. Record this private dialogue without any censorship. I'm sure you'll notice all kinds of highly colorful language and vengeful fantasies—write them all down. Then substitute "cool thoughts" that are more objective and less inflammatory. This will help you feel less aroused and overwhelmed. ([Location 2707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2707))

- These daydreams actually keep your anger alive long after the initial insult has occurred. Your sense of rage may eat away at you for hours, days, months, or even years after the irritating event has long since passed. Your fantasies help keep the pain alive. Every time you fantasize about the occurrence you shoot new doses of arousal into your system. You become like a cow chewing on poison cud.

- You are the director and producer of the film now, and, what's worse, you're the only one in the audience, Who has to watch and experience all the arousal? YOU DO! You're the one who's subjected to a continual clenching, a tightening of back muscles, and an outpouring of adrenal hormones into the bloodstream. You're the one whose blood pressure is going up. IN A NUTSHELL: You're making yourself hurt. Do you want to keep this up? ([Location 2783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2783))

- One helpful technique is to transform them in a creative way so they become less upsetting. Humor represents one powerful tool you can use. For example, instead of imagining wringing the neck of the person you are furious with, fantasize that he is walking around in diapers in a crowded department store. Visualize all the details: the potbelly, the diaper pins, the hairy legs. Now what's happening to your anger? Is that a broad smile spreading across your face?

- A second method involves thought stoppage. As you notice the images crossing your mind each day, remind yourself that you have the right to turn the projector off. Think about something else. Find someone and engage him or her in conversation. Read a good book. Bake bread. Go jogging. When you don't reward the anger images with your arousal, they will recur less and less often. Instead of dwelling on them, think about an upcoming event that excites you, or switch to an erotic fantasy. If the upsetting memory is persistent, engage in vigorous physical exercise such as pushups, rapid jogging, or swimming. These have the additional benefit of rechanneling your potentially hurtful arousal in a highly beneficial way. ([Location 2790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2790))
- Rewrite the Rules. You may frustrate and upset yourself needlessly because you have an unrealistic rule about personal relationships that causes you to be let down all the time. The key to Sue's anger was her belief she was entitled to John's love because of her rule "If I'm a good and faithful wife, I deserve to be loved." ([Location 2795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2795))
- As a result of this innocent-sounding assumption, Sue experienced a constant sense of danger in her marriage because anytime John wasn't giving her an appropriate helping of love and attention, she would experience it as a confirmation of her inadequacy. She would then manipulate and demand attention and respect in a constant battle to defend herself against a loss of self-esteem. ([Location 2798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2798))
- But the price Sue pays is that the love she receives isn't—and can't—be given freely and spontaneously. He will feel exhausted, trapped, and controlled. The resentment he's been storing up will press for release. When he stops buying into her belief that he has to give in to her demands, his desire for freedom will overpower him, and he will explode. The destructive effects of what passes for love never cease to amaze me! ([Location 2805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2805))
- If you adopt a more realistic attitude, you can end your frustration. It's much easier than trying to change the world. Sue decided to revise her "love" rule in the following way: "If I behave in a positive manner toward John, he will respond in a loving way a good bit of the time. I can still respect myself and function effectively when he doesn't." ([Location 2809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2809))
- It's an undeniable fact that human relationships, including marriages, are rarely spontaneously "reciprocal" because people are different. Reciprocity is a transient and inherently unstable ideal that can only be approximated through continued effort. This involves mutual consensus, communication, compromise, and growth. It requires negotiation and hard work. ([Location 2817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2817))
- She lived in a fairytale world where reciprocity existed as an assumed reality. She went around always doing good things for her husband and others and then waited for their reciprocity. Unfortunately, these unilateral contracts fell apart because other people usually weren't aware that she expected to be repaid.

- All human beings have the right to get mad whether or not they're treated unfairly. The real issue is—is it to my advantage to get mad? Do I want to feel angry? What are the costs and benefits? ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2850))
- Everyone doesn't live by my rules, so why expect they will? People will often treat me as well as I treat them, but not always. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2855))
- Initially she terminated all these calls after five to ten minutes to ensure the likelihood the conversations would not deteriorate into an argument or become boring to him. This guaranteed that her feedback would be pleasant to him, and that his response to it would not be suppressed or eliminated. ([Location 2912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2912))
- "Should" Reduction. Because many of the thoughts which generate your anger involve moralistic "should" statements, it will help you to master some "should" removal methods. One way is to make a list, using the double-column method, of all the reasons why you believe the other person "shouldn't" have acted as he did. Then challenge these reasons until you can see why they are unrealistic and don't actually make good sense. ([Location 2928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2928))
- By empathy, I do not mean the capacity to feel the same way someone else feels. This is sympathy. Sympathy is highly touted but is, in my opinion, somewhat overrated. ([Location 3016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3016))
- By empathy, I do not mean acting in a tender, understanding manner. This is support. Support is also highly valued and overrated. ([Location 3017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3017))
- Remember, it is actually your thoughts that create your anger and not the other person's behavior. The amazing thing is that the moment you grasp why the other person is acting that way, this knowledge tends to put the lie to your anger-producing thoughts.

- It will be crucial not to evaluate your progress in your anger-reduction program in an all-or-nothing way because emotional growth takes some time, especially when it comes to anger. If you ordinarily react to a particular provocation with 99 percent anger and then find you become 70 percent upset next time, you could view this as a successful first try. Now keep working at it, using your cognitive rehearsal method, and see if you can reduce it to 50 percent and then to 30 percent. Eventually you will make it vanish altogether, or at least you will have brought it down to an acceptable, irreducible minimum.

- A great deal of your anger involves your defense against loss of self-esteem when people criticize you, disagree with you, or fail to behave as you want them to. Such anger is always inappropriate because only your own negative distorted thoughts can cause you to lose self-esteem. When you blame the other guy for your feelings of worthlessness, you are always fooling yourself. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3225))

- Frustration results from unmet expectations. Since the event that disappointed you was a part of "reality," it was "realistic." Thus, your frustration always results from your unrealistic expectation. You have the right to try to influence reality to bring it more in line with your expectations, but this is not always practical, especially when these expectations represent ideals that don't correspond to everyone else's concept of human nature. The simplest solution would be to change your expectations. For example, some unrealistic expectations that lead to frustration include: If I want something (love, happiness, a promotion, etc.), I deserve it. If I work hard at something, I should be successful. Other people should try to measure up to my standards and believe in my concept of "fairness." I should be able to solve any problems quickly and easily. If I'm a good wife, my husband is bound to love me. People should think and act the way I do. If I'm nice to someone, they should reciprocate. ([Location 3228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3228))

- What is the difference between "healthy sadness" and depression? The distinction is simple. Sadness is a normal emotion created by realistic perceptions that describe a negative event involving loss or disappointment in an undistorted way. Depression is an illness that always results from thoughts that are distorted in some way. For example, when a loved one dies, you validly think, "I lost him (or her), and I will miss the companionship and love we shared." The feelings such a thought creates are tender, realistic, and desirable. Your emotions will enhance your humanity and add depth to the meaning of life. In this way you gain from your loss. In contrast, you might tell yourself, "I'll never again be happy because he (or she) died. It's unfair!" These thoughts will trigger in you feelings of self-pity and hopelessness. Because these emotions are based entirely on distortion, they will defeat you. ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3742))

- Either depression or sadness can develop after a loss or a failure in your efforts to reach a goal of great personal importance. Sadness comes, however, without distortion. It involves a flow of feeling and therefore has a time limit. It never involves a lessening of your self-esteem. Depression is frozen—it tends to persist or recur indefinitely, and always involves loss of self-esteem. ([Location 3749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=3749))

- My point is this: When a genuinely negative event occurs, your emotions will be created exclusively by your thoughts and perceptions. Your feelings will result from the meaning you attach to what happens. A substantial portion of your suffering will be due to the distortions in your thoughts. When you eliminate these distortions, you will find that coping with the "real problem" will become less painful.

- A silent assumption is an equation with which you define your personal worth. It represents your value system, your personal philosophy, the stuff on which you base your self-esteem. Examples: (1) "If someone criticizes me, I feel miserable because this automatically means there is something wrong with me." (2) "To be a truly fulfilled human being, I must be loved. If I am alone, I am bound to be lonely and miserable." (3) "My worth as a human being is proportional to what I've achieved." (4) "If I don't perform (or feel or act) perfectly, I have failed." As you will learn, these illogical assumptions can be utterly self-defeating. They create a vulnerability that predisposes you to uncomfortable mood swings. They represent your psychological Achilles' heel. ([Location 4177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=4177))

- V. Entitlement. Attitudes 21 through 25 measure your sense of "entitlement." A negative score indicates that you feel "entitled" to things—success, love, happiness, etc. You expect and demand that your wants be met by other people and by the universe at large because of your inherent goodness or hard work. When this does not happen—as is often the case—you are locked into one of two reactions. Either you feel depressed and inadequate or you become irate. Thus, you consume enormous amounts of energy being frustrated, sad, and mad. Much of the time you see life as a sour, rotten experience. You complain loudly and often, but you do little to solve problems. After all, you're entitled to have them solved, so why should you have to put out any effort? As a result of your bitter, demanding attitudes, you invariably get far less of what you want from life. ([Location 4364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=4364))

- A positive score suggests you don't feel automatically entitled to things, so you negotiate for what you want and often get it. Because of your awareness that other people are unique and different, you realize there is no inherent reason why things should always go your way. You experience a negative outcome as a disappointment but not a tragedy because you are a percentage player, and you don't expect perfect reciprocity or "justice" at all times. You are patient and persistent, and you have a high frustration tolerance. As a result, you often end up ahead of the pack.

- Did it ever occur to you that if someone disapproves of you, it might be his or her problem? Disapproval often reflects other people's irrational beliefs. To take an extreme example, Hitler's hateful doctrine that Jews were inferior did not reflect anything about the inner worth of the people he intended to destroy.

- If you admit your disapproval does not contain enough moral atomic power to devastate the meaning and value of another person's life, why give their disapproval the power to wipe out your sense of self-worth? What makes them so special? When you tremble in terror because someone dislikes you, you magnify the wisdom and knowledge that person possesses, and you have simultaneously sold yourself short as being unable to make sound judgments about yourself.

- But he struggled intensely to please his mother with his achievements and his career in a desperate bid to win her approval.

He tried to compensate for his missing self-esteem by earning other people's admiration and approval. His life was like a constant effort to inflate a balloon with a hole in it.

- Cost-Benefit Analysis. The first step in overcoming your belief in any of the self-defeating assumptions from the DAS test is to perform a cost-benefit analysis.

- Rewrite the Assumption. If, based on your cost-benefit analysis, you see that your fear of disapproval hurts you more than it helps, the second step is to rewrite your silent assumption so that it becomes more realistic and more self-enhancing (you can do this with any of the 35 attitudes on the DAS test that represent areas of psychological vulnerability for you).

- The Self-Respect Blueprint. As a third step it might help you to write a brief essay entitled "Why It Is Irrational and Unnecessary to Live in Fear of Disapproval or Criticism." This can be your personal blueprint for achieving greater self-reliance and autonomy. Prepare a list of all the reasons why disapproval is unpleasant but not fatal. A few have already been mentioned in this chapter, and you might review them before you begin to write. In your essay include only what seems convincing and helpful to you. Make sure you believe each argument you write down so your new sense of independence will be realistic. ([Location 4548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=4548))

- You will have to develop your social skills and master some powerful secrets of making people feel attracted to you. These are: (1) Don't sell yourself short by looking down on yourself. Refuse to persecute yourself. Boost your self-esteem to the hilt with the methods outlined in Chapter 4. If you love yourself, people will respond to this sense of joy you radiate and want to be close to you. (2) Express genuine compliments to people. Instead of waiting around nervously to find out if they will like you or reject you, like them first and let them know about it. (3) Show an interest in other people by learning about what turns them on. Get them to talk about what excites them most, and respond to their comments in an upbeat manner.

- Schedule one or more periods of time each day—five to ten minutes are probably enough—to think all the sad, angry, and despairing thoughts you want. If you feel sad, cry. If you feel mad, pound a pillow. Keep flooding yourself with painful memories and thoughts for the full time period you have set aside. Bitch, moan and complain nonstop! When your scheduled sad period is over, STOP IT and carry on with life until your next scheduled cry session. In the meantime, if you have negative thoughts, write them down, pinpoint the distortions, and substitute rational responses as outlined in previous chapters. You may find this will help you gain partial control over your disappointment and hasten your return to full self-esteem more quickly than you anticipated.

- If you take the position you "need" someone else for a sense of worth, you broadcast the following: "Take me! I have no inherent worth! I can't stand myself!" No wonder there are so few buyers!

- If this is your fear, you are equating dependency with warmth. Nothing could be farther from the truth. If you are lonely and dependent, your anger and resentment stem from the fact that you feel deprived of the love you believe you are entitled to receive from others. This attitude drives you farther into isolation. If you are more independent, you are not obliged to be alone—you simply have the capacity to feel happy when you are alone. The more independent you are, the more secure you will be in your feelings. Furthermore, your moods will not go up and down at someone else's mercy. After all, the amount of love that someone can feel for you is often quite unpredictable. They may not appreciate everything about you, and they may not act in an affectionate way all the time. If you are willing to learn to love yourself, you will have a far more dependable and continuous source of self-esteem.

- Because she assumed it was miserable to be alone, it hadn't occurred to her to do enjoyable things and care for herself during the separation from her husband. She had been living according to a double standard whereby if she was with her husband, she would go to great lengths to plan pleasurable activities, but when she was alone, she would simply mope and do very little. This pattern obviously functioned as a self-fulfilling prophecy, and she did in fact find it unpleasant to be alone. Why? Simply because she failed to treat herself in a caring way. It had never occurred to her to challenge her lifelong assumption that all her activities would be unsatisfactory unless she had someone to share them with.

- The essence of this method was: (1) Don't turn Hank off by defending yourself. Instead, do the opposite—urge him to say all the worst things he can say about you. (2) Try to find a grain of truth in all his criticisms and then agree with him. (3) After this, point out any areas of disagreement in a straightforward, tactful, nonargumentative manner. (4) Emphasize the importance of sticking together, in spite of these occasional disagreements. I could remind Hank that frustration and fighting might slow down our therapy at times, but this need not destroy the relationship or prevent our work from ultimately becoming fruitful.
