### Highlights

- William Sims Bainbridge and I have distinguished between sect movements an d cult movements (Stark and Bainbridge 19 79, 1985, 198 7). The former occur by schism within a conventional religious body when person s desiring a more otherworldly version of the faith break away to "restare " the religion to a higher leve l of tension with its environment. This is the process of sect formati o n analyzed by H. Richard Niebuhr (19 29). Sociologists can cite both theory and considerable research to show that those who take part in sect movements are , if not the dispos sessed, at least of lower social standing than those who stick with the parent body.

- Cult movements, on the other hand, are not simply new organizations of an o Id fai th ; they are new faiths, a t least new in the society being examined. Cult movements always start smallsomeone has new religious ideas an d begins to recruit others to the faith , or an alien re ligio n is imported into a society where i t then seeks recruits. In either case, as new fai ths, cult movements violate prevailing religiou:s norms and are often the target of con siderable hostili ty.

- The starting poìnt is to notìce that religìon can in fact compensate people for their ìnabilìty to gain certain things they desire . However, the ìnabilìty of humans to satisfy desire s has two quite dìfferent aspects. Fìrst, some people are unable to gain desìred rewards that are only scarce-rewards that others are able to obtain, or to obtaìn in more ampie amounts. These include the tangible rewards such as wealth and health , the lack of which underlìes ali deprivation ìnterpretatìons of relìgion. Clearly, relìgìons provide a varìety of effec tive mechanisms by which people can endure such deprìvations, includìng promises that earthly sacrifice will merit heavenly recompense ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLC6V5D9&location=529))
- But we must also recognize a second aspect of deprivatìon: the abìlity of re ligi o n to compensate people for desired rewards that seem to be absolutely unavailable to anyone, at least in tbis life. Tbe most obvious of these, and perbaps the one most intensely sougbt by bumans, is victory over death. No one, ricb or poor, can gaio eternai life by direct methods in the bere and now. Tbe only plausible source of sucb a reward is tbrougb religion , and tbe fulfillment of tbis promise is postponed to another world, a world known only througb religious means.

- Finally, we must recognize tbat as organized social enterprises, religions are a source of direct rewards to members. Tbat is, religious organizations reward some people with status, income, selfesteem, social relations, entertainment, and a bost of other things tbey value.

- Tbe second of these propositions captures the long tradition of deprivation tbeories of religion: that the poor will pray wbile tbe ricb play. W e may cali this the otherworldly or sectlike form of religious commitment. Tbe first proposition, on the other band, explains the relative absence of the lower classes from more conventional religious organizations, for it captures the religious expression of privilege. We can call tbis the worldly or cburcblike dimension of religious commitment. Tbe tbird proposition can be called tbe un iversal aspect of religious commitment, since it notes that in certain respects everyone is potentially deprived an d in need of the comforts of faith. It is tbis proposition tbat explains wby tbe upper classes are religious at ali, wby tbey too are susceptible to faith (something Marxist theories can only dismiss as aberration or as a phoney pose meant to lull the proletariat into false consciousness) . Moreaver, the third proposition helps explain why the more privilege d are drawn to cult movements. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLC6V5D9&location=543))

- although sociologists have long believed that people who give their religious affiliation as "none " are primarily secular humanists , considerable recent research shows this not to be the case. Most such people are merely indicating a lack of conviction in a conventionai brand of faith , far they are aiso the group rrwst likely to express interest in belief in unconventional mysticai, magica} , and religious doctrines. For example, "nones" are the group of Americans most willing to accept astrology, yoga, reincarnation, ghosts, and the like (Bainbridge and Stark 1980, 1981). Moreover, people who report their originai religious background as "none" are extremely overrepresented in the ranks of converts to new religious movements (Stark and Bainbridge 1985) .

- Studies of early adopters of cultura} innovations have long found them to be well above average in terms of incarne and education (Larsen 1962) . What is true of new technolo gy, fashions, and attitudes ought also to be true in the realm of faith . For new religions always involve new ideas. Consider citizens of the Roman world as they first confron ted the Pauline church . This was not simply a call to in tensify their commitment to a familiar faith (as sect movements always are) . Instead of calling Romans to return to the gods, Paul called them to embrace a new worldview, a new conception of reality, indeed to acce p t a new God. While sects are able to appeal to people of litùe in tellectual capacity by drumming the old, familiar culture , new religions fìnd such people diffìcult to reach . Thus they must gain their hearings from people of social standing and privilege ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLC6V5D9&location=567))
- That the less privileged become discontented when a religious organization becomes too worldly to continue to offe r them potent compensators far scarce rewards (proposition 2) is well known-this is the basis of sect movements. But there has been little awareness that sometimes a traditional faith and its organized expression can become so worldly that it cannot serve the universal need for religious compensators (proposition 3) . That is, religious bodies can become so empty of supernaturalism that they cannot serve the religious needs of the privileged either. At such moments, the privileged will seek new options. Indeed, it is the privileged w ho will be most aware of erosions of the plausibility structure of conventional faiths.

- Jesus seems to have been the leader of a sect movement within Judaism. Indeed, even in the immediate aftermath of the Crucifixion , there was li ttle to separate the disciples from their fe llow Jews . However, on the morning of the third day something happened that turned the Christian sect into a cult movement.
