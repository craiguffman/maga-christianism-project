### Highlights

- The biblical God is no longer the horizon of human life; the human is an autonomous individual now, able to determine for itself what it wants for itself and how to get it; the public square is consistently championed as a place where religious people should not bring their convictions; major moral decisions are made by reference to personal preference and sentiment; churches are seen to be the same thing as other “voluntary societies”; ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=46))
- the most surprising thing of all about early Christianity was the unique and utterly intense focus on a singular Jew, Jesus of Nazareth. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=71))
- At the heart of Christian discernment about this question and at the center of their surprise for the world was the revelation of the human as the image of Christ. ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=82))

- This vision of the human—one and all—was a Christian invention and put into the world a creature that the world had yet to see. Before the Christians no one had thought that every human—whether high, low, or anything in-between—was exactly the same as every other, and no one had thought that all of them were to be treated as if they were the very Lord of the world. In a very real sense, the Christians took the human as such, and therefore each and every instance thereof, to be the “incarnation” of Jesus Christ.

- The earliest Christians knew that to make the truth of Jesus and his image known to the world they had to do more than just announce its arrival. They needed to create ways of seeing and being that had not yet existed. So they established communities and institutions that took up space in public and made explicit through their order, structure, and practices what the human was in light of Christ. Over time the poor and the sick, for example, entered the world as new categories of people. The Roman world knew of poor people and sick people, of course, but it had never seen the “poor” as a distinct group of vulnerable people that required response, ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=91))
- The Christians, however, had learned through the story of everything that they were not to fear death, that they were to see Christ in the face of the poor and the sick, and that they were to be present to them and provide for them, come what may. The sharing of resources—first among other fellow Christians, and then beyond—nursing and doctoring during the plagues, the invention of the hospital and shelters for the poor. These were all Christian surprises for the world. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=96))
- Their point was not that there was nothing worth learning in the pagan world. Much to the contrary, their point was that to be in the world as they were called to be in the world they had to relate everything else to the truth elaborated in scripture. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=109))
- How can we be Christians? In light of our story, what reigning stories do we need to challenge? In light of our vision of the human, what do we need to be doing that’s not being done? In light of the need to learn and remember who we are, what do we need to teach, and what do we need to learn? ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=116))
- But it was also by teaching and showing what the human was that the story of everything was interpreted in real time/space for the world to see; and it was the human from the story of everything that the institutions most vividly depicted. Proclaiming Jesus as the crucified and risen Lord of the world, saying no to the emperor and gods, nursing the plague-ridden and founding an orphanage, teaching and interpreting scripture, setting up offices of bishop and deacon—all these things, and more, were not so much individual works of early Christianity as they were the single creative work that was required by integrated ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=121))
- Such complexity means that what it is to be Christian in the West is up for grabs. It is “up for grabs” because our present moment is so confusing, so misleading, and so promising all at once. Christianity will always be intertwined with the cultures in which it comes to exist; there is no such thing as uninculturated Christianity. But our current inculturation teaches us by habit and media exposure to think we have seen genuine Christianity on constant display, when in fact what we often see are only its various extremes or distortions. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=146))
- When you think about it, it is a rather strange thing that we wonder what it is to be human. No other animal in all creation wonders what it is to be itself. A dog simply lives its life as a dog, doing whatever doggy things dogs do—and that’s it. We live wondering who and what we are. The mere fact itself suggests that we do not instinctively know the answer. Were it apparent to us, we would not need to wonder. No search would be needed, no thought required. We would just know what it is to be human. But, instead, at whatever moment the human animal first experienced self-consciousness, we became mysteries to ourselves. And we have been reflecting on the human mystery—our self-mystery—ever since. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=563))

- The story of everything tells us that our humanity is not something we can know simply by pursuing it, whether by philosophical reflection or scientific experiment or anything else. We can learn some important things, of course, but we cannot get the answer we seek, and we remain hidden from ourselves even in our self-pursuit. We are mysteries because we cannot help being so after the fall and until we are given the story that tells us who and what we are. Who and what we are, that is, must be revealed to us from beyond what we can ourselves come up with. In other words, humanity’s self-understanding is a gift.

- This “know who and what you are only by a gift” runs profoundly afoul of many strong contemporary narratives about human identity, in which we are told that we make our own stories about who we are. The story we believe is that we create our stories. We discover who we feel like we want to be, and we write our lives accordingly. “We” are the stories we write about ourselves—our desires, our relationships, our interests, our dreams, our victimization, our success . . . and on it goes. The story of everything, by contrast, tells us that our humanity is something given and has its origins and clarity not in what we take ourselves to be but in the way we were created and redeemed. Who and what we are, to put the point the other way around, requires telling the story of everything as our story.

- The most original and startling part of the early Christian view of the human is this: Jesus of Nazareth is the human. All other humans are his image. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=585))

- For ancient Jewish interpreters of Genesis, however, the scripture was not broken into diachronically unrelated parts but taken more as the unfolding of a complicated story. In short, according to the narrative logic of the Bible, Adam led to Israel. The Imago was, in a critical sense, uniquely and historically concentrated in the people who carried it forward in time. Contrary to what one might initially imagine, the New Testament does not contradict this Jewish interpretation. Instead, it dramatically intensifies the notion that the Jewish elect bear God’s image by focusing this image-bearing entirely on one Jew.

- The total history of God’s image, that is, has been aimed at this: God images himself fully and completely in Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus is the Imago Dei. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=612))

- Thus is Jesus also the New Adam. As Luke and Paul thought, for example, to be God’s image is to relive the creation depicted in Genesis 1:26-27 (Luke 3–4; Rom 5). In contradistinction to the Gospel of Matthew, for example, which traces Jesus’s genealogy forward from Abraham through David to demonstrate Jesus’s Jewish messianic credentials, the Gospel of Luke moves backward, from Jesus through David to Moses to Abraham to Seth to Adam, who was “the son of God.” Luke’s genealogy reaches back before the election of Israel and the division into Jew and Gentile to the original human, God’s son, the one whom God made in his image. By means of this genealogical tracing, the story juxtaposes Jesus the Son of God and Adam the son of God. The point is not hard to discern: the Son of God has returned. Adam is figured in Jesus.

- As the son of God once moved from advent to temptation, so the Son of God once again moves from advent to temptation. As the human son of God once carried the history of the human in his act, so the human Son of God once again carries the history of the human in his act. “If you are the Son of God . . .” the Devil begins, echoing loudly the question of obedience and decision that permeates the Genesis account (Luke 4:3). Jesus’s subsequent resistance of the Devil, parrying of his moves, and resultant victory over him is, according to Luke’s narrative, a new creation—the human redone, its possibilities renewed, its requirements amplified, and its true identity (re)disclosed. For the Gospel of Luke, as for Paul, the Adam—the human—is Jesus the Lord, the Son of God. As the story moves on and even into Acts, the Lord Jesus carries forward in his person what the human is, and thus reconfigures the understanding of humanity as that which exhibits the image of Adam-Christ.

- The early Christian interpretation of the Genesis Imago text differed, therefore, from the typical non-Christian Jewish reading by going back to Adam to think through the implications of Jesus as the image of God. Biblical history did have a line of development, but this development moved not only from Adam to Israel but also from Israel to Adam. Which is to say that the early Christians worked with a complicated notion of time in which history was, as the church fathers would say with an all-important word, recapitulated.1 They read forward but also backward: Adam the image led to Israel the image which led to Adam the image again. The Adam, that is, was the image of Jesus Christ all along, the one who had now come in time as Adam returned. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=628))

- Since for the earliest Christians the image of God was not generic but specific and personal—Jesus Christ—the human beings that are in God’s image are in God’s image precisely because they are in the image of Jesus.

- The earliest Christians, however, began with Jesus and said that whenever you encounter a human being you simultaneously encounter him. Such particularizing had never before appeared in history. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=642))

- The logic was uncomplicated but profound and its implications staggering: because Jesus Christ is the human, every human is Jesus Christ. Historically considered, this was nothing less than a novum in the conception of humanity as such. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=649))

- Inasmuch as he relates to all creation as the one through whom all creation came to be, all humans who exist are in his image. Baptism effects outwardly and publicly what is true of the human in Christ. As Paul famously—and startlingly—put it to the baptized Christians in the churches of Galatia: “there is neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor free, male and female; for you all are one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28). Though many today read this verse as underwriting specific causes of various kinds, its real thrust is much deeper: in the face of all divisions of humanity past and present into greater and lesser or more and less human, Galatians echoes Genesis 1 to say once again that there really is no human difference in Christ.

- Jesus himself began the work of this envisioning. He knew that our inability to see the human on the other side of our inherited and well-maintained lines of division was severe and could not simply be lectured away.

- the lawyer to draw the conclusion that the victim is his neighbor—that he may well already assume—but that the Samaritan is his neighbor. The lawyer, however, cannot quite bring himself to say “Samaritan,” though he obviously knows the answer. He says instead, “the one who showed him mercy.” This answer dismantles and rebuilds the categories the lawyer employs when thinking of the meaning of neighbor and works on the level of affect to draw the circle of neighbor as wide as it can get. By the end of the parable the lawyer now has to include the repugnant Samaritan when he gives the answer to his own question, Who is my neighbor? The force of the parable, therefore, is not a simple “be good like the unlikely character the Samaritan” but “Samaritans are your neighbors. Show them mercy.” This, one might say, is a parabolic rendition of Adam/Christ theology. No one is “not-neighbor.” ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=684))

- Such a vision of the human entailed a posture, an ethic, a way of being in the world with other humans whom you knew to be Christ. Again, it was Jesus himself who initiated the church’s human ethic. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=693))

- The parable requires a much more specific anthropological understanding than a simple “representation,” namely, the poor, destitute, and imprisoned represent something more than their mere appearance would initially suggest. The king speaks of a closeness of kinship that means the lowly are so much the king’s family that when they are encountered, the king himself is encountered. In short, they bear his image. When one encounters the lowly, therefore, one sees the image of the king, and they are to be treated as one would treat the king. The lowly, as it turns out, are nothing less than kingly. Which is to say that the lowly are the image of Jesus, who is obviously the king. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=708))

- They knew from the story of everything that the human that is Christ’s image exists in a world that is not yet fully redeemed and that we actively participate in this “not yet.” ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085LQFWD1&location=730))

- The entirety of the Corinthian correspondence, for example, is painful testimony to residual patterns of the old Adam in the life of the early Christians. They fight, they divide, they act immorally, they return to pagan festivals, they mistreat the poor at the Lord’s Supper, they accuse Paul of weakness, they glory in themselves, and much more besides.

- If, as Charles Taylor has persuasively argued, the absence of the belief in the possibility of human transformation—a fundamental remaking of a human life-trajectory in light of transcendent goods—is one of the defining marks of our current age, then our age’s prevailing view is exactly opposite of the early Christians. They knew of and endorsed many earthly goods (marriage, children, friendship, etc.), of course, but their view of the human is transformational through and through.
