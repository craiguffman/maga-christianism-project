- conscious attempt on Luke’s part to vivify the memory of Socrates’ trial in the minds of his auditors and forge a connection to the Athenian reputation for enforcing the death penalty upon those who brought in new gods.119 Once awakened, the memory of Socrates’ trial reverberates with the text of Acts to create an analogy between Paul’s situation and that of Socrates. The reader is therewith enjoined to discern in Paul’s arraignment the potential for death.120 Like Socrates, Paul is charged by the governing Athenian council with introducing strange, new deities (Jesus and Resurrection),121 and, like Socrates, Paul’s life may be forfeited.122 ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=813))

- Through his careful use of ξνοι and καιντερον Luke creates a sense of irony in which the attentive reader can recognize Athenian hypocrisy: the council is prepared to threaten Paul with the charge of bringing in καιν/ξνα δαιμνια, but it is the Athenians themselves who admit ξνοι into their city and together with them spend time telling and hearing something καιντερον.

- A careful reading of vv. 16–21 thus creates a distinct Vorverständnis with which the reader then hears Paul’s speech. Instead of a romantic view of Athens as the place of university-like debate, Luke portrays the city’s rampant idolatry—Paul is rightly vexed—as the context in which the Christian preaching of the resurrection of Jesus (1) is distorted and (2) results in a potentially life-threatening situation for Paul vis-à-vis the political authorities (who are themselves enmeshed in hypocrisy).

- In fact, however, these two different readings of δεισιδαμων are but different sides of the same coin. As Hans-Josef Klauck notes,133 Luke actually exploits the ambiguity of δεισιδαιμονστερος. The characters of the story, that is, hear δεισιδαιμονστερος in a complimentary sense, while the auditors— remembering the perspective created by 17:16—hear Luke’s critique of Athenian idolatry as superstition. Δεισιδαιμονστερος is simultaneously very “religious” and “superstitious.” To eliminate the ambiguity of δεισιδαιμονστερος, therefore, is to eliminate the dramatic irony and the sophisticated manner in which this technique negotiates between the author’s historical presentation and the reader’s contemporary situation.134 By contrast, to discern the dramatic irony in the first sentence of Paul’s address is to become alert to the subtlety and richness of the multilevel discourse of the speech.

- In light of the Socratic resonance—the specific accusation of bringing in new, strange gods—it is not surprising that Luke narrates Paul’s first theological move as one that attempts to deflect the charge of newness: “what therefore you worship unknowing, this I proclaim to you” (). Paul’s proclamation is not new, for his message in Athens is preceded there by the reality that evokes it. Indeed, Paul specifies this unknown god as “the God who made the world and ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=870))

- To link the identity of the unknown god with creation is to undermine in the most radical way possible the charge of preaching a new divinity. Bluntly put, it can scarcely get older than this: the God about whom Paul speaks created the world in which Athens exists.

- By Luke’s time such criticism was a philosophical commonplace, particularly among Stoics. Seneca, for example, strove time and again to purify crassly material notions of divinity by sundering their tie to the practices of caring for images: “Let us forbid lamps to be lighted on the sabbath, since gods do not need light…. God is worshipped by those who truly know him. Let us forbid bringing towels and flesh-scrapers to Jupiter, and proffering mirrors to Juno; for God seeks no servants. Of course not.”140 And Lucian knew, as well as any Stoic, that Apollo needed no precious metals for his honor: “the god takes no interest in your gold-work,” says Solon to Croesus (Charon, 12).141 At least for the more sophisticated, “the anthropomorphism of Greek cult statues does not mean that the Greeks thought their gods actually were people” that required cleansing, food (i.e., sacrifices), and care.142 ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=889))

- Political emissaries brought images with them for assistance or had them shipped.150 Travelers carried statuettes on their journeys.151 Statues worked miracles, cured diseases, changed expressions, or less positively, were buried, flogged, chained, banished, defamed, lusted after, and so on.152 In short, despite traditions of critical reflection, the practice of viewing “shrines made by human hands” as habitations of divine figures was an essential component of the larger pagan construal of reality.

- Much to the contrary, the similarity points to a fundamentally important part of Luke’s narrative project vis-à-vis gentile converts: to break the connection between God and the world that underwrites pagan religion. Luke’s advocacy for this rupture, however, depends ultimately not on philosophically superior notions of τ θεον (17:29) but upon a biblically funded doctrine of θες as the transcendent Creator of the cosmos (Isa 42:5: ). To hear clearly παροξνομαι and κατεδωλος in Acts 17:16 is to understand 17:24–25 at the narrative theological level not so much as philosophical critique as a skillfully articulated charge of idolatry.

- God’s purpose in creating all (πν νος νθρπων) from one (ξ νς)154 was so that they might seek, even grope, after God and find him (17:26–27).155 The ground for this seeking and finding is, for Luke, ultimately biblical: “You will seek the Lord your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deut 4:29; cf. Isa 55:6, etc.). But here he presents only the linguistic “point of contact” with pagan thinking, as he moves Paul—once again the rhetor—through a series of allusions to and citations of gentile philosophy and poetry.156 ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=936))

- Though in 17:28b Luke writes , interpreters since Clement of Alexandria (Stromateis, 1.19) have recognized the ensuing statement (17:28c) as a citation of Aratus’s Phaenomena, an immediately and immensely popular work translated into Latin (by Cicero, among others) and even Arabic. The opening of the work is a proem to Zeus in which Aratus writes (Phaen., 5).160 Yet, as Douglas Kidd and others have suggested,161 Aratus himself may have had in mind Cleanthes’ famous hymn to Zeus, in which it is also said: “We are your offspring, ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=964))

- Even the Jewish philosopher Aristobulus cites the opening lines of the Phaenomena, though Aristobulus’s primary point in so doing is theological in a strict sense: to posit an ultimate metaphysical identity between the high god of the pagans (Zeus) and the high god of the Jews (God of Israel).165 ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=979))

- Whereas Aristobulus uses the Aratus text to point to the sameness of divine reality, Luke employs it to criticize the basic theological error in pagan idolatry, namely, that because human beings are the “offspring” of divinity, they can image God in their form. On Luke’s construal, in other words, the pagan error is named as an error of direction: it assumes that the correspondence implied in the divine-human relation (offspring) allows humans to read “god” (τ θεον) off the face of their humanity. To the contrary, says Luke, precisely because we are the (living) offspring of (the living) God, we cannot image him.166 The human arts and faculties are prone to ignorance (γνοια) and superstition (δεισιδαιμονα) with the result that God comes to be conceived as like gold, silver, or stone—in short, a representation by human technical skill and imaginative power (17:29).

- “From nature the Greeks have evolved not natural theology but natural idolatry.”167 Luke thus turns the wisdom of Aratus on its head: humanity’s divine origin excludes “visual theology.” ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=991))

- In vv. 26–29, therefore, Luke incorporates aspects of gentile poetic expression and philosophical theology into the overall theological direction of the opening chapters of Genesis, from God toward humanity. By so doing Luke is able both to affirm the worth of pagan insight (we are God’s offspring and do live, move, and have our being in God) and to turn it critically back upon pagan practice (we therefore cannot image God because we cannot refract the notion of divinity through our humanity).

- At this point, the radical particularity of the Christian message erupts from the universalizing scope of Paul’s speech heretofore:170 there is a particular man (νρ) upon whom and a particular day (μρα) upon which the relation of God to the entirety of the world depends.171 Moreover, the theological intensity of this focus has been given public demonstration—πστιν… πσιν—in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.172 Indeed, it is this particular event that effected the decisive change in the human situation indicated by τ νν. Luke’s move in 17:30–31 thus entails a total determination of general cosmology by a radically particularized eschatology. Whether one’s interpretive structure was Platonist, Aristotelian, Epicurean, Stoic, or something else (e.g., everyday paganism), to accept Luke’s construal of the importance of Jesus’s resurrection for the world would mean the destruction of one’s theory(ies)—tacit or acknowledged—of the origin and (non-)end of the cosmos. It is therefore hardly surprising that some sneered (λευζω) at Paul after hearing of the resurrection (v. 32).

- Whether one reads 17:32b as a statement that stems from aroused curiosity or as the decision on the part of some members of the Areopagus to postpone a verdict until the arrival of further clarification, the fact remains that Paul has given a speech that protects him from the charge of “newness”— through his effective use of the ’Aγνστ θε inscription, citation of Aratus, and allusions to widespread and established philosophical positions174—and simultaneously confronts the leading council in Athens with the proclamation of Jesus’s resurrection and the truth of their coming judgment. At this point at least, Paul carefully manages to avoid the death penalty without compromising his call to bear witness to the risen Jesus before gentile authorities (cf. Acts 9:15).

- In point of fact, Luke constructs the scene in Athens such that the conversation with pagan philosophy takes place within two parentheses, as it were, that encompass the totality of human life: creation (17:24, 26) and consummation (17:30–31). By thus shifting the larger terms of the conversation, Luke renders hermeneutically ineffective the original intellectual structures that determined philosophically the meaning of the pagan phrases. In the Areopagus speech the line from Aratus’s Phaenomena and other allusions are removed from their original interpretive frameworks and embedded within a different framework, one that stretches from Gen 1 through the resurrection of Jesus to the last day (μρα, v. 31).

- This essential shift in meaning is why it is ultimately incorrect to say that in Athens Luke is translating the gospel into pagan philosophical terms.178 Rather than positing conceptual equivalence between the former and the latter—the sine qua non for “same-saying” or translation179—the Areopagus discourse articulates a rival conceptual scheme. For Luke, pagan philosophy is not Christian discourse in a different language.180 Thus, to be “God’s offspring” in Luke’s sense is not to be the children of Zeus who can read the signs in the stars (Aratus) but is inherently to be a people that reject pagan religious practice as idolatry. To know with Luke that the God who might be sought is not far is not to affirm the worth of natural theology but to know that God has not been found. To embrace on Luke’s terms that God does not live in shrines built by human hands is not to rebuke philosophically the simple-minded pagan practitioner but is to admit to the problem of gentile ignorance in toto and the need for repentance; it is hence to admit to the δικαιοσνη of the God of the Jews (v. 31) and to locate the decisive event of human history in the resurrection of Jesus. To agree with the logic of the Areopagus speech in the end, therefore, is not to see the truth of the gospel in pagan philosophical terms (translation) but to abandon the old interpretive framework for the new. It is, plainly said, to become a Christian. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=1042))

- Thus, while Paul can avoid the specific accusation of newness, his speech is nevertheless politically charged in that it does in fact entail a call to embrace a new way of life and abandon pagan worship (cf. μετνοια, v. 30). Indeed, the same inscription upon which Paul initially grounded his defense (’Aγνστ θε) provides, by the end of the speech, a critique of the pagan religious habitus as ignorant idolatry. That the call to conversion inherent in the Christian critique was—at the very least—socially and politically dangerous emerges clearly once again in the episode in Ephesus, to ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=1054))

- That such a christological expansion of the identity of God does not, in the Acts of the Apostles, threaten the God of Israel is at once confirmed by taking notice of the actual speaker of the Joel text.

- But in Luke’s way of thinking, κριος πντων is who “Jesus” is: Jesus is completely inseparable from his identity as the universal Lord.112 Caesar’s rivalry thus takes the form of wrongful (self-) exaltation to the sphere whose existence is exactly concomitant with the identity of God in Jesus Christ. Politics, that is, inevitably involves the question of idolatry.113 From the perspective of the Graeco-Roman world, therefore, things are indeed upside down: Jesus’s lordship is primary— ontologically and, hence, politically—not Caesar’s.

- In Luke’s vision, the practical corollary of the primacy of God in Jesus Christ is, to employ contemporary language, the primacy of peace and service.114 Where the lordship of the Roman emperor entailed a pax predicated upon pacifying strength and terror, the lordship of Jesus, so Luke believed, produced a revaluation of the world’s sense of pax. If the Caesars could be called “peacemaker,”115 it was not without the realization that their form of peace was tied to a still deeper possibility of military violence.

- By stark contrast, in Luke and Acts, pax (ερνη) is interpreted christologically, which is to say through the lens that is the life of Jesus of Nazareth. In the heart of the passage that initiated our discussion in this section—indeed, in the very sentence that leads to the κριος πντων confession—Luke summarizes the gospel as the preaching of peace through Jesus Christ: “You know the word which he sent to the people of Israel preaching peace through Jesus Christ” (10:36).

- for Luke pax is christologically shaped but also its converse, namely, that peace is the major practical category by which Luke interprets the life of Jesus: “In the Lukan writings … the word ‘peace’ comes close to becoming a theological term that captures the whole meaning of the Christ event.”118 The summary in 10:36, therefore, renders the “whole story of Jesus … a declaration of peace.” ([Location 2864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005RBU8U4&location=2864))

- the pax Romana were the only object of Luke’s gaze—but as part of a larger conceptual field in which the Lordship of God through Jesus Christ determines theologically the practical outworking of life.

- For Luke as for Rome, to be the Lord of all is to be the “peacemaker.” But the respective ways in which they construe this role could hardly be more different. For Luke and not for Rome, the pax of the dominus mundi is the kind of humble service that accepts its own suffering and death. The particular challenge entailed in the Roman emperor’s claim to be the κριος πντων thus turns out to take the form of a violent refusal of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, the primacy of peace that is manifested in the willingness to serve God rather than humans through trial, suffering, and death.

- That learning to confess Jesus as the κριος πντων in the way that his life demands was good practical training in suffering and death for the community that Acts seeks to form is evidenced not only in the way Luke’s character “Paul” paradigmatically faces his own suffering,123 trial, and impending death but also elsewhere in the NT and in the earliest examples of persecution against the Christians in the second century.

- Precisely in learning to see Jesus Christ as the expression of the universal Lordship of the God of Israel were the Christians made ready to live the distinction drawn in Acts—in the contrasting speech of Peter and Festus— between Jesus and the Roman emperor. Where the demand would later come to worship and confess Caesar as κριος under the threat of torture and death, those schooled by the narrative of Acts could detect the false claim of a usurper and the violent challenge to the basic priority of peace and service.
