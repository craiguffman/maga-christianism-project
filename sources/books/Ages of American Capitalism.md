### Highlights

- To write this book, I have learned and drawn from a tradition of thought in economics, sustained in the twentieth century by such thinkers as John Maynard Keynes, Thorstein Veblen, Joseph Schumpeter, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, and Albert Hirschman. I have also drawn from the pre-twentieth-century, so-called classical political economists that many of them engaged with, above all Adam Smith but also Karl Marx. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=99))
- I would argue for the rightful place of historical analysis in economics, and for a broader vision of what the economy is. Dormant traditions in economic thought once argued for this position. Seeking to revive them, I have tried to recut a wider path in order to make room for the inclusion of many subjects—spanning, say, politics and society, or environment and psyche—that once were but today are not typically seen as relevant to understanding the economy in which we live. My conviction is that these subjects and many others are relevant. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=109))
- A history of the U.S. economy must encompass a great deal: demographic trends, trade patterns, growth rates, energy regimes, incentives, and productivity measurements. But it must also encompass Thomas Jefferson’s disdain for the English. Henry David Thoreau’s moral critique of commerce, and Herman Melville’s response. The corruptions of the Lincoln administration. Labor violence. FDR’s jokes. The persistence of white supremacy. The twentieth-century architecture of shopping malls. Second-wave feminists’ critique of marriage. The erotic quality of much stock market speculation. Reagan’s optimism about markets. Obama’s ambivalence about bankers.

- Before setting out, I would like to briefly introduce the economic vision that informs this book, its core concepts and themes, and the three overarching arguments about capitalism and its history in America that run through it. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=127))
- At the center of my understanding of capitalism, commonsensically enough, is capital. In my view, it is the centrality of capital to this form of economic life that makes the use of capitalism both necessary and illuminating. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=131))
- Thesis #1: Rather than a physical factor of production, a thing, capital is a process. Specifically, capital is the process through which a legal asset is invested with pecuniary value, in light of its capacity to yield a future pecuniary profit. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=141))
- Capital is no inert thing, with an intrinsic value. The value of a capital investment, being in the flow of historical events, is always uncertain. Human agents, acting in concert, must capitalize, or instill pecuniary value in, an object.3 Through investment and disinvestment, they create and destroy assets. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=147))
- A capitalist economy is one in which economic life is broadly geared around the habitual future expectation that capital assets will earn for their owners a pecuniary reward above their cost. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=151))
- My position is that investment, the first mover, is the best perspective from which to watch capitalism at work. Without it, there simply cannot be wealth-generating labor and production, the market exchange of goods, and, what is ultimately the point of economic life, consumption. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=154))
- this definition of capital has a number of key dimensions. They are: the significance of money, credit, and finance; the essential role of expectations; the need for capital assets to have a scarcity value; and the distinction between capital and income. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=156))
- But a factor of production is only one form that capital may take. A financial asset—a stock or bond, say—might simply appreciate in markets and thus yield a money income for its owners. As Keynes once put it, “It is much preferable to speak of capital as having a yield over the course of its life in excess of its original cost, than as being productive.” ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=163))
- Capital is a process of valuation, in which assets are expected to yield future pecuniary profits. That process might depend on labor and the production of wealth. But by not restricting capital to a factor of production, our working definition of capital is capacious enough to encompass money, credit, and finance as critical cogs in a capitalist economy. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=166))
- What makes an asset a capital asset is the prospective yield attached to it. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=170))
- As the American economist Irving Fisher long ago explained in his The Nature of Capital and Income (1906), with capital assets, “when values are considered, the causal relation is not from present to the future, but from future to present.”7 In the capitalist epoch, in addition to the heritage of the past, expectations of the future—unlike the past, always an uncertain business—determine the economic present to a remarkable degree. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=172))
- The present in a capitalist economy is thus determined by a mixture of past expectations, still working themselves out through actions, and present expectations that relate future horizons, of various durations, back to the present. If expectations rule, then individual and collective psychological projections of the future play a dynamic role in a capitalist economy. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=178))
- Capital assets must have a scarcity value. The legal ownership and control of capital assets cannot be free and open to all. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=182))
- The owners of capital control investment decisions. More than anything, the investment power is what makes capitalists so powerful. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=186))
- There are many ways to engineer and maintain the scarcity value of a capital asset. Land, say, may be ring-fenced. Law, for instance, especially property law, has been a foremost method.9 In its primal money form, the scarcity value of capital is much determined by the rate of interest. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=187))
- All else being equal, the less capital there is, the more one can get with it—if one has it. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=195))
- The value of a capital asset relates to its prospective pecuniary income. But the asset must be distinguished from its yield—capital from income. The distinction matters in tracing out important economic shifts. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=197))
- The United States was born with a political economy anchored in the widespread distribution of productive capital among white men—chiefly landed property but also enslaved black people. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=199))
- During the course of the industrial revolution, a higher concentration of private capital ownership among relatively fewer capitalists came about. And U.S. politics shifted toward a new focal point, toward the distribution not of capital but of the income yielded from capital. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=200))
- After the New Deal, during the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, what I call “income politics” has predominated, whether it has taken the form, variously, of income taxation, labor union collective bargaining, nonprofit philanthropy, or redistributive welfare policies. Thus the capital-income distinction offers a vantage point from which to understand the relationship between politics and economics under capitalism, especially as it relates to issues of equality and inequality. One of the fundamental arguments of the book will concern the distinction between “income politics” and a politics of capital. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=202))
- one common misconception is that capital is only a factor of production, then another is the belief in the purely rational psychology of all economic agents, including capitalists. Here the general picture is of capitalists who, like great calculating machines, are always sufficiently motivated to rationally invest their capital in pursuit of the highest possible pecuniary return, or profit. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=208))
- the profit motive of capitalists has never been enough to drive economic history, not even the history of capitalism. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=214))
- the working assumption that even the greatest capitalists of all time have always been purely rationally motivated to maximize their profits at all costs and against all other considerations simply does not hold up on historical scrutiny. The ideological belief that a capitalist economy is governed by a rational economic calculus intrinsic to our natures and dedicated to the pursuit of moneymaking is so deep-seated in our culture that it can be difficult to shake. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=220))
- This is something of a paradox. The pull of profit expectations on economic life defines capitalism. However, the participants in a capitalist economy must be motivated to pursue its end—profit—by something other than that end. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=225))
- slave owners were entrepreneurial capitalists who eyed their bottom lines, even as they were motivated by, among other things, their quest for racial domination. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=229))
- capital’s quest for pecuniary gain has always been complicated by a great variety of rational and irrational human motivations—sometimes energized by them and sometimes, as we shall see, enervated. Though it exists, the profit motive has always been entangled in complicated ways with larger individual and collective projects. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=243))
- what separates the ages of American capitalism, I will argue, are not strictly economic variables but rather political initiatives: the British Empire’s mercantilist project of the 1660s, as it transformed its fledgling North American colonies; the electoral triumph of the antislavery Republican Party in 1860s, and the secession of southern slave states; the New Deal of the 1930s, responding to the Great Depression; and the beginning of the Volcker interest rate shock of 1979, followed by the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=245))
- The heart of the subject is this: dynamic amalgams, contradictory drives, and productive tensions account for the swirling motivations and factors, economic and not, that make for a capitalist economy at work. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=259))
- Capitalism is an economy—an instrumental means of producing things for consumption—geared toward the achievement of capital’s end, which is pecuniary gain. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=261))
- Economic growth, an increase in the value of production per head over time, is one of capitalism’s distinguishing characteristics, and high rates of growth have long distinguished the American economy from others. But capitalist development has always been punctuated by repeating cycles of boom and bust. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=277))
- The emergence of capitalism must, in part, be explained by an historical oddity: the appearance of a new ability and willingness to invest that kick-started new kinds of wealth-generating labor and production. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=286))
- Thesis #3: The history of capitalism is a never-ending conflict between the short-term propensity to hoard and the long-term ability and inducement to invest. This conflict holds the key to explaining many of the dynamics of capitalism over time, including its periods of long-term economic development and growth, and its repeating booms and busts. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=289))
- The gist of thesis three was first suggested—only dashed off, really—by Keynes during the Great Depression. Buried in a paragraph near the end of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), Keynes speculated: There has been a chronic tendency throughout human history for the propensity to save to be stronger than the inducement to invest. The weakness of the inducement to invest has been at all times the key to the economic problem.14 ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=296))
- The reason the inducement to invest for the long term is weak, Keynes argued, is that the short-term “liquidity preference” of the owners of capital is usually stronger. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=302))
- Liquidity is a relative quality of a commodity, including a subset of commodities—capital assets. First and foremost, a liquid asset is one that maintains its value over time.17 For its owner, it acts as a safe warehouse of value, and thus a store of wealth—a lull from disquietude. For much of history, money was a hard metal, like gold, that stabilized its value due to its lack of physical deterioration. When money enjoys a stable value over time, it thus acquires one attribute of liquidity. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=306))
- a second attribute defines liquidity. Another reason money is typically a relatively liquid asset—in a well-functioning capitalist economy, the most liquid—is that there is always a ready buyer for it. In fact, one of money’s functions is to be a means of transaction; money can readily be traded.18 For this reason, in capitalist economies money is also a means of speculation, the rapid conversion of capital in and out of assets in pursuit of short-term pecuniary gain. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=311))
- A liquid asset thus offers its owner a precautionary lull from disquietude but also an energetic means of speculation, of rapid investment and disinvestment. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=315))
- Finally, there is the preference for “precautionary” liquidity: an owner of wealth chooses to store value over time, seeking the psychic return of security, perhaps even at the expense of pecuniary profit. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=325))
- the final link in this chain concerns the relationship between liquidity, in all its guises, and long-term investment. Money may serve as a means of transaction and a store of wealth. But money does not produce anything. If money is typically the most liquid good, then the purchase of relatively illiquid factors of production—money as a means of long-term investment—leads to the great leaps forward in wealth-generating enterprise and production. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=329))
- Liquidity and illiquidity are relative qualities, which must get attributed by actors to capital assets. They are not essential properties of them. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=348))
- For centuries of U.S. history, an enslaved black person was relatively liquid—more easily convertible, in southern capital markets, than land, and a chosen store of value. Back then landed property could have been relatively more liquid. It was just that the slave economy of the South was not institutionally, legally, or psychologically organized that way by its rulers. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=350))
- much more recently, before 2007, another appreciating asset, the “mortgage-backed security,” was considered by the largest banks that traded them to be very liquid—nearly as liquid as cash—until, due to rising home mortgage defaults, its value was questioned. Suddenly confidence collapsed, and they and nearly all other assets somehow tied to them became not tradable at all—illiquid. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=354))
- For a capitalist economy to function, some asset or another must enjoy the attributes of liquidity. Capitalist economies need a relatively liquid asset as a psychological anchor. If it is not money it will be something else. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=358))
- In sum, liquidity preference ties all three theses of the book together. It opens up to analysis the variety of factors at stake in the capital process that drive production but cannot be reduced to the productivity of capital; the liquidity of assets makes possible irrational forms of speculation and precaution that undermine any operative notion of a purely rational profit motive always at work behind economic processes; liquidity enables productive booms and enervating slumps. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=365))
- Arguably, there is no more extraordinary instance of economic development on record than the case of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century United States. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=383))
- But with higher money incomes, the possibility of investment-undermining speculation and precaution appeared. Paradoxically, the higher money incomes were, the greater the risk that money could enable investment-undermining liquidity preference. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=386))
- During the 1920s the industrial revolution culminated with the arrival of electric-powered Fordist mass production, the greatest leap forward in productive capacity in world history. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=387))
- During the 1930s, New Deal liberalism sought to control capital, by regulating it but also by inducing private investment in employment-giving production. Doing so, New Deal policies still shifted income away from capital and toward labor. But now a new reason to hoard emerged—capitalists’ objections to political interventions in their investment power. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=391))
- A new kind of liquidity preference came into shape, in addition to the speculative and precautionary—what I will refer to as “political” liquidity preference, as the owners of capital threatened to not invest long term unless their political demands were met. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=393))
- during World War II, the state finally intervened and, through the fiscal multiplier of public investment in military production, ended the Great Depression. The United States ascended to hegemonic position in the world economy. The postwar period saw a private corporate investment boom in industry, the rise of consumerism, and the attempt of Cold War liberalism to stabilize the U.S. domestic and world economies. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=396))
- But Cold War liberalism failed, and industrial society perished. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=399))
- A new age opened after 1980, examined in Book Four, “The Age of Chaos.” Since then, I argue, there has been a relative shift to a capitalism defined by a very high speculative liquidity preference. Capital left fixed physical structures, to become more financial, intangible, leveraged, roving, and unsettled. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=399))
- I call this the capitalism of asset price appreciation, which directs the bulk of fresh income gains not to labor earnings, or pay, but to the owners of capital, whether the era’s financial capital, “human capital,” or “social capital.” ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=402))
- This capitalism, which has so exacerbated inequality, has been fueled by the return of the capitalist credit cycle and speculative investment booms that, by historical standards, are very speculative indeed. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=403))
- Thus the propensity to hoard has triumphed again in our own times. The weakness of investment—in terms of quality and quantity—is the key economic problem. If there is one argument, quite prominent over the past decades, that this book argues against, it is that the free mobility of capital will accord with any rational or intelligent design when left to its own devices—that private investment will result in the greatest fulfillment of economic potential, with an allocation of goods that is reasonable, optimal, and just. I object to this argument. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=410))
- History does not confirm the belief in the existence of some economic mechanism through which the pattern of capital investment will simply lead to the best possible outcome so long as it is not interfered with. One likely outcome, among others, is that the propensity to hoard will win out, exacerbating inequality and crippling economic possibilities. As the profit motive is not enough, a high inducement to investment must come from somewhere outside the economic system, narrowly conceived. History shows that politics and collective action are usually where it comes from. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=415))
- The origins of American capitalism are to be found within the history of a particular political project that mixed varied impulses into a dynamic amalgam that created something new. The project was empire. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=428))
- American capitalism was first the result of the seventeenth-century English imperial effort to colonize the Caribbean and the Atlantic seaboard of the North American continent. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=430))
- Commerce, the exchange of one unlike thing for another, has existed for time out of mind. Capitalist commerce, or exchange in expectation of a pecuniary profit, is more specific and recent. It is characterized by forward-looking investment in the generation of gain through trade. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=434))
- Mercantilism was a variety of imperialism in which rulers considered foreign commerce to be a critical source of state wealth and power and therefore an “affair of state.” Mercantilist empires jostled and fought for a larger slice of the world’s commerce. The state and the market, public and private, were fundamentally entangled and mixed from inside one another. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=441))
- “Smithian growth,” or the cumulative process resulting from the interactions of commercial self-interest, the division of labor, and the extent of markets, helps explain long-term commercial development throughout this ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=447))
- Central to the process of Smithian growth, as it unfolded in early America, was the European enslavement of African and Afro-descendant people. Enslaved persons, as portable forms of productive capital, could be coerced against their will to move to places where they did not want to go, and to labor. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=451))
- Typically, each household consisted of a “head,” an adult man, who was the husband, father, and master. His dependents were his wife, children, servants, and slaves. Politically, the head of household was “independent,” vested with a civic status to participate in the polity, as well as to rule in the household—a subsovereign of the empire. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=464))
- In the end, a different long-term republican vision for U.S. political economy won out, the Virginian Thomas Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty. This settlement made a politics of property—widespread property ownership in land and slaves among white male heads of household—the anchor of U.S. political economy. To ensure that, it focused on the commercial and slave-based colonization of the agrarian West. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=477))
- The rise of democracy in America fueled a popular, near-populist rage over participation in commerce. An anti-elitist politics of equality of commercial opportunity was born. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=484))
- The subject of Chapter 5, “Confidence Games,” is the attempts by various figures—the showman P. T. Barnum, the transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, and the novelist Herman Melville—to make moral sense of the increasing place of commerce in everyday American life. The chapter also clarifies concepts crucial for making sense of the relationship between long-term economic development and the repeating capitalist credit cycle, throughout the ages. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=493))
- There it linked up with a new urban industrial society, where economic investment was shifting into the productive capital of the industrial revolution and where independence was defined by self-ownership, rather than by the ownership of land or slaves. Of equal importance, northern moral and affective investments were moving into the new breadwinner-homemaker family, different from the households of before. The breadwinner-homemaker family sphered not only private from public but also home from work—another stable tension, achieved through opposition rather than entanglement. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=509))
- What brought about the end of the Age of Commerce in America was precisely the issue that had initiated it—a geopolitical struggle over commerce, and over a particular kind. From the seventeenth century, enslaved capital had played a vital role in the extension of capitalist production across North American space. The free labor vision of the North now hoped to forbid its spread. The Republican Party, which arose during the national political crises of the 1850s over the extension of slavery in the West, desired a new political-economic settlement. No one was better at articulating the moral and economic reasons for it than the party’s candidate for president in the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln said slavery should exist only where it already stood and someday should die out altogether. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=517))
- Wealth is power, and power is wealth. The aphorism commonly attributed to the Englishman Thomas Hobbes, author of the great political philosophical treatise Leviathan (1651), was later invoked by Adam Smith in the greatest treatise ever written on commerce, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776).1 ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=528))
- Smith admired the commercial character of British North America, and today many consider him to be something like a patron saint of capitalism, as, supposedly, he was critical of all government intervention into “the market.”3 That was not so.4 Smith was a theorist of political economy, of the relationship between the ordering of power and the generation of wealth. He made no categorical separation between the political and the economic, or state and market. The question for him was their relationship and the consequences of their complicated overlap. The wealth of nations could be the result only of good policy making. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=538))
- Everyone may gain from trade. The wealth of nations grows. This is what economists today call “Smithian growth,” the combined and interactive result of self-interest, the division of labor, and the extent of markets. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=553))
- Foremost, mercantilists promoted an understanding of political economy in which there was no categorical separation between state and market. Smith inherited this legacy. But unlike Smith, mercantilists defined national economic prosperity as the existence of a positive “balance of trade” with other nations. Greater market access and more commerce were the sources of imperial wealth, but only when a nation exported goods of a value greater than it imported, including in relation to its colonies. More coin flowed into the nation’s coffers at the expense of its geopolitical competitors. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=563))
- Mercantilists took for granted a zero-sum global economy, occupied by warring states forever fighting over market access abroad.10 Not all nations could gain from trade, not all at once. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=568))
- After the English Civil War, the Restoration English state moved to incorporate its wayward early North American colonies into its expanding imperial, mercantilist orbit. As it did, mercantilism transformed, and American capitalism was born. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=572))
- The great pivot for British North American commercial development was the period after 1660, when Parliament restored Charles II to the British throne eleven years after the execution of his father in the English Civil War. Up until then, English colonization had been a haphazard affair, with early efforts leading to repeated failures—in terms of survival, let alone commercial gain. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=575))
- Shaftesbury was to be a leading figure in Restoration England. During the Civil War, he had played both sides, Crown and Parliament, before joining the victorious forces of Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell’s death, Shaftesbury then helped to restore Charles II to the throne. But he remained a vocal critic of royal absolutism, becoming a founder of the liberal-minded Whig Party. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=587))
- Like many Whigs, and unlike many of their Tory political opponents, Shaftesbury was among the more enterprising of English lords. He sought to “improve” his lands and thereby increase their productivity and commercial yields. In that process, land became something more than the property and wealth that sustained gentry class rule. It also became a form of productive capital. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=598))
- It is difficult to appreciate, after the fact, what a fantastical project the quest for an Atlantic empire was at the time when Shaftesbury and other gentleman imperial capitalists embarked on it. Nothing quite like it had ever happened before. Convention offered only so much guidance. Shaftesbury may have been better informed about America than any man in England, but a thick fog of uncertainty remained.18 At a minimum, any oceangoing commercial venture or empire-building endeavor took months, if not years, even to attempt to execute. No one, including Shaftesbury, could reasonably have expected fulfillment of the Atlantic imperial project within a single lifespan.

- power, he formed a like-minded circle around him. In 1666, then chancellor of the exchequer, Shaftesbury traveled to Oxford suffering from a liver ailment. A young physician installed a silver tap to his abdomen and likely saved his life. The young physician was also a philosopher, John Locke. Locke joined his new patron’s household in London, earning his keep as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Locke even invested in the Bahamas projects, and together the two drafted the (never executed) Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina (1669). Decades after his patron’s death, Locke would go on to write the Second Treatise of Government (1690), a famous critique of royal absolutism that premised its philosophical argument on an archaic “state of nature” when “in the beginning all the world was America.” ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=624))
- Shaftesbury’s intellectual circle advocated religious toleration and freedom of conscience. Before the Restoration, a few members of Shaftesbury’s group had also been members of the Hartlib circle, followers of the philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon, and of the Prussian émigré polymath Samuel Hartlib, who believed in the possible infinite “improvement” of the world.21 Eventually these sensibilities would crystallize, and the refractions would become the eighteenth-century British Enlightenment. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=632))
- Benjamin Worsley, a Hartlibian before the Restoration and afterward a member of Shaftesbury’s circle, explained that the state’s interest in commerce was “widely different from the mercantile part of it.”22 For it was the duty of the merchant to consider not the public interest but rather only his “privatt profitt.” Shaftesbury agreed. The state should promote commerce, an ever more critical source of imperial wealth. But the state must also regulate private self-interest so that commerce might lead to a desirable public end. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=638))
- The paradox that state authority should encourage the wealth-generating capacities of private commerce yet still restrain commercial self-interest—a dangerous impulse that threatened moral and political order—defined mercantilism. It would define the Age of Commerce. The “privatt profitt” motive was not enough. Even when it was active, a long-enduring English political-economic tradition said it must never run unchecked. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=642))
- three building blocks for Shaftesbury’s generation to work with: the ethical ideal of “commonwealth”; the state theory of “political economy”; and the economic doctrine of “balance of trade.” ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=653))
- Mercantilism was first a political translation of the religious impulse at work in the concept of commonwealth. The commonwealth was an ideal vision of a “body politic,” consisting of interdependent and hierarchical ranks and orders. The dominant metaphor was anatomical. God was the head. Next came the nobility, down the chain of being. The poorest “sort” of commoners was at the bottom. Organically, the commonwealth functioned to achieve the collective interest of the common (or public) good. It had room for self-interested commerce, but individual acquisitiveness might upset it. The ultimate end of economic life was not private commercial gain. Rather, people should earn a proper share according to their function in the larger body politic. The commonwealth was not egalitarian. Nonetheless, it fulfilled an ethical-religious ideal of fairness. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=654))
- Altogether the commercial quest for profit might dangerously unleash infinite human desires. The limitless quest for something essentially finite would disrupt the natural harmony of the universe. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=667))
- various means to check capital’s quest for pecuniary gain also arrived that constricted that quest but also lent it validity. The ethical-religious notions at work in the commonwealth ideal traveled to colonial North America. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=681))
- John Winthrop, governor of the early Massachusetts Bay Colony, was a wealthy lawyer from Sussex, one of the most commercial regions in England. In 1630 he boarded the ship Arbella bound for America and sat down to write “A Model of Christian Charity.” Winthrop’s blueprint for a “city on a hill” was boilerplate commonwealth. God intended hierarchy: “in all times some must be rich, some poor, some high and eminent in power and dignity; others mean and in subjection.” ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=689))
- The Massachusetts Bay Colony (1629), after all, was also chartered as a joint-stock corporation, with investors. The great problem would be to reconcile commercial self-interest with the “common good.” ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=694))
- in England a translation of commonwealth principles from religious moralizing into government policy making was well under way. Moral denunciation could do only so much. Good laws backed by the coercive apparatus of the state were necessary to harmonize commerce and commonwealth. In this spirit, mercantilist market regulations, regulating everything from prices and wages to the quality of goods, filled many volumes.35 In this way, the state went about the work of “political economy.” ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=708))
- In seventeenth-century thought, there was no such thing as “the economy” as a distinct sphere from other arenas of human experience, as it is known today. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=712))
- Oeconomy, which descended from the Greek root oikos, invoked the prudent management of a household’s economic resources. Smith described political economy as “the science of a statesman,” aimed at achieving “plentiful” resources for national consumption while supplying “the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services.”37 Political life and economic life were entangled. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=714))
- Political economy would retain this core attribute—the refusal to separate states and markets, the joint pursuit of public good and private interest—throughout the Age of Commerce, far into the nineteenth century. Even if it has not been so dominant thereafter, this foundational mercantilist principle lives on, over the ages, to this day. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=720))
- In the Atlantic, the Iberian powers had first claimed dominion over the Americas. The English settled Barbados in 1625 in part because Spain neglected it. The English had to fight to gain and keep their Atlantic colonies. At war with Spain, Cromwell sent a fleet to the Caribbean in 1654, with the goal of conquering Hispaniola, but England would settle for the violent colonization of Jamaica.41 In the 1660s and ’70s, England fought a series of wars against the Dutch, explicitly over global market access.42 In 1664 Charles II dispatched a fleet to conquer New Netherland, which became the New York colony. English colonization in the Atlantic proceeded thus. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=727))
- In this context, the mercantilist economic concept of the “balance of trade” was a running scorecard tallying which imperial state was winning in the global zero-sum struggle over commerce. The doctrine had philosophical underpinnings, in the same neo-Aristotelian concept of a finite universe in which balance, not increase, was the natural state of affairs. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=744))
- Mercantilists sought to increase national wealth, but they did not live in a capitalist world of exponential economic growth. No one ever had. The concept of a finite universe, with a finite stock of wealth and commerce, reflected what must have seemed an inevitable brute material fact in an economic world where most populations struggled to scrape above subsistence. A surplus must simply come at the expense of someone else—or from untapped riches from a so-called New World. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=750))
- The most incisive mercantilists recognized that money is a dynamic factor in economic development. For in addition to being a medium of transaction, as well as a unit of account, money may also be a form of credit—and thus a form of pecuniary capital. Credit, at the very nerve center of capitalism, may finance, and thus draw out, more commerce, labor, and wealth-generating enterprise. Increasing returns to economic activity are unlocked. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=763))
- credit—backed by trust, confidence, expectation, and imagination, if not outright sheer fantasy—can also fund capital investment in new enterprise. Enterprise then creates new wealth, resulting in more savings, and so investment is as likely to lead to savings as savings is to investment.49 Some economic thinkers in the latter half of the seventeenth century very nearly stumbled on this idea. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=769))
- laws banning usury—high, stifling interest rates—became mercantilist devices. The prohibitions expressed the religious origins of mercantilism. Excessive covetousness in the form of high interest was forbidden, as it threatened the ethical ideal of commonwealth. Yet usury caps also kept interest rates low, which prevented merchant-bankers from exploiting the scarcity value of coin. By undercutting mercantile precaution, the effect of state intervention was to induce greater commercial investment and risk taking. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=796))
- Mercantilists supported those home industries that were capable of producing goods for export. Further, colonies could act as consumer markets of last resort, or “vents,” for manufacturers. For even as commerce and manufacturing expanded in unison, urban industry posed risks for the commonwealth—namely, poverty ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=811))
- Mercantilists generally promoted subsidies, taxes, and tariffs to protect employment-intensive as well as hard-currency-earning manufacturing exports.61 They wanted more commercial investment, and they would also target its content—industry. Still today, policies that subsidize domestic manufacturers are called mercantilist. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=815))
- No matter how absolutist the pretensions of the Crown were or were not, imperial sovereignty was more aspirational than accomplished. What historians call “composite” and “plural” rule, in which authority was dispersed to different institutions, was common, even inside England.62 Tellingly, joint-stock corporations—subsovereigns of a composite empire—which were owned by private investors, were first granted the task of colonizing North America and governing English subjects. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=823))
- By far the most organized Native power in contact with English North America was the Iroquois Confederacy, which had established trading alliances with various Indian nations. Through a trade in animal furs, the Iroquois absorbed early European settler-colonialists into their preexisting commercial networks. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=846))
- In principle, colonial commerce existed to favor England’s balance of trade. The colonies should not produce manufactures but instead should import them from England, stimulating English employment and exports. The colonists must not trade with England’s enemies but must give the home country its commerce. Cromwell’s Navigation Act of 1651 codified a long-standing rule that all colonial trade be conducted in English ships. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=853))
- Massachusetts blatantly pursued its own mercantilist policies. The colony encouraged its own manufacturers, regulated its own prices and wages, and minted its own silver coin.72 New England’s commercial economy attempted to duplicate England’s. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=860))
- the mercantilist premise that the state must direct long-term commercial development for the good of the imperial commonwealth, however defined. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=877))
- American commerce was all but left free of corporate trading monopolies (unlike in Asia, the East India Company’s jurisdiction) and opened to all Englishmen. Relatively, the colonists were taxed little. ([Location 890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=890))
- Shaftesbury never attempted to make the British imperial political economy a completely closed circuit. There would be “interlopers,” smugglers, and pirates, and the strict enforcement of the Navigation Acts might actually hinder the growth of English colonization and trade.81 Shaftesbury’s governing disposition approximated what Edmund Burke, in the throes of the American Revolution, would later christen “a wise and salutary neglect.”82 ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=895))
- within the English Empire, burgeoning colonial commerce properly channeled could increase the empire’s economic pie. That was the benefit of “free trade,” in the original meaning of that term: free trade within the empire. Within a well-ordered imperial political economy, everyone might gain from trade, even if the home country enjoyed the positive balance. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=902))
- In 1685 the Catholic James II ascended to the English throne and attempted to reorganize the North American colonies into something more like his personal dominions. He promulgated more absolutist enforcements of the Navigation Acts. Revolts in New England, New York, and Maryland accompanied the 1688 Glorious Revolution and Parliament’s invitation of William and Mary of Orange to the English throne. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=916))
- The Board of Trade—administrative inheritor of Shaftesbury’s Council for Trade and Plantations—was established in 1696. Locke was a member. By now, nearly two-thirds of English revenue came from taxes and duties on overseas trade, funding a powerful English fiscal-military state erected on the basis of wealth-generating commerce. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=928))
- From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War with France in 1756, the British Empire in the Atlantic enjoyed a remarkable institutional stability. The mercantile system induced a long commercial boom. The cumulative process was one of “Smithian growth.” ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=935))
- What determines the division of labor? The answer is the “extent of the market,” or the scope for sales. That is, there must be sufficient transactional liquidity—ready markets for goods on the demand side. When markets expand for goods, producers compete for them. They specialize and invest more capital in search of the gains from trade. They do this because of a natural human propensity to “truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.” It is commercial self-interest, or human nature, that is the mainspring of the division of labor. But the division of labor exists only in proportion to the “extent of the market.” ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=942))
- There is a “Smithian commercial multiplier,” with respect to wealth production for a community as a whole. (The question of distribution within that community is another matter.) The requirements for Smithian growth are interactive and, as demand and supply interactively feed off of each other, self-sustaining. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=948))
- Unhindered, the circular process of Smithian growth would seem to take care of itself. Smith famously referred to an “invisible hand.” ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=950))
- At first, the American colonies were supposed to be a “vent” not only for manufactures but also for the excess population of England. The first waves of migrants were largely Englishmen, many indentured servants. But because of migration, plague, and civil war, the English population began to decrease. Many officials, Shaftesbury included, now argued that England should retain its population. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=957))
- By the middle of the eighteenth century, commodities produced by black slaves accounted for 80 percent of all colonial American commodities exported back to the home country. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=968))
- Seventeenth-century colonial Barbados must have been one of the worst human societies to have ever existed. Free migrants simply would not go there. The tropical island, twenty-one miles long, fourteen wide, became riddled with deadly pathogens. The labor of planting and refining sugar was dreadful. Barbados imported 130,000 African captives between 1640 and 1700, and by 1660 there were already more blacks than whites on the island. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=972))
- The Barbados slave code of 1661, which secured common law property rights in human chattel, and set a legal precedent for other English colonies, was draconian.96 That was putting it nicely. Overseers hung disobedient slaves from trees in iron cages, leaving them to die of thirst as examples to others. By the 1710s, in not too dissimilar fashion, Jamaica—first a hub for English buccaneers—was producing more sugar than Barbados. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=975))
- The governor noted that every “foot of land,” up to the “seaside,” was in sugarcane.98 Plantations, each of which averaged 250 black laborers, maintained a detailed division of labor. Enslaved blacks were capital assets, priced competitively in Atlantic markets.99 They could be replenished through purchase. All things considered, it was often more economical not to worry over their rapid depreciation—in other words, to work slaves to death. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=982))
- Winthrop worried that New England risked commercial collapse. But a Barbados planter wrote to him as early as 1647 requesting “trade for provisions for the belly.” The boom in Barbados sugar production increased the “extent of the market,” as Smith would put it, for New England fish, foodstuffs, timber, and livestock. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=991))
- Whether brought about by the Lord or by the invisible hand of the market, both Barbados and New England gained from the trade. Commerce multiplied. West Indian trading credits assisted New England imports of English manufactures. The British Empire’s multilateral Atlantic commercial system of triangular trades began to take shape. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=995))
- In 1708, Carolina became the first North American colony to have a black slave majority.105 Echoing the 1661 Barbados slave code, Shaftesbury and Locke’s Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina had declared, “Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1009))
- by the time the tobacco market boomed again, large planters had further consolidated their power by importing enslaved Africans. Black slaves became cost effective, relative to paying white indentured servants.114 By 1750 in Virginia, there were roughly 100,000 black slaves, about 40 percent of the population. An ideology of white racial domination hardened. ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1029))
- New England, consisting of the colonies of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, exported foodstuffs, livestock, fish, whale products, and rum. Its merchant class soon thrived in the Atlantic carrying trades, including the slave trade. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1042))
- Left alone, commerce would lead to an enlightened commonwealth, Smith argued. Eighteenth-century colonial North America, much more the North than the social disaster that was the early West Indies, began to reflect Smith’s moral vision. Coffeehouses, libraries, and theaters appeared. Colonial elites rushed to participate in a British Atlantic consumer culture, sustaining, in good mercantilist fashion, considerable consumer markets for English manufacturers. By the 1750s, North America was the fastest-growing destination for British goods.125 Commercial refinement became a marker of status. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1056))
- Some religious leaders began to equate commercial gain with spiritual gain, during a wave of evangelical religious awakenings in the 1730s and ’40s, called the First Great Awakening. “Covetousness,” New Jersey reverend Joseph Morgan declared in The Nature of Riches (1732), “makes for the public good.” ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1062))
- trade within the British Empire became so mutually beneficial that the Navigation Acts became nearly self-enforcing. Colonists complained about the shortage of coin (colonial legislatures experimented with paper currencies in violation of imperial law), the empire’s refusal to support free immigration, and imperial prohibitions on trade with Latin America. Politically, most colonists sided with the “Patriot” faction of English Whigs, who looked favorably on American commerce and lent less consideration to West Indian sugar interests.134 On the whole, many prospering white eighteenth-century colonial Americans became proud British subjects. By its own standards, the mercantilist project of Shaftesbury and his circle had proved a dazzling long-term success. ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1088))
- what is the legacy of mercantilism for the history of American capitalism? One legacy is the horror of chattel slavery and the birth of a modern racism that American capitalism has failed to rid itself of down to this day. In almost every human society in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, base forms of domination remained the norm. But slavery died out in western Europe. The rise of black slavery in the Americas was a choice made by European rulers and capitalists. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1096))
- By the eve of the American Revolution, “the average American colonist ate better, was taller, and lived longer than did the average Englishman” and probably the average person anywhere. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1113))
- What British mercantilism did was to transform the North Atlantic into a vast imperial trading zone. Expanding territory was what empires instinctively sought to do. Over history, empires have proved to be very effective extenders of commercial markets across space, thus ensuring market demand for their various subjects. Smithian dynamics appeared within all European empires, as well as in Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, the Iroquois Confederacy, Qing China, the Ottoman and Persian empires, and the sub-Saharan Bornu Empire (and long before, it seems, in the Roman Empire).141 The historical record is very clear. “Free trade” has always been an achievement of the legal infrastructure of state power. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1127))
- The colonial American economy was, in the words of the historian E. A. Wrigley, an “advanced organic economy”—advanced because of its commercial character, organic because of the nature of the raw inputs of economic production.1 Most manufactured goods were processed organic matter, whether wool, hides, straw, or fur. Water, wind, and human and animal muscle powered production. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1162))
- In preindustrial economies, without extending the amount of land under cultivation or increasing its productivity, very little growth was possible. Otherwise, there would not be enough food for everyone to eat, and not much labor could be shed from agriculture to manufacturing and commerce anyway. There could be no gains from trade, no division of labor, and no Smithian growth. In the end, however, only so much of the earth’s surface can be cultivated, and extending cultivation onto poor soils does not increase productivity. If, in commerce, the Smithian commercial multiplier is a possibility, allowing returns to economic activity to increase over time, then in agriculture, because of ecology, the specter of diminishing returns is ever present. Scarcity looms, as a brute material fact. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1175))
- Already by 1300, no more than 10 percent of England was still forested. The seventeenth-century poet Henry Vaughan began his poem “The Timber” declaring “Sure thou didst flourish once!”10 But then the climate cooled, inaugurating what archeologists call a five-hundred-year “Little Ice Age.” Between the Great Famine (1315–22) and the Black Death (1347–53), the English population halved. ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1204))
- Malthus explained that while population growth was geometric, the expansion of wealth production, and thus food production, was only arithmetic. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1209))
- The relative abundance of land, not its scarcity, was perhaps the chief economic fact of the Age of Commerce in North America. Because of it, colonial Americans grew up to be taller, stronger, and healthier than their European peers. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1222))
- The household was the central institution of early American economic life—the central institution of life, full stop.17 Kinship, custom, law, and intimacy defined their character. Households carried out the task of “oeconomy,” or the management of household wealth. Households were also governing institutions. In a world of “composite” and “plural” sovereignty, where imperial authority could be weak on its frontier, households, along with corporations, were the ruling subsovereigns of the British Empire. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1229))
- Individuals’ relative position within the “little commonwealth” of the household, defined by sex, age, and race, determined their civic status. Men—husbands, fathers, and masters—were “independent” heads of household. Landed property was the anchor of their political “liberty.” Wives, children, servants, and enslaved persons were their “dependents.” A household was a social hierarchy where “reciprocal, not equal, rights prevailed.” So did love, but also cruelty.

- The “household sector,” as it is known today—with much of it not counted in contemporary calculations of a national economy’s gross domestic product (GDP)—accounted for almost the entirety of early American economic production, most of it destined for direct consumption, not commerce.19 At this time, any distinction between the family and the market, home and work, would not have made much sense. Economy was no distinct sphere. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1238))
- When the American Revolution broke out, at least 80 percent of the population still worked the land, and no more than 5 percent lived in cities, defined as urban settlements of 2,500 or more. An account of early American economy must attend to the interacting rhythms of organic economy and household economy, as commerce progressed in the midst of their cadences. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1246))
- Despite a long-enduring colonial myth that says otherwise, Native American nations had property. The first generations of English colonizers, if not future ones, recognized this, and the partial commensurability of Native and English property systems was a medium of early contact and diplomatic exchange—a medium through which some Native nations sought to incorporate European populations into their political worlds, and through which the British Empire sought to subordinate Native nations into its own composite imperial sovereignty. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1257))
- colonizers brought with them to America a property regime that did not always make sense to Native Americans. It was a most peculiar English legal institution: private property. Private meant having the power and right to “exclude” others—even the state, if only to some extent—from the prerogative to enjoy the possession, use, or exchange of a particular object. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1262))
- The most consequential principle of English private property for the history of American capitalism was the Enlightenment doctrine of “improvement.” Fittingly for this age, improvement warranted the simultaneous expansion of both British imperial power and private commerce in North America. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1265))
- What made landed property private was not only its possession but also its aggressive commercial cultivation, a lever, most colonizers believed, of material advance and civilizational progress. ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1267))
- Capital is a form of property. Legally, the origin of contemporary private property rights—today including everything from intellectual property, to human genes, and to digital music streaming—is land. All the way back in ancient Rome, the legal concept of dominium was associated with landownership, in which “ownership was absolute: distinct, singular, and exclusive.” ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1275))
- In England, before the Norman Conquest of 1066, land could be alodial, meaning it was not subject to the rule of any feudal lord. Alodial land was the origin of what in the United States would become the “public domain.” After the Norman Conquest, the Crown claimed title to all the land in England. In theory, the king’s sovereignty was not up for sale. Land could be “held” by a subject but not “owned.” In practice, English land became subject to a system of tenures. The monarchy released its grip, and landed estates fell into the grasp of the hereditary nobility. Tenants-in-chief (in capite) were those who owed a service to the Crown (often military service). Land held in capite became the basis of aristocratic lords’ wealth and status. However, most medieval Englishmen were commoners—peasants not noblemen—and held no legal tenure. To meet their subsistence needs, peasants fought tooth and nail to maintain customary use rights in land, a kind of extralegal possession. Lords extracted economic surpluses from peasants, but they also had obligations toward them to ensure their safety and subsistence. The point is that, except for the sovereign, in theory absolute and exclusive private property rights in land did not exist. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1286))
- The fourteenth-century Black Death began to change this situation. Half the population perished, and the land-to-labor ratio soared. Peasants occupied vacated lands, and lords required new incentives to recruit peasant labor. A new land tenure emerged to compete with in capite. The doctrine of ut de manore restricted duties to the Crown, and lords had less scope to directly govern the occupants of their manors. Some peasants acquired legally enforceable and inheritable “copyholds.” Lords struck back, commuting “copyholds” into “leaseholds.” Peasants might now commercially lease lands. As England commercialized, the monarchy commuted in capite services to money (taxes). Slowly, layers of propertied claims unfurled, as more direct commercial relationships formed between English subjects and landed property, as an object. The ancient Roman legal notion of absolute dominion, in a private key, became newly prominent in property discourse. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1295))
- Ultimately, a series of parliamentary acts—culminating, in Shaftesbury’s day, in the Statute of Tenures (1660)—reduced the complexity of English property law. The shift was toward exclusive and absolute legal titles. The ownership of land became more capitalistic. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1304))
- Between the lords and the landless, a new middle stratum of “husbandmen” emerged. Many were tenants, but some achieved the cherished commoner property claim, yet another tenure, of “fee simple” landownership. That meant they were “freeholders” and thus “independent” owners of property. They were autonomous “heads” capable of setting up their own households. The most commercially vigorous of the English freeholders were the “yeomen.” For white male heads of household, colonial North American was to be a yeoman’s paradise. ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1316))
- nearly all the North American colonies carved out some form of communal “commons.” Nonetheless, landed property, regardless of its commercial value, continued to earn its owner the cherished civic and political status of “independence.”31 To be under the thumb of no lord. To have no master. To have household dependents of one’s own. ([Location 1326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1326))
- colonial North America did not evade the feudal past. The Crown granted “proprietary” colonies to Catholic Lord Baltimore (Maryland, 1632), to Shaftesbury’s circle of investors in Carolina (1663), to the founders of New Jersey (1664), and to the Quaker nobleman William Penn (Pennsylvania, 1681), all in capite. ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1330))
- Colonial legislatures usually doled out land to all freeborn Englishmen according to “headright,” or the number of members in one’s household. In Virginia, the great planters gamed the system, claiming acres on the heads of their black slaves (an eerie premonition of the U.S. Constitution’s three-fifths clause). ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1337))
- Legally, the vast majority of American colonists enjoyed the cherished land tenure of freeholding or fee simple ownership. Private property rights emerged in a stronger form in colonial America. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1340))
- North America had more smallish landowners of capital than did Europe. “The hopes of having land of their own & becoming independent of Landlords is what chiefly induces people into America,” noted a New York official.35 As John Locke explained, without secure property rights in land that was free from arbitrary interference, there was no guarantee of republican liberty. ([Location 1347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1347))
- Many northeastern American Indian communities were seasonally migratory, even if they often still engaged in horticulture, such as the Narragansett, Massachusett, and Wampanoag, populous Algonquian-speaking nations of New England. In such indigenous polities, sovereignty and property did not commonly equate to permanent, fixed possession of land, in either its public or private guise.37 Sovereignty flowed more from human relationships than from territorial possession, which then mapped onto control over resources, justifying multiple claims to them. Controlling land use made sense, as did acknowledging another nation’s possession of a loosely bounded territory (although fencing in land was not common) and even in some instances the exchange of use rights. ([Location 1355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1355))
- What did not make much sense to most Native American nations was to completely abstract land from the “life activity” of relationships in the human and spiritual worlds, and for individuals to assert exclusive claims to land backed by the coercive apparatus of law. ([Location 1363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1363))
- European legal traditions said land could not be dispossessed, even from “savages,” without justification. Locke provided a justification, in the chapter entitled “Property” in his Second Treatise of Government (1690), that implicated the doctrine of improvement. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1367))
- Locke began with a fundamental assumption of man’s common ownership in the natural bounty provided by God’s munificence.40 Property resulted when a self-owning claimant “mixed” his labor with what lay within common ownership. By labor, Locke did not mean only exertion; he meant the extension of personality into the external world. In doing so, the extender extracted from the pool of common ownership an exclusive right to control some portion of it. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1369))
- Thus, Locke wrote, the “wild Indian” who shoots a deer in “America” is entitled to its carcass and meat but not to the forest in which he killed it. That would require a conscious effort to clear, cultivate, and fence the land. The improvement that thus resulted excluded “the common right of other Men.” ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1372))
- the insinuation of Locke’s famous discussion of property was that Native Americans did not improve the land and that therefore all of America still lay in common ownership, ripe for dispossession. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1377))
- improvement became an argument for why English public and private property—its commons and its independent plots—might justifiably dispossess Indian lands. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1385))
- Locke made one exception: those who dispossessed land always had a duty to leave enough for everyone else should they want to mix their labor with it, improve it, and claim it as their own. It was truly the spirit of improvement and civilizational progress that a land grab must not leave anyone else worse off. ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1387))
- colonial households rotated corn, squash, and beans along with European cereals and legumes across three fields. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1421))
- Corn required tending about fifty days a year. It yielded a far more abundant harvest than did the European cereals wheat, oats, and rye. An acre of good land could yield 30 to 50 bushels of corn. Colonists ate corn puddings, breads, meals, mushes, and mashes. Distilled corn became whiskey, dried husks stuffed mattresses, and dried stalks served as toilet paper. Two acres could feed the typical colonial household. Five acres was an un-eatable abundance. ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1426))
- Way back in ancient times, cattle were likely the first productive asset or “capital good”—the return or yield was that they gave birth and multiplied. Among the many roots of the word capital in Latin is the meaning “heads of cattle,” while pecus, the Latin root of pecuniary, meant “flock.” From the ancient world through the seventeenth century, exploitation of animal energies achieved the bulk of preindustrial gains in productivity. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1433))
- Plowing, sowing, and harvesting could be performed only about seventy-five days per year. Planting and harvesting bracketed the summer. Animal slaughter preoccupied the fall. Household manufacturing dominated the winter. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1455))
- Over the course of the long eighteenth-century commercial boom, the British North American colonies ruralized. While the absolute number of people in cities grew, after 1680 the urban share of the colonial population actually fell.60 Why was colonial America not a more urban society? Why were colonial Americans so restless to move? The hunger of households for landed independence was strong. ([Location 1460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1460))
- Landownership, and a going farm, were not enough to make a man truly “independent.” English liberty had relational properties as well. An independent man was a head of household—a husband, father, and perhaps also a master with dependents of his own. The social hierarchies and thick personal relationships of household government shaped the economic lives of all. ([Location 1470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1470))
- The household—like the corporation, whether a joint-stock trading company or a municipality—was a subsovereign of the British Empire. It was a “little commonwealth.” The “head” of household ruled. The anatomical metaphor was no accident. The “head” made decisions on the household’s behalf. He had voice in civic and public affairs. The head stood for election in assemblies, entered contracts, and served on juries. The head possessed the legal standing to own property. Because the ownership of property was necessary for voting in this era, on the eve of the Revolution two-thirds of male American colonials qualified to vote (compared to only a quarter in England). ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1472))
- In the colonies, political rights and property in land were distributed relatively equally among white men. There were many small owners of capital. ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1477))
- In 1790 the median American household size was 5.7 free persons; including enslaved persons, it was 7.04.63 This meant that on the eve of the Revolution, 50 percent of the colonial population were children.64 Eighty percent of the colonial population were legal dependents of some kind, compared to less than 70 percent in England. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1480))
- Patriarchy—absolute power over dependents, even life and limb—was an invented political tradition of the late seventeenth century. Sir Robert Filmer’s political treatise Patriarcha (published posthumously in 1680) was the touchstone, arguing that the rule of the father was the basis of all sovereignty. Locke differed. In civil and political society, the right to rule continuously resulted from consent. Heads of households agreed to be governed so that their property rights would not be infringed. In addition to Lockean republicanism, the ideology of patriarchy circulated in the colonies, especially in the southern colonies among the great planters. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1486))
- Capitalistic to be sure, the great planters’ turn to black slavery in eighteenth-century Virginia oeconomy also became a self-consciously patriarchal project. ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1497))
- There was an aspect of patriarchy in the English legal principle of coverture, which defined wives as femes coverts whose legal personhood vanished into their husband’s. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1499))
- As for marriage, Blackstone explained: By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband: under whose wing, protection, and cover, she performs everything; and is called in our law-French a feme-covert….Her condition during her marriage is called her coverture.68 ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1503))
- Oeconomy was a common project, and women’s contributions to economic life were critical. In this era, women’s labors were visible and valued, placing them in the middle of early American economy. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1523))
- During the colonial period, roughly half of all willing migrants were indentured servants of some kind.72 There were two waves of white indentures, a seventeenth-century migration to the Chesapeake, and a subsequent eighteenth-century one to the Delaware Valley. Indentures normally lasted between four and seven years, and young men usually traveled in hopes of bettering their conditions and setting up their own households. Many succeeded. But legally, white servants and black slaves alike became members of their masters’ households. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1532))
- Within the category of master and servant, there were two more subsets, in addition to indenture. One was wage work. Wages in America were by comparison with England high, but “hirling” was still a dependent legal status. Hirlings could not legally quit before ending their term of service. If they did, they could not claim wages for past services rendered. In these important respects, wage labor was not yet “free labor,” in the later sense of the term. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1543))
- In return, masters owed duties to wage workers. Hirlings could not be fired. If they became injured or sick in the course of their duties, their masters had to provide for them. Reciprocal, “not equal” rights prevailed. ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1547))
- Colonies used household government to ameliorate pauperism and poverty. That is, instead of funding almshouses or conducting “poor relief,” some colonies paid heads of household to take in orphans, as well as the elderly and the disabled.76 The distinction between “servant” and “guardian,” another of Blackstone’s oeconomical relations, could be fuzzy. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1549))
- Enslaved people had no legal right to exit the status. Colonial manumission was infrequent. Forty percent of all migrants to the colonies were African captives, and on the eve of the American Revolution, 20 percent of the British North American population was enslaved. Ninety-six percent of black people in the colonies were enslaved members of white households.77 While the remaining 4 percent were not enslaved, they had no secure legal standing to set up households of their own. ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1554))
- Black slaves were human chattel. The colonial law of slavery, at first following the influential Barbados slave code of 1661, moved closer and closer to granting slaves the same attributes of private property as land. ([Location 1558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1558))
- North American slave fertility was high, which granted black kinship a different quality. But at the same time, black sexual reproduction and reproductive labor represented for the white master a form of capital accumulation. The enslavement of black women represented a potential form of capital asset appreciation for the white master, as prospective biological increase meant prospective commercial increase. The biological increase of enslaved African and Afro-descendant people resonated with the origin of the concept of capital and its notions of multiplication and increase. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1584))
- If we measure economic inequality with respect to household income and wealth, in 1774 the thirteen North American British colonies were economically the most equal society in the world (that can be measured) and also enjoyed the best standard of living in the world. American household incomes were on average 56 percent higher than those in England. Due to resource abundance, the relative cost of living in America must have been low. Wealth, property, and capital were much more widely dispersed. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1590))
- By these measurements, in 1774 the colonies were economically more equal than is the United States of the early twenty-first century. Back then, the top 1 percent of earners (including slave owners) earned 8.5 percent of total income. In the early twenty-first century, the top 1 percent earn more than double—20 percent of all total U.S. income. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1596))
- To enjoy liberty was precisely to live an economic life with personal dependents, whether ruling over them, loving them, or doing some combination of both. ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1605))
- The great economic historian William Parker once astutely proposed that the early American household had a split economic personality.90 The conflict was between two ideal types that he called the “peasant” and the “gambler” mentalities. All colonial American households were peasants and gamblers to various degrees. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1613))
- The peasant desired landed property—political security of title, a home for the household, and noncommercial access to life’s basic economic necessities. For the peasant, landed property, as wealth, secured a certain standard of living, but it was also something more than capital. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1616))
- By contrast, the gambler regarded landed property as capital. Desiring future pecuniary income, the gambler chased what Adam Smith called the “gains from trade.” ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1618))
- Gambler and peasant alike desired secure land tenures and property rights, but they had different motivations. The gambler wanted property rights in order to secure his pecuniary investment in a capital asset. In colonial America, a speculative capitalist land market flourished. ([Location 1620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1620))
- Given land’s marketability and the lack of coin, landownership was a means to store value—if only in preparation for the next speculative strike. ([Location 1629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1629))
- Speculation rewarded early colonizers, land hunters who “secured an interest.” There were capital gains to be had—asset price appreciation—when the edge of colonization caught up. To read letters written by the founding generation of the United States is sometimes to feel as though one has inadvertently cracked a ring of savvy land speculators. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1630))
- The peasant was no less hungry for land, and willing to grab it, but for different reasons. Lacking elite means to file land titles, peasants hoped “improving” land might be enough to ground a legally recognized claim. They wanted unimpeachable property rights because landed property and wealth—and only landed property and wealth—provided freedom from arbitrary interference over their lives. To get land from Indians, peasants did not so much subtly swindle them; they attacked them, violently, often bucking imperial authorities. This culminated, on the eve of the American Revolution, in the series of land-grabbing backcountry “Regulator” insurgencies. ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1654))
- For masterless American yeomen, landownership brought independence not only from arbitrary social and political power (the uncertainty Smith feared the most) but also from the vagaries of commercial markets. The extent of the market was not always assured. The peasant mentality intuited that market economies cannot always guarantee sufficient demand for all of the goods supplied by producers. ([Location 1662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1662))
- What Jefferson was saying was that an economic life of commerce alone was too unstable to adequately ground an “independent” household. The household had to be able to support itself. Only when it produced a surplus above what it consumed was it time to head to markets, in order to exchange for that which the household did not or could not produce, or to gamble on the gains from trade. ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1671))
- By the end of the colonial period, great planters and middling yeomanry alike widely practiced a system of commercial “safety first” agriculture, or what households called achieving a “competency.”101 The average early American household directly consumed most household production. At the end of the colonial period, 9 to 13 percent of colonial economic production was destined for Atlantic markets. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1679))
- From his position in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson became the most articulate defender and advocate of a popular oeconomical ideology that said commerce, while it must be promoted, must also be held in check. He would take this vision into revolutionary battle. ([Location 1689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1689))
- After Britain’s costly Seven Years’ War with the French Empire, however, its Stamp Act of 1765 placed a new levy on American property to raise imperial revenue. More taxes, as well as London’s repeated attempts to rein in colonizers’ incursions onto Indian lands, brought about the antagonisms that led to the War of American Independence. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1696))
- Only a second war with Great Britain, the War of 1812, secured a lasting national independence. By then, the character of the republican political economy that emerged from what might be called the “long America Revolution” (1765–1815) was clear. ([Location 1702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1702))
- their mutual loathing was the flashpoint in the revolutionary conflict over a republican political-economic settlement. There is no other best place to begin to chart the significance of the American Revolution in the history of American capitalism. ([Location 1716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1716))
- Further, after centuries of mercantilist imperial state building, most actors appreciated that the political and the economic were thoroughly entangled. The idea, in the words of the historian Gautham Rao, “that the state and the marketplace must be distinct simply did not exist.”5 And in this era, politicians—not men of business enterprise—were most responsible for charting the republic’s long-term economic future. ([Location 1722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1722))
- During the revolutionary epoch, contingent political events, not entrepreneurial innovation, most determined the trajectory of economic change. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1727))
- Disorderly public finances and a period of monetary inflation imploded the credit system, followed by a postindependence moment of deflation and crippling debt, made all the worse because the British, remaining mercantilist, cut the Americans out from long-cherished West Indian markets. Between 1770 and 1800, according to estimates, per capita incomes probably declined by more than 20 percent. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1732))
- Battles over the memory and meaning of the Revolution define politics for years, and the personalities of revolutionary leaders become objects of ideological projection reflecting the political fault lines of the Revolution itself.10 During the 1790s, something like this happened with Hamilton and Jefferson. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1743))
- The first disagreement between what would later become the Hamilton and Jefferson blocs appeared trifling: how much should Congress tax incoming British ships? From this disagreement erupted an epic conflict. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1746))
- Foreign commercial policy was no trifling matter. Not only did export markets provide American commerce with its most critical source of demand, geopolitically the U.S. republic was born a minor power in a world of belligerent empires. In his approach, Hamilton chose commercial rapprochement with the British Empire. Meanwhile, emulating the British model, as secretary of the Treasury he launched an ambitious federal program to kick-start long-term national economic development. Finance, commerce, and manufacturing would prosper in unison—Enlightenment “improvement” on a grand scale. To initiate economic development, Hamilton would opportunistically reorganize the public finances. He would have the federal government capitalize a long-term public debt, a step toward fostering a dynamic private capital and credit market, as British experience proved. He would also charter a Bank of the United States in the image of the Bank of England. On behalf of his various projects, Hamilton always sought to energetically entangle private profit seeking and public power, market and state. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1747))
- Jefferson objected. As secretary of state, he desired for the United States to break free, immediately, from all commercial dependence on the mercantilist British Empire. By opening up its ports to all nations, the U.S. republic would become a beacon of “free trade” to the world. Meanwhile, if Hamilton’s sympathies were with urban, commercial elites, Jefferson’s were with rural white heads of household, even with lesser yeomen. Hamilton looked east to the British model of long-term economic development. Jefferson looked west, eyeing the continental interior. The republic’s long-term future, in his view, lay in more settler colonialism, including the slave-based variety. Not the economic development of finance, commerce, and manufactures in unison but widespread white male property ownership should be the aim of republican political economy.

- During the mid-1780s, imports from Britain tripled American exports.16 Debts filled the gap. The Articles of Confederation (written in 1777, ratified in 1781) rendered Congress hapless before British mercantilism. Nine individual states passed mercantilist restrictions against British imports but also against the individual states. During the 1780s, for instance, Connecticut imposed heavier duties on goods from Massachusetts than on those from Great Britain.17 National trade policy was nonexistent. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1792))
- A debt was a contract, the creditor’s property right. The Revolution, after all, was fought because Great Britain taxed American property without their consent. Now overzealous democratic “majorities” trampled on private property rights. Hamilton also believed debts had to be paid in full, because rich Americans, not to mention Europeans with capital to invest abroad, would not invest in the United States if men like Hezekiah Mahem could shove it down their throats. Hamilton worried over investor confidence. ([Location 1813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1813))
- On the money question, the Constitution of 1787 had much to say. It came down in favor of creditors. Article I, section 8 prohibited state governments from printing paper money and placed the power to coin money exclusively in the hands of the new federal government. So much for the state printing presses. Further, Article I, section 10 prohibited states from “impairing the obligations of contracts.” That included the obligations of debtors to pay their creditors. Article III created a new system of federal courts, which Madison, at this point in agreement with Hamilton, believed was necessary, in part, because state courts were too friendly to farm debtors. ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1826))
- After ratification, when Madison and Hamilton, two ardent 1780s “nationalists,” arrived in New York City to implement the new Constitution, they came as allies. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1833))
- Arguably, public debt was the most explosive political issue of the revolutionary era on both sides of the Atlantic. British public debt had led to the 1765 Stamp Act and ultimately the American Revolution. French public debt had led King Louis XVI to convene the Estates-General, leading to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Conceivably, American public debts threatened to undermine the very existence of the young republic. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1841))
- He proposed the following. The United States would pay foreign creditors in full. The domestically held debt would be refinanced, at face value through the issue of bonds that, some technicalities aside, paid 4 percent interest—2 points less than originally promised, reducing the immediate need for federal revenue by a third. To all debt-holders, foreign and domestic, Hamilton guaranteed interest payments in hard currency, ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1847))
- Next, Hamilton proposed that the federal government assume all state debts. Finally, the federal debt would be permanent. The reissued U.S. bonds carried no maturity dates. The principal might never be repaid, but interest payments would extend into the infinite future. At present, Hamilton said, the federal government would service only interest payments. To do so, he calculated that the new federal government would need $2.8 million in annual revenue. There would be small internal taxes on property, such as an excise on the production of alcohol. Hamilton also proposed an “impost” on foreign commerce, a modest tariff on imports—by English manufactures mostly. ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1851))
- By 1790 less than 2 percent of Americans owned Revolutionary War debts.29 Hamilton’s measures granted these elites a windfall payout—face value, in hard currency, at reasonable rates of interest. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1859))
- As for the federal government’s “assumption” of the state debts, Madison believed Virginia, less in debt than other states, would pay more than its fair share under Hamilton’s scheme. Madison had the votes in Congress to block the measure, and he did. ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1866))
- After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the publicly chartered but privately operated Bank of England (1694) had funded a permanent British national debt. Britain became what historians now call a “fiscal-military state,” with the resources to win imperial wars.32 Backed by public authority, a private capital market was formed with rates and terms anchored to the circulating public debt. British public debt had become a symbol of national and imperial strength and also a trigger of long-term capitalist development. In England, the industrial revolution was beginning. ([Location 1875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1875))
- As Hamilton explained in “Report on the Public Credit,” the right financial system was necessary to bring that economic potential forward into the present. The answer was “bank money” or “credit money,” British style. With a permanent national debt, funded by earmarked future revenues, U.S. public debts would circulate in the hands of private investors and fulfill “most of the purposes of money.” The public debt market would also set a foundation for a private capital market in securities. Hamilton would establish the hard-currency value of the dollar in his 1791 “Report on the Establishment of a Mint,” and the Constitution had abolished the state paper printing presses. The scarcity value of money was secure. Hamilton could now vest the discretionary power to expand the money and credit supply in the hands of profit-seeking mercantile elites. From the supply side, an investor class of national elites would trigger wealth-generating investments in enterprise. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1882))
- There must be commerce, but there would be checks. “It is as easy to change human nature,” Hamilton addressed the New York constitutional ratifying convention in 1788, “as to oppose the strong current of the selfish passions.” But the “wise legislator will gently divert the channel, and direct it, if possible, to the public good.”36 The goal was to create the right combination—which sounded like the first Earl of Shaftesbury. As Hamilton explained in Federalist no. 12, “The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth, and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares.” ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1898))
- Some of the Anti-Federalist critics of the Constitution had said commercial self-interest alone might act as “a bond of union.”38 Hamilton did not agree. In a republic, only state power could harmonize the tension between private self-interest and the public good. The private and public interest must, and would, entangle. The question was the right integration and how to achieve it. ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1904))
- Hamilton can claim originality as a political economic thinker. His thought can best be labeled “Hamiltonian.” ([Location 1908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1908))
- He gambled that the right application of state power might just conjure a U.S. financial system capable of capitalizing commerce, agriculture, and manufacturing all at once. Likewise, he judged from the contemporary British example that not just more commerce—as in the classical mercantilist’s larger slice from the pie of world trade—but rather intensive national economic development was fast becoming the lever of power in international relations. ([Location 1912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1912))
- One more aspect of Hamilton’s economic worldview deserves mention. Born low, illegitimately, and an immigrant, he was a self-made elitist. The new federal government, on the make as well, was ripe for his ambition. Hamilton was a revolutionary and a republican, but he believed in government of the wise, the rich, and the good. He was no friend to democracy. “The people,” he announced to the Constitutional Convention, “are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.”41 ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1916))
- Hamilton hoped to hitch elites’ commercial self-interest to the project of building a strong national government. In turn, a strong national government would induce greater private investment among the mercantile elite.44 It must be said, few of the constitutional framers were farmers. ([Location 1925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1925))
- In the summer of 1790, Hamilton joined Madison for dinner at Jefferson’s Manhattan dinner table, and a compromise was reached. Madison accepted the federal assumption of debts. Hamilton agreed to support the eventual move of the capital from New York City to a miserable patch of swamp on the Potomac River, the future Washington, D.C. ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1928))
- Hamilton was not finished yet. Months later, in December 1790, he released his “Report on a National Bank,” proposing a twenty-year federal corporate charter for a Bank of the United States (BUS). He quoted Adam Smith on the benefits of what is today called a “fractional reserve” banking system, in which bankers lend more money than they hold in specie reserves, in order to explain how private banks transformed specie, or “dead stock,” into the “basis of paper circulation.” That extended credits beyond hard reserves, creating more funds for pecuniary capital formation and the multiplication of commerce. The profit-seeking BUS would make private loans through branches opened throughout the United States. It would thereby increase both the “quantity of circulating medium and the quickening of circulation,” keeping pecuniary capital in a state of “incessant activity.” ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1931))
- After the Revolution, there was a flurry of state-level chartering of joint-stock corporations, all profit seeking, but each with a stated “public purpose”—marine insurance corporations, turnpike corporations, but also some banking corporations.46 To critics, corporations were unrepublican, smacking of monarchical privilege and monopoly. Some did not want corporations chartered at even the state level.47 Secretary of State Jefferson and Congressman Madison made constitutional objections to Hamilton’s BUS, arguing that the federal chartering of corporations was not implicit in the Constitution’s “necessary and proper clause.” Hamilton made quick work of the Virginians’ legal arguments. The charter passed, and the BUS opened its book for subscriptions on July 4, 1791. Within an hour, there was no more stock left to sell. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1944))
- By sheer force of imagination and will, Alexander Hamilton was bringing to life a pecuniary capital market. To Jefferson, it was nothing short of the betrayal of the Revolution. The break from the British Empire was supposed to promote the interests of white rural heads of household, not those of finance capitalists. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1956))
- Hamilton and Jefferson were both republicans, but not all republicans shared the same political beliefs.49 American revolutionaries called themselves “Whigs,” and both Hamilton and Jefferson identified with the Whig legacy of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Both idealized the eighteenth-century British Empire, when the colonials had it good, and both argued that the Revolution had been necessary because George III’s policies had strayed from the true principles of British liberty. But after the Revolution, Hamilton’s republicanism moderated, while Jefferson’s radicalized, or at least it became even more anti-British. Certainly, he believed, Hamilton’s “scrippomania” was not in the spirit of ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1959))
- Jefferson, unlike Hamilton (and also Madison), was not an original thinker. His greatest talent was for Enlightenment sloganeering, and it was a formidable one. ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1972))
- Generally speaking, the proportion which the aggregate of the other classes of citizens bears in any state to that of its husbandmen, is the proportion of its unsound to healthy parts, and is a good-enough barometer whereby to measure its degree of corruption. While we have land to labour then, let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work-bench, or twirling a distaff. ([Location 1979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1979))
- The paragraph was a republican translation of the commercial safety-first strategy of rural American households. Liberty required independence—including from the caprice of customers, or from the vagaries of commercial demand, which no market-based economic system could ever ensure of its own accord. Any Virginia tobacco planter knew that from following the commodity’s extraordinary price volatility over the years. In commerce, dependence thus always loomed. ([Location 1983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1983))
- Republicans believed in a system of political representation. For this reason, in politics the American revolutionary leadership was obsessed with personal “virtue.” Republican leaders must act “disinterestedly,” on behalf of the common good. Politics should not be a venue for self-interested ambition, as that would lead to “corruption.” If a political representative were not “independent,” if he did not own sufficient property, his “dependence” would make him corruptible and unfit for republican rule. Hamilton would have agreed with all this. But Jefferson went further. Not only republican leaders but also republican citizens must be “virtuous” and “independent.” For that, they had to own a particular kind of property and wealth. Not financial “scrip,” which represented the whims of finance and therefore the risk of dependency. Republican citizens should really own land. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=1987))
- The leading English “Country” political theorist was Henry St. John, the first Viscount of Bolingbroke. George Washington literally plotted out his entire life to appear as if he had leaped directly from the pages of Bolingbroke’s The Idea of a Patriot King (1738), and he basically pulled it off. Everyone agreed that President Washington had republican “character.” ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2000))
- Jefferson democratized “Country” republicanism. Not the stolid gentleman farmer but rather the sturdy American yeoman was his ideal republican citizen. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2003))
- Jefferson was no simple yeoman. He enslaved black people and exploited them physically, sexually, and emotionally. His own republican “character” hardly rated. Hamilton called him a “contemptible hypocrite,” and contemptible or not, at minimum Jefferson was a hypocrite.55 Instead of “character,” he had, in the modern sense of the term, “personality,” which is why he continues to fascinate us today—whereas Washington, if more admirable, can come across as boring. Jefferson was truly conflicted about nearly everything in his life. He hated cities but loved Paris. He celebrated commercial independence but died under a mountain of debt. Probably he thought he was in love with one of his slaves. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2004))
- the war leveled tobacco markets, and Jefferson, among other Virginia planters reconsidering their views, even toyed with slave abolition.58 He inspired the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which banned slavery in the Old Northwest (the future states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana). ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2015))
- That Alexander Hamilton combined disdain for democracy with antislavery while Thomas Jefferson became a slave-owning apostle of the widening of democracy is one of the great paradoxes of American history. ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2018))

- Jefferson’s long-term political-economic program, no less fervently motivated than Hamilton’s, was simple: Expand the agrarian white yeoman republic across space. Look West.59 Above all, Americans needed Lebensraum. They must have property rights to secure their liberty. There would be commerce. Landed property was capital, but it was also something more. Land would ground a moralized republican political “independence” and “virtue.” White gentry and yeomen would merge into a rural “middle landscape,” an enlightened equipoise of commercial self-interest and rural republican simplicity. The virtuous subsovereign households of the republic would bask in “that happy mediocrity of condition.” ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2020))
- Jefferson believed that slavery, someday, by someone else’s doing, would die out. Blacks must return to Africa. Indians should civilize or be conquered. In 1780 Jefferson first called this vision an “Empire of Liberty.” His vision of a postrevolutionary settlement was a politics of property, a political economy of widespread white male property ownership. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2026))
- Later, he would recall Hamilton as a singular character. Of acumen outstanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example, as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation. ([Location 2036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2036))
- The project of republican nation making should not, in his view, be hitched to financial profit seeking. After the creation of a permanent public debt and an incorporated national bank, Jefferson was sure a litany of British horrors would come next: financial oligarchy, government patronage, parasitical bureaucracy, heavy taxation, a standing army and navy, wars. Aristocracy by birth, perhaps even monarchy, might return. ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2041))
- Hamilton’s policies posed for Jefferson a far more immediate problem: it was blocking Jefferson and Madison’s own legislative agenda for economic development, and they did have one. Their first plank was the antimercantilist principle of “free trade,” a radical Enlightenment ideal. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2044))
- On pragmatic grounds, Hamilton believed rapprochement with British mercantilism was prudent, and he was less interested in abstract philosophies of free trade. Jefferson, however, sought complete emancipation from the British mercantilist system. Let America, extending across continental space, dispose of its agricultural surpluses in Europe, the land of the workbench, the distaff, the city, the bond market, and the corrupt. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2047))
- Tensions emerged between the two future blocs at the opening of first Congress, when Congressman Madison proposed a Navigation Law against British imports—nearly a prohibitive ban. Wrongly, Madison believed the loss of the U.S. market would bring the British Empire to the negotiating table. But Jefferson agreed with him. Hamilton’s Treasury reports are justly celebrated, but few read Secretary of State Jefferson’s no less thorough “Report on the Privileges and Restrictions on the Commerce of the United States in Foreign Countries” (1793), a scathing assault on British mercantilism. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2052))
- Hamilton could not abide a steep tariff against British imports, for 77 percent of U.S. imports were then British.66 His proposed moderate duty was meant not to discourage British imports but rather to raise the fiscal revenue needed to fund assumption, and thus the permanent national debt, and therefore the entire Hamiltonian developmental project. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2057))
- Next, the “incitement and patronage of government” would be required to inspire nervous private citizens to invest in manufacturing. In particular, Hamilton said governments must attend to the “confidence of cautious sagacious capitalists.”67 To induce industrial investment, he proposed that the government make direct subsidies to select U.S. manufacturers—today called the “industrial policy” of picking winners. Also, Hamilton approved the chartering of a manufacturing corporation in New Jersey, the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (SEUM). ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2062))
- The short-lived financial panic of 1792 was the republic’s first. Deftly, Hamilton used Treasury funds to buy assets—today called “open market operations”—in order to bring back transactional liquidity and stabilize prices in the capital market. The panic quickly lifted. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2073))
- Finally, in a political error, Hamilton had snubbed existing U.S. manufacturers, the rising “mechanic interest.” These men consisted of skilled artisanal craftsmen, household based, not corporate—property owners, but with low capital requirements. Incorrectly, Hamilton did not believe they could ever be a great source of industrialization, and so his industrial plan had largely bypassed them. ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2084))
- The Virginians saw a political opportunity to expand Jefferson’s white yeoman ideology to encompass northern mechanics and even tradesmen who could not locate a scheduled federal Treasury auction. In 1792 Madison wrote an anonymous newspaper article accusing Hamilton of being “more partial to the opulent than to the other classes of society” and of believing that “mankind are incapable of governing themselves.”70 By the end of that year, Jefferson’s “republican interest,” or the Republicans, was publicly squaring off against “the Treasury” of Hamilton, or the Federalists. ([Location 2088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2088))
- Hamilton had the first chance at power. His fiscal policies were startlingly successful.73 U.S. commerce boomed. But somehow, politically, Hamilton still went down to defeat. ([Location 2106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2106))
- A month later a U.S. army offensive defeated an Ohio Valley confederacy of thirty-five Indian nations in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville (1795) ceded the Ohio Valley to the United States. ([Location 2112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2112))
- The French revolutionary wars opened fantastic trading opportunities for neutral American ships. In 1795 John Jay signed a treaty with mercantilist Great Britain that allowed Americans to make “broken voyages,” transporting French and Spanish West Indian products to the United States first, before reexporting them to Europe.

- Finally, Pinckney’s Treaty (1795) with the Spanish Empire secured U.S. access to the Mississippi River, including the right to deposit goods in the port of New Orleans. The Federalists thus secured, and expanded, the American foothold in the trans-Mississippi West. ([Location 2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2117))
- Hamilton chose the right time. The United States enjoyed its first national commercial boom. The success of Hamilton’s financial reforms deserves some credit. The BUS extended private loans, expanding the supply of money and credit. “Pecuniary capital” augmented. No less crucial were developments at the level of the states. During the 1790s, state governments chartered twenty-eight banks (after only three during the 1780s).78 In 1791 the British Board of Trade noted with approval the foreign investor protections of the new Constitution, and European investor confidence returned.79 Finance capital flowed into U.S. markets.80 There was a great burst of Smithian commercialization. ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2124))
- the immediate cause of the 1790s boom was the French revolutionary wars and the Atlantic commercial opportunities they made possible. Europeans demanded U.S. foodstuffs, which meant prosperity for the grain-growing mid-Atlantic states, as well as for U.S. shipping interests, which benefited the northeastern urban ports. While southern planters did not benefit so much, they found a new export staple—cotton. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2132))
- After having made peace with British mercantilism, economically the young U.S. republic was basically regressing to its colonial position, provisioning and trading with the West Indies, now under a neutral flag. Trading credits once again financed imports of British manufactures. ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2135))
- Despite the 1790s Atlantic commercial boom, Federalism lacked a sufficient popular constituency among white heads of household, especially rural ones. The leading northeastern ports of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia benefited most from the golden shower.86 Hamilton’s reforms were settling in. But the yeomanry, the mechanic interest, aspiring middling urban tradesmen, and many southern slave owners wanted something different than Atlantic commerce with war-torn Europe.

- To the Democratic-Republicans, it was one page after another pulled from the aristocratic and monarchical British playbook. There would be standing armies, internal taxation, incorporated banks, a national debt, ruling commercial elites, and after the Federalists pushed through the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798, the suppression of political dissent.

- In the presidential election of 1800, Jefferson—the southern candidate, aided by the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, which increased southern electoral clout by counting slaves as three-fifths of persons for purposes of representation—prevailed.88 Republicans trounced Federalists all the way down the ticket.

- Jefferson had first invoked the “Empire of Liberty” in 1780, to evoke a political confederation to benefit rural white heads of household, the yeoman subsovereigns of the republic. There was no way to have it without the colonization of the trans-Mississippi West. The project also required diverting a “branch of commerce,” as Jefferson put it, toward the Mississippi River.94 Upon taking office in 1801, Jefferson set about putting the program in action. To succeed would be to end U.S. commercial dependence on Atlantic commerce. At stake was the same phenomenon that had given rise to the Age of Commerce in the era of mercantilism—the geopolitics of market access and trade.

- The Treaty of Paris had ceded all British territory south of Canada and east of the Mississippi to the United States. But a number of Britain’s Indian allies did not recognize the cession. West of the Mississippi was Spanish Louisiana, acquired from France after the Seven Years’ War. It extended east across a narrow strip of Gulf coastland to Spanish Florida, which the Spanish used to control access to the great Mississippi port of New Orleans. The Spanish claimed territory east of Louisiana as far north as Tennessee. They sponsored Indian allies, including the Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee nations.

- But the most active and hostile agents west of the Appalachians were neither European empires nor Indian nations. They were American colonizers. Some flirted with separation from the United States, but these men—white yeomen heads of household—were Jefferson’s constituents. In 1780, the same year he announced the Empire of Liberty, Jefferson noted of the West that the national government could not hope to control colonization there. It was “necessary to give way to the torrent.” ([Location 2177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2177))
- The Louisiana territory was 820,000 square miles, forming a triangle with points at New Orleans and the future states of Minnesota and Idaho. Instantly the United States doubled in size, seemingly fulfilling Jefferson’s inaugural boast that the yeoman republic had “room enough” to last “to the hundredth and thousandth generation.”96 In capital markets, confidence in the U.S. government financed the long-term U.S. imperial expansion across space.

- The Federalists had originally hoped to control and slow the pace of settlement, much as prerevolutionary British imperial officials had done. They would acquire lands from Indian nations, by treaty, and sell off large blocs to wealthy speculators (maybe themselves) to help raise fiscal revenue. But after Jefferson came into office, Congress reduced the minimum purchase of federal land from 640-acre sections to 320 acres, at $2 an acre, with generous credit provisions. In 1804 60-acre lots went up for sale at $1.64 each. ([Location 2191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2191))
- A speculative market in western lands formed. The gambler arrived with the peasant. White colonizers, if not purchasing land, violated treaties and squatted and “improved” Indian lands, hoping to file recognized claims later. Thirty-three times, between 1800 and 1830, Congress would pass “preemption” laws legalizing squatting.99 Before the Revolution, only the Crown enjoyed preemption rights. Now so did yeomen households.

- in some respects Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty came to resemble the eighteenth-century British Empire.100 Congress revoked all internal taxes. The military budget was cut in half.101 A provision of the 1789 Constitution, the Commerce Clause, granted Congress the authority to regulate commerce “among the several states,” forbidding interstate mercantilist discrimination. The result was to check state discrimination, opening up a unitary commercial space and increasing the extent of markets and thus the demand for goods.

- Fighting a war, in 1805 Britain passed numerous restrictions on neutral U.S. shipping.108 On republican principle, the United States lacked the state capacity, including the naval power, to push back. So in December 1807 Congress followed Jefferson and passed an embargo forbidding all American vessels from sailing to foreign ports. Foreign ships were prohibited from exporting American goods. They could bring select imports but must then sail away empty, in ballast. Jefferson had, effectively, outlawed commercial prosperity. In 1808 U.S. exports plummeted dramatically, and so did customs revenue.109 Unpopular at home, the embargo failed abroad. ([Location 2234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2234))
- Jefferson retired to Monticello with his administration in tatters. But he had had enough of U.S. commercial dependence on Europe.110 The embargo would redirect American economic life inward. A home market would provide demand. Jefferson now spoke of the American “manufacturer” and the American “husbandmen” working “side by side,” both producers together in a perpetual struggle against parasitical, unrepublican merchant-speculators. ([Location 2241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2241))
- The embargo stimulated internal commerce and manufacturing—the small-scale, household variety, but also more innovative and lasting textile factories and machine shops.112 It was a remarkable shift from the colonial era. Americans now defined themselves not by their old consumer identities as British subjects but by their republican “productive labor.” ([Location 2245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2245))
- war with the British lurched toward inevitability. When it did break out in 1812, the United States was not prepared. Madison had allowed the federal charter of the BUS to expire in 1811, so it could not assist the federal government in mobilizing resources. ([Location 2249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2249))
- The Americans could not win the war, but neither could Great Britain hold the North American continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. The Treaty of Ghent (1814) ended the War of 1812 and established almost the status quo antebellum. Napoleon was soon defeated, so neutral commercial rights in the Atlantic would no longer be much of an issue anyway. ([Location 2257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2257))
- In declaring war, Madison had accused the British of rousing Indian “savages” in the West.113 A composite British imperial geography, which had granted Native nations some room to maneuver, including commercially, gave way to something different.114 The Empire of Liberty was not the same as European empires in this respect: it was less respectful of Indian sovereignty. It did not want to trade so much as to conquer. Popular violence was let loose against Indian peoples. ([Location 2261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2261))

- No doubt, Native Americans east of the Mississippi were the biggest losers in the long American Revolution, while the biggest winners were rural heads of household. The United States was born with a politics of property, a political economy of widespread white male property ownership, that would last far into the nineteenth century. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2270))
- The republican political economy born during the era of the long American Revolution led to the following settlement. Hamilton had laid the foundations for, as he put it, the augmentation of “pecuniary capital.” The U.S. dollar was linked to hard currency, and the scarcity value of money capital was secured. Through paper note issues in excess of coin reserves, the BUS expanded the supply of money and credit—capitalizing economic development. Jefferson could not uproot this incipient capitalist financial system. By the time the BUS’s federal charter expired in 1811, the state-level chartering of banks was well under way. Indeed, state governments energetically fostered economic development, in everything from chartering corporations, to creating infrastructure that increased the extent of markets, to, in the North, abolishing slavery. ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2272))
- But at the national level, a popular democratic mobilization of white heads of household dramatically overthrew not only monarchy but also any vestige of aristocracy or oligarchy.119 The national party of elites, the Federalists, would not take charge over the union. National plans for economic development were abandoned. Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty won out. Bottom-up, popular Republican nationalism, the colonization of Native American lands, household governance, the extension of slavery, and commercial self-interest would have to hold the union together. ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2278))
- There was, however, a final coda to the political-economic debates of the long Revolution. After the War of 1812, the Democratic-Republicans decided Hamilton had been right: a National Bank was both necessary and proper. On April 10, 1816, President Madison signed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States. ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2288))
- The United States was not at first a democracy. After the Revolution, even among white men, voting was restricted according to property ownership. Alexander Hamilton and other revolutionaries regarded democracy as a suspect proposition. Democracy had to “rise” in the U.S. republic, and the crucial decades when it did were those after the War of 1812.1 By 1828 property ownership was no longer a requirement for white male suffrage. In the presidential election that year, General Andrew Jackson roared into the White House on the back of a self-consciously democratic mobilization. ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2293))
- the result of Jackson’s two presidential administrations was a dramatic national political realignment. Jacksonians—self-styled inheritors of Jefferson’s legacy—called themselves “the Democracy.” Their opponents called themselves the Whigs. ([Location 2300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2300))
- In economic life, prominent continuities existed much as during the long Revolution. In production, the organic economy endured. The Empire of Liberty’s greatest subsovereign, the household, remained the central economic institution. Smithian dynamics in commerce persisted, which meant that the geopolitical extension of markets across space was the engine of growth. Aggressive white land grabs of Indian possessions expanded the Empire of Liberty westward. The core postrevolutionary settlement, a politics of property, held firm. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2305))
- The rise of American democracy accompanied two credit-led, speculative commercial investment booms. The first lasted from the conclusion of the War of 1812 until the Panic of 1819. The second began in the late 1820s and lasted until the Panics of 1837 and 1839. The Second Bank of the United States (BUS) extended money and credit beyond hard money reserves and capitalized wealth-generating labor and enterprise across the nation, much as Hamilton had said it would. ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2316))
- At the conclusion of the War of 1812, a number of national politicians who later became Whigs, led by the Kentucky congressman Henry Clay, put forward a long-term national plan for commercial development—the first since Hamilton. The federal government would manage land acquisition and sales, generating fiscal revenue. A steep tariff against foreign manufactures would protect young U.S. manufacturers and sponsor industrial production. The revenue from both would fund public investment in a coherent federal “system” of “internal improvements,” or the public infrastructure of roads, turnpikes, and canals necessary to expand access to market demand. From above, the BUS would manage the scarcity value of money, extending private credit when appropriate. Clay called his plan the “American System.” ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2324))
- Jackson’s Democracy, like Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans before him, balked at national economic planning. In the end, no positive system of national economic policy resulted from the rise of American democracy. ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2330))
- The American System violated the Jacksonian principle of “equal rights.” In tandem with commercial growth—and in particular with the growth of the U.S. financial system—the period saw increasing economic inequality.8 The Democracy blamed government, attributing the inequality to the federal government’s favoring of elite economic interests. The publicly chartered and subsidized BUS, by allocating credit to its chosen favorites, was by definition a “corrupt” violator of equal rights. A tariff favoring northern manufacturers, at the expense of southern consumers of British manufactures, also played favorites. For the same reason, the Democracy was suspicious of public investment in… ([Location 2332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2332))

- Another result was the emergence of a distinctively American, anti-elitist, proto-populist, and pro-commercial politics of “antimonopoly.” Antimonopoly required equality of commercial opportunity and therefore prohibitions on “corrupt” government patronage and favoritism. Dramatically, Jackson killed off the BUS. In individual states, the Democracy led a social movement for democratic “open access” to incorporation.

- The U.S. Supreme Court in Fletcher v. Peck (1810) and Johnson v. M’Intosh (1823), cases involving disputed land claims, abetted speculator and squatter rights under the doctrine of “improvement.” Those rulings secured private property rights, which instilled popular expectations about the likely commercial benefits of future western colonization.

The “Creek Cession” was the crescent-shaped strip roughly three hundred miles long and twenty-five miles across, descending from the southwestern corner of Tennessee, down through central Mississippi (statehood, 1817) and across Alabama (1819).

- was true that the cotton boom had been led by misinvestment. Credit concentrated on cotton, at the expense of other enterprises, and the rapid expansion of western settlement had pushed ahead of political institutions, including transportation infrastructure. Instead, the United States needed a larger “home market” to ensure effective demand. Only it could be an adequate “vent for the surplus produce of our labor.”35 This was an old mercantilist principle, translated by Clay into a national setting. Likewise, such a national market would be the conscious creation of public policy. ([Location 2486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2486))
- Improvement was the old Enlightenment ideal, which defined private property rights in a reciprocal relationship to a larger public benefit. To make private property valuable, further improvements in public infrastructure were necessary. With the exception of the National Road—inaugurated at Cumberland, Maryland, on the Potomac River in 1811 and finally reaching the Ohio River in 1818—Congress had funded only one-off projects: a road from Athens, Georgia, to New Orleans (1806), say, or from Shawneetown, Ohio, to Kaskaskia, Illinois (1816). In 1816 Clay had tried to use the $1.5 million “bonus,” which the Second BUS paid to the federal government in return for its charter, to invest in a national system of internal improvements, but Madison had vetoed it on constitutional grounds. “If Congress can make canals,” a North Carolina congressman chimed in, “they can with more propriety emancipate” the enslaved.

- Gravitating to his dark horse candidacy were supporters of the national war hero, as well as squatters and speculators who eyed Indian and western lands. He also attracted elites who did not support Clay’s American System—chiefly slaveholders who feared expansive federal governmental power and hated the tariff that taxed their consumption of British goods.44 They wanted “free trade” and saw nothing wrong with the post-1815 cotton boom except for its bust.

- Finally, another constituency projected its views onto General Jackson, a group that shared in common a sense of grievance against cosmopolitan national elites, which Clay, Calhoun, and Adams undoubtedly were.46 With roots in the Jeffersonian mobilization, the enduring, emotionally pitched American populist tradition first appeared. ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2545))
- The Democracy’s populist supporters included rural white heads of household who lived off the commercial grid and feared, probably correctly, that Clay’s national program of internal improvements might connect urban mercantile elites but bypass them. His supporters also included the urban “mechanic interest,” independent proprietors of small-scale manufacturing. If large-scale manufacturers thrived under Clay’s proposed tariff, such men might find themselves as downwardly mobile “dependent” wage earners. Jackson’s Democracy supporters also included critics of the Second BUS, who believed insider control of money and credit undermined their own aspirations for commercial greatness. And they included critics of the state-level incorporation process of banks and other joint-stock companies, who charged state lawmakers with bestowing corporate privileges upon themselves and their friends. ([Location 2550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2550))

- The Cherokees had signed treaties that explicitly acknowledged sovereign possession of their ancestral lands. They had adopted commercial agriculture, including black slavery, had written a tribal constitution, and in many cases had converted to Christianity. The citizens of Georgia were not placated. They attacked anyway. Jackson supported and signed the Removal Act of 1830. It appropriated half a million dollars for the War Department to remove all Indians east of the Mississippi, and it granted Jackson the authority to exchange lands east of the Mississippi for lands west. Indian removal was slow, violent, and tragic. ([Location 2577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2577))
- The Missouri-based Bingham, a political Whig, offered this explanation of his painting: “The Squatters as a class, are not fond of the toil of agriculture, but erect their rude cabins upon those remote portions of the national domain, when the abundant game supplies their phisical [sic] wants. When this source of subsistence becomes diminished in consequence of increasing settlements around they usually sell out their slight improvement, with their ‘preemption title’ to the land, and again follow the receding footsteps of the Savage.” ([Location 2589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2589))

- At the same time, Biddle curried government favor. He used BUS funds to support the campaigns of politicians friendly to the bank. He made loans to editors of important newspapers. He granted loans to congressmen, on poor security, that sometimes went unpaid. He kept Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster, for instance, on a permanent legal retainer. Once, Webster wrote to Biddle, “my retainer has not been renewed, or refreshed, as usual. If it be wished that my relation to the Bank be continued, it may be well to send me the usual retainer.”59 Should such an arrangement appear “corrupt,” it is because one is looking at it through the eyes of the Jacksonian Democracy. Biddle, Webster, and Clay saw nothing wrong with the BUS simultaneously benefiting both the public good and their private bottom lines, at once. That was the essence of political economy.

- The president ended the bank veto with stirring words. “It is to be regretted,” Jackson lamented, “that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.” For: In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers—who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government.

- In order to legally secure open access to commerce, a Jacksonian jurisprudence developed that was solicitous of private property rights but hostile to any “special” or “class” legislation.67 Sphering public from private did not mean that state power, in its proper constitutionally limited domain, must be weak. Far from it. The Democratic Party built a more public and professional state bureaucracy.68 Under the banner of “antimonopoly,” New York and other cities deregulated their public food markets. But other utilities, like municipal waterworks, became exclusively public and state operated.69 Jacksonians acknowledged public regulation and state “police power” at the local level. In all instances, Jacksonian political economy gave rise to a new concern for boundary policing between public governance and private commerce.

- The political-economic settlement of the Empire of Liberty remained fundamentally grounded in a politics of property ownership among white heads of household, and Jackson was determined to keep it that way. Land improvements remained the largest category of productive investment.71 The organic economy still set limits on production and on the extent of markets—with bad roads and nonnavigable rivers. A large number of households, most of which supported Jackson, remained nearly off the commercial grid. ([Location 2703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2703))

- Jackson’s second term coincided with another credit-fueled boom of Smithian growth, made possible by government infrastructural projects that assisted the continued white colonization of Indian lands.

Boston and Providence became diversified manufacturing centers, while rural New England towns specialized in textiles, boots, and shoes. Connecticut towns manufactured tinware, buttons, spoons, plates, clocks, and hats. New York City became the “readymade” clothing center. The commercial economy of the Northeast, more dominated by local trade, enjoyed higher growth rates than even the cotton South.

- Even as Jacksonianism gridlocked the federal government, a state-government-led “transportation revolution” in market infrastructure facilitated commerce. All told, between 1787 and 1860, the federal government would invest $54 million on transportation infrastructure, whereas the states collectively made public investments of $450 million.

- The history began as far back as the 1790s, when many states, northeastern ones especially, had chartered joint-stock turnpike corporations. Before, roads were commonly poor paths carved through forests, often by citizens laboring to “work off” their tax obligations. ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2743))
- Between 1800 and 1830, the New England and Middle Atlantic states chartered almost one thousand turnpike corporations. They charged tolls, but few were profitable. Ordinary rural investors did not always invest to make a profit, it seems. Instead, they paid for a public good that was also of great private benefit: market access.

- The Erie Canal connected Lake Erie, through Buffalo, to Albany on the Hudson River, across 363 miles. The canal’s middle section opened in 1819, and tolls funded its completion by 1825. Upstate New York wheat production immediately prospered. Rochester, with 1,500 inhabitants in 1821, counted 10,000 a decade later.

- New York City, which had captured the southern cotton transshipment trade, now expanded to include goods from its upstate agricultural hinterlands, becoming the Empire of Liberty’s undoubted commercial colossus.

- In the Southwest, where public infrastructure lagged, state debt sales capitalized state-chartered joint-stock banking corporations. Often slave mortgages were the assets pledged as collateral for public debts, or as capital stock. ([Location 2781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2781))
- The United States was a fast-growing developing economy, absorbing funds from Britain, which was then undergoing industrial revolution and was the world center of capital accumulation. British capital chased expected gains from the extension of the North American ([Location 2784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2784))
- Instead, financial panics erupted in 1837 and 1839. After Jackson refused to recharter the BUS, the Bank War between him and his organized political opponents—who called themselves the Whig Party, referring to the revolutionary generation’s opposition to unchecked monarchical power—dominated the late 1830s. ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2801))
- The chief cause of the expansion of money and credit in this period was that U.S. hard-currency reserves had increased, backing the multiplying banknote issues. In particular, silver mined in Mexico had swelled U.S. hard-currency reserves. Due to the British opium trade in Asia, this silver no longer flowed to China to finance Anglo-American transactions. It stayed in the United States, backing further domestic credit issues.90 In all this, however, the financial flywheel was the Bank of England. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2810))
- When the Bank of England raised the bank rate, much capital swung out of the United States and back into Great Britain. The higher bank rate was attractive, and with money and credit more dear, across the chain of indebtedness creditors began to call in loans, to meet their payments. In the United States, money and credit began to tighten. Thus prices fell, including the price of cotton. Anglo-American mercantile houses that were invested in the cotton trade, carrying stocks, began to wobble. Some failed. The New Orleans and New York City banks that lent to them suffered from loans gone sour. Sensing trouble at the banks, depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits, and redeem their notes for hard currency. ([Location 2819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2819))
- But the catching of the developing U.S. economy in the snares of capital markets governed by the British bank rate was the ultimate cause of the bust. Money and credit tightened, and spending dried up. It was the third debt-deflation slump in national history.

- 1841–42 Louisiana, Maryland, Illinois, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Mississippi, Indiana, and the Florida Territory all entered default. Ohio and New York barely escaped. ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2836))
- An international financial system premised on a currency pegged to a fixed hard-currency value can sufficiently anchor investor confidence and expectations to recruit scarce capital into a developing economy—in this case, the United States. But when the hegemonic center—in this case, London—raises the interest rate to maintain the hard-currency standard, given prior outflows to the periphery, capital can suddenly swing out, stopping credit and collapsing prices. A global credit cycle comes to an end. ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2838))
- In 1838 New York State passed “free banking” legislation. Its advocates called it a “great and admirable improvement on the corrupting political monopoly it superseded.”99 Meeting universal reserve requirements, any citizen of New York State might charter a bank. During the 1840s many states began to pass “general incorporation” laws for banking, manufacturing, and sometimes all enterprise. Some states banned “special” chartering altogether. General incorporation would not triumph until the 1870s. But the trend was now afoot.100 By 1860, eighteen states had passed free banking laws, inaugurating the “free banking era.” Corporate charters proliferated in the tens of thousands, and corporations became uniquely American vehicles of association and enterprise. ([Location 2866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2866))
- General incorporation was a momentous change and a blow against elites in favor of equal rights and equal opportunity. The oldest legal theory of corporate personality was “grant” or “concession” theory. Only the sovereign could grant corporate charters, thereby creating a new subsovereign.102 In a democracy, however, where popular sovereignty reigned, grant theory was a contradiction. How could legislatures grant sovereignty back to “the people,” where it resided in the first place? Why should the privileges of incorporation not be a democratic right, enjoyed equally by all? ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2873))
- After the Panic of 1839 sovereign debt crisis came a Jacksonian revulsion against state-funded internal improvements. States ceased to invest in private corporate stock and began to tax property to raise revenue instead.103 This was another instance of Jacksonian sphering in political economy, an attempt, at once ideological and legal, to delimit the private commercial sphere from state infringement. ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2879))
- No corporations, not even joint-stock corporations, were legally mandated to pursue commercial profits to the exclusion of all other projects.105 The profit-maximizing corporation, familiar to the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, had not arrived yet on the scene, and there would first be much experimentation with the corporate form, which was still quite malleable. ([Location 2887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2887))
- The project to demarcate a private, market sphere had the effect of crippling any attempt to provide long-term political direction to the ongoing process of commercialization. ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2894))
- Americans in Thoreau’s day had lived through a series of credit-fueled commercial booms followed by financial panics and debt-deflation slumps. But soon after the twin Panics of 1837 and 1839, the commercial economy roared back to life, and many, not only Thoreau, felt that commerce was beginning to impinge on economic life, even just on life, in ways that it had not before. Commercial self-interest was jumping outside its age-old checks, be they moral disapprobation or a nonnavigable river, and conjuring a world of its own. The market extended indeed, boring into Americans’ very beings. Not only political economy but social and cultural life, and even psychological and ethical life, appeared to be at stake. What kind of society was a “commercial society”? What kind of person succeeded or failed in it? What did ever more commerce do to the human soul? ([Location 2909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2909))
- Adam Smith had said that commercial dynamism should come not from the state but from the universal spring of “human nature.” Smith had thought a lot about human nature in The Wealth of Nations (1776), and in his equally brilliant and edifying The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), he explained that a commercial society required of its members a particular kind of ethics in order to flourish: the bourgeois virtues of honesty, prudence, and respect.3 Smith analogized them to friendship. ([Location 2916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2916))
- Commerce was premised on self-interest but required sympathy to function. There might be ethical tensions, but commerce presupposed a willingness to bargain, within agreed-on conventions of value and representation, without resorting to violence. ([Location 2920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2920))
- Perhaps the adequate regulation of commercial self-interest did not need a supervening state authority, as the mercantilists had believed, or even moral exhortation in the tradition of the “just price.” All it needed was what we call proper “business ethics” today. ([Location 2933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2933))
- What if human beings in a commercial society, instead of hacking each other to death, haggle with each other in order to live, but treat each other falsely, as instrumental means to their own future personal commercial ends? What if they are all artificial and inauthentic liars, merely trying to turn a buck? With so much commerce buzzing in their ears, many antebellum American writers and artists were obsessed with this dilemma, worries that commercial appearances had swallowed reality and that life was becoming nothing more than a confidence game. ([Location 2943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2943))
- if there is no confidence or trust, then there can be no commerce. Hoarding trust can be as dangerous as hoarding capital. The cost in both instances is an absence of investment in the future. Wisely, Hamilton had warned of the ill economic effects of “cautious sagacious capitalists.” ([Location 2955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2955))
- Over the centuries, every single financial crisis there has ever been has been a crisis of confidence. Why is capitalism so dependent on interpersonal trust and the psychological state of confidence? When Americans panicked during the Panic of 1837, after all, they literally panicked.12 Why is capitalism always a bit of a confidence game? ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2958))
- Thoreau and Melville wrote during the period of literary history that scholars call the American Renaissance. A period of just seven years saw the publication of Emerson’s Nature; Addresses and Lectures (1849), Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter (1850), Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Thoreau’s Walden (1854), Frederick Douglass’s My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass (1855), and Margaret Fuller’s (posthumous) At Home and Abroad (1856). Poe was publishing short stories, and Emily Dickinson was writing poetry. It was thought to be the beginning of self-consciously democratic American literary expression, but in hindsight it was a peak.

- New York City, having dethroned Boston and Philadelphia and fended off a challenge from New Orleans, had become the great national urban hub of trade. It was home to the southern cotton transshipment trade and also the entrepôt for the Erie Canal. Between 1840 and 1860, the city’s population climbed from 312,710 to 813,669. Urbanization came late to America, but had finally begun. In 1840 the urban share of the U.S. population was 11 percent. By 1860, it had almost doubled to 20 percent, from 2 million to 6 million persons. ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=2990))
- The era of “free banking,” or open access to bank incorporation, in many individual states had begun. True, the states created banking commissions to regulate banknote issues and shore up confidence, but nonetheless banks issued paper notes of a value greater than their hard-currency reserves. It worked only if there was confidence and trust in their paper. ([Location 3011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3011))
- Just as, shrewdly, Barnum did not claim to be an authority on his own humbugs, the world of paper money no longer had a central authority to tell anyone whether what they saw had authentic value. After Jackson killed off the Second Bank of the United States, interpersonal trust and credit became even more a basis of what Hamilton had called “pecuniary capital.” Farmers had their land; slave owners had their slaves. But tradesmen had trust, and without trust, instead of constant credit creation, a final reckoning would arrive—the moment when all debts came due. If it did arrive, the result would be bank runs and financial panics. ([Location 3014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3014))
- By design, the system did not have enough hard currency to pay off all debt. Present truths were insufficient to compensate for the future fictions. Because a capitalist financial system is a perpetual leap of faith, over and over again, confidence becomes the emotional and psychological mainspring of economic activity. ([Location 3018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3018))
- What was there to limit or check the radical uncertainty of commerce? Tellingly, who was not inside the American Museum? What noncommercial forms of authority were absent from the scene? No king, no politician, and certainly no central banker was present to distinguish appearance from reality. The American Museum was no family farm—no father was there to decide, no slave master was present. And God? ([Location 3036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3036))
- The same Lewis Tappan of the mercantile credit agency hired out the chapel to Charles Finney, the most popular evangelical preacher of the day, in the ongoing Second Great Awakening. Finney himself was something of a showman. He said your soul’s salvation was your own responsibility. You, not God, had to decide if you wanted to be saved, trusting in your own will—a stark departure from the Calvinist orthodoxy of Puritan New England, which insisted that only God was truth, only God was real, only God knew and could be trusted to know the true state of your soul, including whether you would go to heaven after the final day of reckoning. Finney announced that you got to choose whether you were saved. ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3039))
- The family resemblance between the leap-of-faith capitalist credit system and Finney’s leap-of-faith theology is evident. Neither has a transcendent authority. If you did not take the leap and have confidence, you would not be saved spiritually. Also, the capitalist financial system might implode. ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3044))
- A democratization of truth was happening inside the American Museum, which placed on individuals the democratic duty of making judgments. In the American political economy, neither Henry Clay’s American System, nor any other long-term political project of development, was directing commercial prosperity. The money and credit necessary to capitalize commerce and commercial production now bubbled up from below, in the form of democratic, interpersonal acts of trust, as well as a popular state of confidence and expectations. Arising from these excitements, doubts, and questions, emotional states and psychological drives fueled the speculative upswing in the credit cycle, which induced investment and pulled along commercial development. ([Location 3049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3049))
- Thoreau said that to find reality, even if just in your own conscious thoughts, you had to be able to leave behind the world of commercial squabbling. Ideally, you should seek nature, the world that leads to inner truths. The process should be organic. Keeping a journal helped, because that way you were in conversation with yourself and not with others. Or talk with good friends. Thoreau believed that his own experience of his independent thoughts, if he could only have them, was all that was real. Everything else was appearance and could not be trusted. ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3068))
- In the American political tradition, the Jeffersonian idiom was critical less of the market than of dependence on particular markets, whether stock markets or public debt markets. After all, Jefferson was a utopian about the geopolitical possibilities of “free trade.” Jeffersonian republicanism had translated into a Jacksonian democratic rhetoric that was even more suspicious of privilege and oligarchy. Nevertheless, a large Jacksonian constituency was mostly critical of monopoly and positively yearned for equality of commercial opportunity. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3075))
- In contrast to timeworn religious counsels about the perils of too much commerce and also to the Jeffersonian critique of possible market dependence, Walden was part of a new, transatlantic intellectual movement, known as romanticism, that had grown suspicious of capitalist commercialization altogether. The Romantics feared that the heartless world of commercial appearances was overtaking reality. ([Location 3078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3078))
- the critical social commentary of Charles Dickens in his later novels such as Hard Times (1854) is far different from his comic but sympathetic depictions of commercial man in the early lighter novels like The Pickwick Papers (1836). The intellectual tide among the children of the rising bourgeoisie, by the 1850s, had begun to move against capitalist commerce. ([Location 3100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3100))
- A century later, in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (1942), the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter would note the tendency of capitalism to provide the material abundance necessary for intellectuals to have the time and leisure to criticize it. ([Location 3103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3103))
- Like Smith, Emerson and Thoreau both celebrated friendship. Unlike Smith, following Kant, both underscored friendship’s noncommercial, noninstrumental qualities. Commerce did not civilize, it did not tame the worst human passions. Rather, it coarsened the human heart and undermined the possibility of intimacy and trust. ([Location 3116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3116))
- In Walden’s scathing first chapter, “Economy,” Thoreau addressed Concord’s farmers. But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. ([Location 3125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3125))
- Thoreau did not believe in the commercializing farmer’s limitless quest for more and more. Specialization and the division of labor, rather than increasing the wealth of nations, turned everyone into but “the ninth part of a man.”37 The accusation gets to the heart of “transcendentalism.” Thomas Jefferson had celebrated the republican virtue of independence, premised on the private ownership and control of landed property, wealth, and capital. Land had to be owned, and worked, for the feeling of independence to come about. For Thoreau, no private property outside one’s own being could adequately ground independence and autonomy. ([Location 3142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3142))
- American democracy had become false because outward commercial appearances had triumphed over inner realities. The gap between the two had grown so great that reality could no longer even be represented by appearance. ([Location 3159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3159))
- In the end, Thoreau’s argument was that capitalist commerce was incompatible with democratic life. The freedom to choose whether the Feejee Mermaid was a humbug could not be freedom. There must be something deeper within us to democratically cultivate. ([Location 3171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3171))
- To Herman Melville, Thoreau’s transcendentalism was a moral tyrant. Melville also recognized that many moral checks on commerce were fading fast, and he was worried, too, but he came to think differently from Thoreau about the morality of capitalist commerce. Rather than celebrating the market or pushing back against its always-corrosive effects, Melville wondered if commercial investment might be appropriated as a means toward a morally worthy end. ([Location 3178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3178))
- The term confidence man, however, appears to be of American vintage. In 1849 a man named William Thompson was apprehended in Manhattan for larceny. Thompson’s con was to stroll up alongside a passerby and ask, “Have you confidence in me to trust me with your watch until to-morrow?” Thompson collected more than a few watches in this way before he was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment in Sing Sing. Shortly after his arrest, a play, The Confidence Man, ran in New York. A writer in The Knickerbocker argued that Thompson was no worse than the typical Wall Street tradesman. ([Location 3194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3194))
- Melville purchased a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, next to an old family estate. On the side, he became a working farmer, planting corn and potatoes. When Moby-Dick—arguably the greatest American novel—was published, it was a commercial flop. ([Location 3202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3202))
- Historically, the best measure of capitalism’s presence may not be the presence of its many defining features—capital, market activity, technological innovation, wage labor, or something else. All these things have existed to greater or lesser degrees for a long time, even if just at the margins. What defines capitalism’s presence, rather, is not a presence but a relative absence. In the United States, the Age of Commerce had arrived at a point where it made sense for Melville to ask the following question, and to write an entire novel mulling over it: What would happen if economic life—nay, life itself—were nothing more than a running series of commercial transactions in pursuit of future pecuniary gain? ([Location 3224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3224))
- The Confidence-Man’s fictional steamship Fidele has no kings, aristocrats, peasants, or lords. There are no families, no households, no fathers, sons, or daughters. There are no masters, and there are no slaves. The characters have no histories. The state is absent, and so is legal authority. Even the stability of the land is absent. The entire novel takes place on the Mississippi River, as commerce then often followed the waterways. On the Fidele, nothing happens at all besides commercial bargaining. Commerce itself is the warp and woof of human relationships. ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3230))
- On the Fidele, there is a pervasive sense of estrangement and distrust. The passengers, Melville never tires of telling us, are all “strangers.” Melville used the word stranger no fewer than sixty times in The Confidence-Man. ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3239))
- On the Fidele, loneliness breeds not self-knowledge and independence but “melancholy” and “depression.”50 Individuals are too immersed in commercial transactions even to recognize themselves once they are removed from them. There is no longer any fixed point outside commerce, no law, no God, no self, no reality, no truth. Is it all humbug? We have no independent standpoint left from which to even tell! The Confidence-Man is a novel whose main protagonist is doubt. Doubts experienced by the characters; doubts experienced by the reader trying to unravel the layers of the seeming hoax. Melville wrote the greatest of all highbrow humbugs. ([Location 3259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3259))
- the moral universe presented in The Confidence-Man is somewhat terrifying. Everyone is a confidence man, and everything is a confidence game. It is all skin and no meat. A sense for truth succumbs to a deep skepticism. If full withdrawal from commerce breeds only lethargy and melancholy and no social intercourse whatsoever, what is left beyond loneliness? What is left, it would seem, is an even more terrifying nothingness, a true existential “falsity,” to return to Thoreau. ([Location 3265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3265))
- The miser’s misery is a moral lesson. In a commercial society, anyone who hoards his confidence—refusing to trust others—is isolated and miserable. He is no wise transcendentalist, sitting peacefully and calmly at Walden Pond keeping a journal by himself. In fact, he is pathologically ill. Melville saw the transcendental retreat from commercial society as miserly, in a moral sense. He seems to have been saying that social appearances must sometimes be embraced for there even to be a reality. Perhaps commercial society had put the metaphysical cart before the horse. But there was no going back. The only thing left to do was grab the cart and pull it oneself, constructing ourselves moral values—uncertain ethical investments, but still ones that might bear fruit. ([Location 3284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3284))
- By contrast, panicked and anxious, the miser has nearly lost his mind and can only speak gibberish. It is better to take the leap, and trust the confidence man, including our own inner confidence man. That way there is commerce, and also, Melville hints, life and meaning itself in a commercial society. ([Location 3289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3289))
- His analysis was correct: the capitalist credit cycle of boom and bust, only just emerging in his day, is motivated by a contradictory drive of speculative investment. The contradiction consists in the fact that while credit-fueled and energetic speculation can lead to genuine capitalist investment booms, instigating wealth-generating enterprise, individuals can also succumb to the temptations of short-term speculation alone, in which, benefiting from the transactional liquidity of capital markets, they simply move their bets in and out of assets, confidently seeking only short-term gain. ([Location 3299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3299))
- But speculations may not fix on objects of investment long enough for long-term economic development to happen. Capital just spins its top. And the speculative desire to leave all potential investment options open is only a fantasy. For if all options are kept open, but never exercised, nothing actually ever happens. ([Location 3303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3303))
- Next, should confidence collapse, the miser may reappear. Out of fear, the miser will not spend for any reason, let alone speculate short term—let alone invest. Thus the final contradiction is that the attributes of money capital make possible in equal measure both speculation and precaution, both confident booms and depressed slumps. ([Location 3306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3306))
- Melville illustrates how either obsessive speculation or obsessive precaution can undermine the kind of long-term committed investment necessary to create durable, worthy values—existential values, shared ethical values, economic values.

- Melville’s miser, hoarding the hard currency of gold for precautionary rather than speculative reasons, is the most liquid. He keeps all future options, all desires, all possible future speculations, open and alive. Yet by continuing to hoard pathologically, the miser never exercises any of his options. Death will come to him before any enjoyment in life does. Hoarding and speculation are of the same complex. ([Location 3311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3311))
- Later, in the twentieth century, the miser would reappear, taking center stage in the most incisive economic study of hoarding, the English economist John Maynard Keynes’s The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), written in the midst of the Great Depression.53 Unlike Marx, Keynes thought about capital in terms not of past accumulation but of future “expectations.” He coined the phrase liquidity preference to capture the propensities of the owners of capital to either in the short term speculate in liquid financial assets or cling to money with excessive precaution, both at the cost of long-term committed investment and economic development.

- In capitalist credit markets, the maintenance of transactional liquidity is an institutional problem. Today it is the preserve of central banks. In Melville’s time, the Bank of England’s power to set short-term interest rates affected liquidity on both sides of the Atlantic.

- There is a moral antidote for “No Trust!,” however, that pivots the analysis from the psychological back to the social register. The antidote is friendship. ([Location 3332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3332))
- Friendship was a central ethical theme of commercial society, discussed by all sides in the debate over the moral worth of commerce. Barnum, in his autobiography, spoke often of his friends; Smith celebrated friendship in The Theory of Moral Sentiments; Hegel viewed friendship as the quintessence of freedom; Emerson’s great essay on friendship appeared in Essays: First Series (1841); the Hudson River School master Asher Brown Durand’s painting Kindred Spirits (1849) pictured Durand with his friend and fellow painter Thomas Cole; Thoreau included a beautiful essay on friendship in his A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849); his poem “Friendship” (1838) spoke of “Two sturdy oaks.” ([Location 3334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3334))
- The Confidence-Man takes up the topic of friendship explicitly in Chapter 39, “The Hypothetical Friends.” The “stranger” who approaches the confidence man Frank Goodman is a cross between a “Yankee peddler” and a “Tartar priest” and turns out to be the mystic Mark Winsome, a thinly veiled Ralph Waldo Emerson, if only because tagging along with him is a disciple, Eggbert, who is even more obviously Thoreau. ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3344))
- Disguising their names, Melville used Emerson and Thoreau to express the rising Victorian sentiment that commerce cannot be trusted. Unfeeling and heartless, it must be kept within its proper sphere. A hard wall must always separate the market from the warm sentiments of friendship and family. The market is always pushing against its own boundaries, threatening to corrode other spheres, and must be vigilantly walled off from them. ([Location 3356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3356))
- But must one oppose markets and morals?58 Doing so, Melville suggested, lets markets off the moral hook while diminishing morality. There is another path, though one tinged with risk: to attempt to appropriate capital’s pecuniary motion toward worthy, nonpecuniary ends. ([Location 3359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3359))
- If transcendentalism forbids financial assistance among friends, it becomes a moral tyrant. Capitalism may be premised on uncertainty, warranting skepticism, but uncertainty need not undermine genuine moral values and commitments. A pragmatic ethical hope is possible. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3364))
- Furthermore, human beings are not self-sufficient, or at least stoic independence is a weak premise for true friendship. We are friends with one another because, as human beings, we are dependent on one another. Thoreau, hoarding his confidence, is lampooned in The Confidence-Man as an ethical miser. A world without “confidence,” Melville wrote, was both “solitary” and “dehumanized.” ([Location 3367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3367))

- Much as in the eighteenth-century British Empire, in the nineteenth-century Empire of Liberty, the owners of capital confidently invested in the long-term expectation of racial slavery’s future extension across space.

- Throughout American history, however, enslaved black people were capital assets.11 Certain matters were settled by the final cotton boom of the 1840s and ’50s. As Karl Marx put it, in a passage from the posthumously published volume three of Capital (1894): “The price that is paid here for the slave…is no more than the anticipated and capitalized surplus-value or profit that is to be extracted from him.”12 Since the profit motive is never enough, however, many motivations combined to determine the going price of a slave.13 Altogether, the white inducement to invest in black slaves was extraordinary.

- In the well-developed southern capital market, enslaved persons, as property, were legally alienable, thus acquiring the attribute of transactional liquidity.

- The average price of a slave in 1850 was $300. In 1860 it was $800, while a “prime” field hand in New Orleans fetched $1,800.

- The bullish expectations priced into black slave capital markets say something about slavery’s presumed fate as late as 1860.

- Enslaved people acquired many of the qualities of other capital assets. They were the object of private property rights, and they had the attributes of alienability and expected future pecuniary gain. At the same time, as capital assets, they possessed a number of unique economic qualities. First and foremost, enslaved persons were “portable.” Enslaved capital could be coerced to move across space, which was one reason why, during the Age of Commerce, slavery was such a dynamic factor in economic expansion.20 Land cannot be physically moved, and industrial plant and machinery were far more… ([Location 3480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3480))

- Between 1820 and 1860, about 875,000 slaves left the upper South for the lower South in a massive forced migration.23 That was twice the number of African slaves brought to North America before the closing of the U.S. slave trade in 1808, and eight times as many as moved from the upper to the lower South between 1790 and 1820. Probably 60 to 70 percent of the movement came from an internal slave trade. ([Location 3503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3503))
- Brazil and Cuba had domestic slave markets, but nowhere else in the Americas was there an interregional slave market like in the United States.

- Planters developed a metric, “bales per hand,” to track, assess, and improve slave effort. Thomas Affleck’s Plantation Record and Account Book (1847) sold widely during the 1850s and helped planters keep numerical records.30 The threat of sale coerced labor, as did the snap of the cat-o’-nine tails, the blunt force of the cowhide paddle, and the lacerating bullwhip. Violence was probably worse on the cotton frontier, where planters were more indebted and had more acreage in cotton.

- Last but not least, during the 1830s planters imported a new strain of cottonseed from Mexico, known as “Petit Gulf.” The best statistical analysis attributes the largest share of productivity gains in the period thereafter to its spread and breeding—biological “improvement.”31 ([Location 3531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3531))

- Commodity booms dependent upon foreign demand can make regions that are integrated well into global markets rich, but they do have stark developmental limits—lacking, for instance, the increasing returns born of either a local Smithian commercial multiplier or the knock-on effects of industrial investment.37 The plantation economy, for instance, failed to commercially… ([Location 3554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3554))
- The best way to understand the U.S. slave economy is this way: riding the upswings and the downswings of the speculative credit cycle, white slave owners progressively squeezed every productivity gain possible out of the scarce resources of an organic economy, whether that meant extracting kinetic energy from the bodies of enslaved men and women, colonizing the most ecologically fertile soils, or biologically innovating crop seeds.

- Please, Hammond instructed his legitimate white son Harry in 1856, “Do not let Louisa or any of my children or possible children be slaves of Strangers. Slavery in the family will be their happiest earthly condition.”42 No eighteenth-century U.S. slave master would likely have written such sentences to himself or his children. Hammond espoused a reconfigured, white supremacist slaveholding ideology, rooted in the familial intimacies of the plantation household—paternalism. ([Location 3574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3574))
- What most changed in the South after 1840 was not so much the economy. The dynamics of the post–Panic of 1837 cotton boom were quite similar to those before. What was new was the rise of a paternalistic slaveholding ideology that was professedly inimical to unchecked commerce. American slave capitalism transformed due to paternalism’s triumph. ([Location 3578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3578))
- What historians call “paternalism” in this context was an unlikely nineteenth-century Christian “insurgency” to reform the most draconian aspects of slavery.44 Paternalism had two core features. ([Location 3582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3582))
- First, in a departure from common eighteenth-century beliefs that equated enslavement with attempted animalization, paternalism professed to acknowledge the “humanity” of enslaved blacks but nonetheless still considered them racially inferior. “Our slaves,” insisted James Henley Thornwell, an important professor of theology in Columbia, South Carolina, “are moral beings.”45 Unlike many masters before, paternalists welcomed the religious conversion of their slaves to Christianity. They rejected the patriarchal slaveholding ideology—the harsh, distant rule of the father over his subjects—of colonial North America and instead promoted the “Abrahamic” kind, in which master-slave relations should be more intimate and affective. God’s law checked the master’s dominion. ([Location 3584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3584))
- Second, paternalism cast southern home life in the Victorian moral light of domestic sentiment. Black slaves were not just members of households, or economic units. They were members of families, emotionally speaking. William A. Smith, president of Randolph-Macon College, captured the essential idea in his Lectures on the Philosophy and Practice of Slavery (1856). “Domestic slavery,” he proclaimed, “is made part of the family relation. The head of the family is the master, and the slave is subject…as the other members of the family.” ([Location 3590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3590))
- After the closing of the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, slave owners could no longer replenish their capital stock from abroad. Slave capital would have to reproduce itself sexually, as white masters grew ever more dependent on the reproductive labors of black women. Between 1790 and 1860, the U.S. slave population doubled every twenty-eight years, an increase of 2.5 percent per annum.48 In addition to “portability,” positive fertility was a second unique characteristic of enslaved human capital, compared to other forms of capital. ([Location 3596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3596))
- The aftermath of the Panic of 1837 was the next decisive economic event. Suffering from debt-deflation, many masters decided to make their plantations more economically self-sufficient and to rely less on commercial markets for foodstuffs. They would still rely on market demand for cotton, but would rely less on markets for the supply of some plantation necessities. The full-fledged U.S. “cotton and corn” system arose—distinct from the older, more cash-crop-oriented West Indian model—in which masters put sufficient acreage into corn to meet the plantation’s basic subsistence needs. This new “safety first” strategy was thus a check on commercial risk. ([Location 3602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3602))
- There was a capitalist logic to this shift. For the final characteristic of enslaved capital is its “fixed” quality. If, on the one hand, slaves were relatively liquid, because they traded easily in markets and were objects of speculation, they were also illiquid, in the sense that over time their value depreciated, whether because of backbreaking labor or age.49 In this strict sense, enslaved human capital was like a rusting, depreciating factory. Further, once a slave was owned, the cost of maintaining them—providing food, clothing, and care—continued to run, just as a factory might rust with age regardless of its use. For this reason, a market and a law for the renting of slave labor emerged.50 In other words, the cost of slave ownership was what economists call “sunk.” ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3607))
- Every idle hour for every slave was a carried cost. Cotton was a seasonal crop, with annual spring planting and fall harvesting seasons. Its cultivation could not occupy every single waking hour of every slave’s life. Idle time became filled with subsistence production. In 1850, on U.S. cotton plantations, 38 percent of the average slave’s labor time was devoted to cotton, but 31 percent went into corn and the care of livestock, with most production by far directly consumed on the plantation. Another 31 percent went into tending other subsistence items (like potatoes and peas), home manufacturing of… ([Location 3614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3614))
- Slave children entered the workforce at age three or four (becoming household servants or joining “trash gangs”) and began producing a surplus above their own consumption for their masters by, on average, age nine.

- paternalists lapped up the same transatlantic, romantic critique of commerce as did Emerson and Thoreau but spun something different of it.55 Here, among the slave master’s newly fashioned “domestic” Christian duties and burdens, none was more publicly celebrated than the need to provide for slaves’ basic subsistence—apart from commerce. In paternalist ideology, the moral split between heartless commerce and domestic familial affection became sharp. Thus a particular economic logic of investment, given that slaves represented running and fixed costs, led to a large plantation household subsistence sector,… ([Location 3632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3632))
- Perhaps the classic economic distillation of paternalism was made by E. N.

In 1857 President James Buchanan told Congress in his first annual message, “The relation between master and slave and a few others are ‘domestic institutions,’ and are entirely distinct from institutions of a political character.”58 That meant the federal government, in addition to having no right to expropriate southern private property, had no right to intervene in southern private family life. The shift, in fact, resonated with the… ([Location 3659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3659))

- rising slave prices had led to the concentration of holdings and to an increased southern economic income inequality—perhaps one reason why, by the 1840s, income growth in the North was outstripping that of the South.59 Non-slave-owning southern whites became vastly poorer than their northern counterparts.

- In the South, no matter what the paternalists said about commerce, the household remained the basic unit of enterprise. By contrast, in the North a rupture took place.

- Quantitatively, the greatest two-decade spurt of growth in U.S. industrial history occurred between 1840 and 1860. In the Northeast, industrial production increased 7.5… ([Location 3683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3683))
- In 1840 only 8.7 percent of the U.S. workforce was engaged in manufacturing. ([Location 3690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3690))
- Historian Thomas C. Cochran long ago explained: In early nineteenth-century America the machine spinning mill was of minor importance compared to the hard-surfaced road; the early steam engine was more significant for improvements in river transportation than in manufacturing; and iron puddling and rolling were far less vital to immediate progress than canals. ([Location 3691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3691))
- Given the Northeast’s dense commercial geography, manufacturing growth was a response to local and regional urban and rural demand.66 This was the case for, say, New England textiles and shoes, Connecticut clocks and brassware, upstate New York flour milling and cheese-making, New York City ready-made clothing, Trenton, New Jersey, ironware, and Philadelphia machines and stoves. ([Location 3696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3696))
- Transportation infrastructure was the key source of industrial expansion.67 By 1840, because of improved transportation due to state-backed internal improvements, geographically a coherent northeastern industrial corridor was rounding into shape. ([Location 3699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3699))
- Manufacturing clung to the waterways, as waterwheels transferred power to millstones by wooden shafts. Nearly everywhere in 1850, steam power cost more per unit of horsepower than did water.68 Large-scale manufacturing, when it occurred, took place in dispersed rural mills. ([Location 3703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3703))
- most U.S. manufacturing production by far involved the processing of organic materials—wheat, leather, wool, and cotton. Lumber was important, too, as construction inevitably dominated manufacturing in growing cities. Western colonization required rural construction materials as well, for houses, mills, barns, carriages, wheels, and furniture. Due to its abundance, wood—not iron, let alone steel—remained the leading construction material. ([Location 3715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3715))
- In 1840 the average U.S. manufacturing establishment employed but four workers.70 The household remained the dominant unit of industrial production. Small-scale proprietorships predominated. Productive capital requirements were low. Skilled labor was essential. ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3718))
- Inside the shops, employers and employees were “masters” and “servants.” Master “mechanics” employed “apprentices” and “journeymen,” former apprentices who aspired to be “independent” mechanics.72 Servants were legally bound to fulfill the contractual terms of employment, subject to the disciplinary authority of their masters. Home and work were often the same place. ([Location 3723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3723))
- In 1832 no less than 40 percent of the remunerated U.S. manufacturing workforce was women or children. They were all paid less to perform the same work as adult men. The larger the manufacturing establishment, and the larger the capital requirements, the more firms relied on unskilled female and child labor. In textile firms with more than fifteen employees, 73.4 percent of employees were women or girls.76 In large-scale cotton plantations and large-scale textile manufacturers alike, the labor of women and children was the key swing component. ([Location 3736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3736))
- But then, after roughly 1840, in the Northeast a different kind of industrialization clearly had begun. ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3742))
- By increasing the extent of markets and the demand for goods in city and countryside alike, the Smithian commercial multiplier had set the foundation for the emergence of an industrial investment multiplier. ([Location 3744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3744))
- Later estimates of productivity growth point to the 1850s as the moment of rupture.78 A new logic of greater fixed capital investment had appeared in industry.79 The “intensity” of productive capital in manufacturing—the value of industrial structures and equipment—relative to labor increased. Taking advantage of Jacksonian general incorporation laws, entrepreneurs chartered corporations to raise the capital and credit necessary to increase the scale of economic production. ([Location 3745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3745))
- Between 1840 and 1860, U.S. manufacturing employment tripled.80 By 1860, the average number of employees per manufacturing establishment had more than doubled from 1840, up to nine laborers (which almost reached the average size of a slave plantation, which was ten). ([Location 3750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3750))
- Scale increased beyond the household, as larger factories required a physical space separate from the home. There was greater demand for unskilled labor relative to skilled labor. Increasingly, rather than women and children, the U.S. labor pool consisted of 3.3 million European immigrants—mostly from Ireland and Germany—who arrived between 1847 and 1857.82 ([Location 3753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3753))
- Finally, during the 1850s, northern manufacturing pushed at the productive limits of the organic economy. Coal-fired steam engines began to power many lines of production. ([Location 3756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3756))
- The British government survey The American System of Manufactures (1855) took note of U.S. industry’s enduring distinctive features: the use of “standardized” components in manufacturing assembly; fast machine speeds; and greater work intensity. Altogether, in the Northeast in 1860, manufacturing labor productivity, or the amount of output wrested from the same input of labor, was likely higher than anywhere else in the world. ([Location 3758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3758))
- In the North, textile production had left the home.86 Machines and unskilled immigrant male labor replaced women and children. In one Lowell textile mill in 1836, immigrant male workers constituted only 4 percent of the labor force. By 1860, they accounted for 62 percent. ([Location 3764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3764))
- The status of waged work was changing greatly in the North. Rather than a household dependency, it was becoming a variety of free labor. Ideologically, wage work was transforming from a dependency associated with femininity to a badge of male independence. Legally, it transformed masters and servants into employers and employees with different sets of legal obligations. Notably, the free labor doctrines emerging in the United States were quite “radical” compared to those of other countries.90 They were not the foreordained endpoint of capitalist development. ([Location 3783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3783))
- The abolition of slavery in the North inaugurated the history of free labor there. New England abolished it first, in the midst of the Revolution or shortly thereafter.91 Elsewhere it took more time.92 A critical moment came when masters attempted to enroll emancipated slaves in long-term contracts as their servants. Northern legal decisions overturning these ruses undermined long-term contracts of all kinds, including even some forms of apprenticeship.93 Free labor required more than the abolition of involuntary servitude; it would also require the outlawing of many kinds of coercion and unfreedom in the workplace. ([Location 3788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3788))
- What emerged, slowly, was an American right to quit work, a doctrine formalized legally decades later as “employment at will.” Indentured servitude and legal punishments for “absconding from service” during the length of a labor contract fell by the wayside. Corporeal punishment of workers, even where and when it remained legal, was no longer practical, since workers, if beaten, often simply walked off the job—and demanded compensation for work already performed. ([Location 3795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3795))
- English common law clearly stated that compensation was for the performance of a “whole” of a contract, and in the United States, labor contracts, if not otherwise specified, were annual, a principle upheld in Massachusetts as late as Stark v. Parker (1824). ([Location 3798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3798))
- By roughly 1840, American wage workers enjoyed the legal right to quit at a moment’s notice and nonetheless to receive “part compensation” for work already performed. A labor market with a “norm of high mobility” emerged. ([Location 3800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3800))
- The changes cut two ways. U.S. wage earners gained new rights but lost long-term job security as employer obligations thinned out. Southern pro-slavery ideologues, defending paternalism, harped on the latter. ([Location 3802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3802))
- Meanwhile in the Northeast, in addition to sphering between market and state, and between home and work, a third, incipient sphering no less presaged industrial capitalism’s future: the split between capitalist production and philanthropic wealth.96 If Chickering lived out the Jacksonian ideal of equality of commercial opportunity, he was nonetheless a politically conservative Whig. He believed in the gospel of not only economic but also moral improvement, including in social reform. He withdrew profits from piano making, and instead of using them to augment his capital investments, they became charitable wealth. He placed this money in incorporated “voluntary associations” for the promotion of arts, education, and religion. Few such corporations existed in the South, and none on the slave plantations. ([Location 3808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3808))
- On the plantation, there was no threshold—no physical boundary—between home and work. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3825))
- The southern porch contrasts with the northern parlor. In the North, industrial economic production had left the site of the home, which then acquired new meanings.100 Popular New York architect Andrew Jackson Downing explained in Cottage Residences (1842) that the home must separate the family’s inner and outer worlds. Set apart from commercial self-interest, it was a place for “inward good”—for economically disinterested love. In the romantic idiom, it was the “place dearest to our hearts,” an “unfailing barrier” against the vices of the outside world.101 Downing’s architectural designs tucked the parlor deep into the home interior. There the “family circle” resided together in an intimate and affectionate space. ([Location 3826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3826))
- By contrast to the northern domestic parlor encased from the outside world, the porch in southern home architecture illustrated the still porous boundary between home and work on the plantation. The porch might also act as a venue for the surveillance of slaves. This house dates back to 1727. ([Location 3836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3836))
- The boundary between home life and the outside world was sacrosanct. The Beecher sisters renamed the parlor the “home room.”102 The home was “The Sphere of Woman,” according to the title of a representative 1844 middle-class magazine article. In the “home,” wives and mothers were tasked with “developing the heart’s best and holiest feeling.” The “dominion of woman” was the “affections.” Man’s sphere was outside the home ([Location 3841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3841))
- The gender ideology of “separate spheres” was yet another example of public and private sphering, giving rise to a new tension specific to an industrial society that was premised on borders from without rather than entanglements within. This was different from paternalism, which sought to draw oppositions by parsing the moral and economic morass of the plantation household. ([Location 3852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3852))
- Regardless of economic truths, the ideological shift was key. Women’s affective labor became all the more estimable as their labors, in pecuniary terms, were devalued. This made it possible for men’s industrial wage work to become a new symbol of masculine independence and of “freedom,” rather than dependence. ([Location 3857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3857))
- In the urban and industrial Northeast, especially among the better off, child labor was becoming less important. Children went to school, aided by the Whig Party’s public school movement and bequests from budding philanthropists ([Location 3868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3868))
- In sum, there were shifts in investment, in the broadest sense of that term—not only capital investments, but also emotional attachments and gender-defined aspirations. Critical changes were made in labor laws, new philanthropic associations were born, home architecture saw innovations, and a new emphasis was placed on childhood schooling. All this began to establish the many qualities of an industrial society. ([Location 3876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3876))
- Economically, in the shift to industry the by-now-more-dynamic North had greater potential for increasing returns to economic activity over time than did the slave South, an agricultural society, premised on the rank extraction of black labor, where ultimately diminishing returns loomed. Industrial investment can potentially multiply the production of wealth more so than any other factor. ([Location 3879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3879))
- Over the next century, however, nothing, not even the new industrial factories, would be more central to the industrial order than the breadwinner-homemaker family, which arose as yet another late–Age of Commerce solution to the same old problem: how might commerce be promoted, yet still be checked and kept within its proper bounds? During the 1840s and ’50s, the organization of family life made it clear that North and South gave two very different answers to this question. The growing distinction, which occurred in tandem with an economic divergence, contributed to the convulsion in politics. ([Location 3882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3882))
- after the recovery from the Panic of 1837, the invisible hand of the market began to fall down on the job of political union. The expansion of commerce began to sharpen rather than alleviate sectional differences.110 The task of maintaining the Union was dropped into the hands of politicians. There may be no greater example of the power of democratic politics to determine capitalism’s future than the sudden rise of the antislavery Republican Party after 1854.111 ([Location 3890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3890))
- What happened in 1854 was the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The congressional legislation was so inflammatory because, first, it undermined a number of political compromises that the states had already reached over the status of slavery in the western federal territories. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had admitted Missouri as a slave state, but had also barred slavery in the former Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30' parallel. Then after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the Mexican-American War (1846–48), had “ceded” California and present-day Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming to the United States, an aging Henry Clay engineered the Compromise of 1850, which admitted California as a free state; granted the South a stronger fugitive slave law; and established the principle of “popular sovereignty” to determine slavery’s future in the New Mexico and Utah territories. There residents would vote, and the majority would decide slavery’s existence. ([Location 3895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3895))
- Douglas meddled with this fragile state of affairs. Douglas wanted Congress to organize a new Nebraska territory, through which a transcontinental railroad would pass and from which Douglas stood to financially benefit. ([Location 3908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3908))
- Douglas’s 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act overturned the Missouri Compromise. The 36°30' parallel banning slavery to its north would no longer apply in lands acquired through the Louisiana Purchase. Instead, “popular sovereignty” would also determine slavery’s fate in the new territories of Kansas, which extended west into present-day Colorado, and Nebraska, which then extended north to Canada. In these territories, white male heads of household would vote on whether to have slavery. ([Location 3912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3912))
- Ever since the rise of the Democracy and the Whigs in the 1830s, the two parties had cobbled together national, cross-sectional constituencies. The vote on the Kansas-Nebraska Act positively split the Whigs, and the party effectively ceased to exist. Douglas’s Democratic Party, too, was in disarray. ([Location 3917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3917))
- For decades, the corn-and-hog complex of the Ohio River Valley was commercially connected to the slave plantations of the Old Southwest. In 1830 the Ohio-Mississippi river system took virtually the entirety of northwestern commercial traffic. In future decades, northwest commerce would shift from the southwest to the northeast. A contributing factor was the South’s post–Panics of 1837 and 1839 retreat to “safety first” subsistence strategies, in the context of the shift to paternalism.113 Northwestern foodstuffs were less in demand in the South. New interregional railroads linked the Northwest and the Northeast over the mountains. Altogether, by the 1850s, most northwestern goods were shipped by rail to the East rather than downriver to the South.

- Through the cotton trade, ties still bound the “lords of the lash” and the “lords of the loom,” as the antislavery Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner put it in an 1848 speech. New York City’s merchants and financiers had great economic interests in the South.115 But in the trans-Mississippi West, where the sectional struggle over slavery was to play out, commerce could no longer help.

- These shifting commercial patterns reflected a dynamic new Great Lakes thrust of colonization. A midwestern wheat belt had emerged north of the Old Northwest’s corn-and-hog belt. In 1848 the Illinois and Michigan Canal linked the Mississippi River to the young city of Chicago, and by 1860 Illinois enjoyed the honor of being the top wheat-producing state. Northwestern wheat farmers, like southern cotton producers, were exporters.

- The Great Lakes thrust of settlement brought “free soil” settlers into the Kansas and Nebraska territories. While oriented toward agricultural exports, the contrast with southern colonization was sharp. Slave capital was portable, which was one reason why it was valuable, but in the Midwest, slave colonization was less rapid than free soil colonization. Slaves were not cheap. Instead, Americans and European immigrants absolutely flooded the Midwest. In 1850 the foreign-born share of the population in the Wisconsin and Minnesota territories was 44 percent.117 The… ([Location 3946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=3946))

- In sum, the upper Northwest was developing a more diverse and dynamic economy, which began to resemble that of the Northeast.

- In the Northeast, meanwhile, industrial change was posing new political questions. The industrial Northeast was likely the fastest-growing and richest economic region on earth, but that is not the entire story.122 Northern urbanization was also rapid. Money incomes increased, but housing, water supply, and public sanitation suffered. Life expectancy actually declined, as did height and body mass indices.123 Further, the onset of urban industrialization had increased income inequality.124 Greater investment in industrial capital goods, in shaping labor demand, widened the gap between skilled and unskilled pay.

- It worked. The Republicans superseded the Know-Nothings swiftly, over the course of six months in 1855 and 1856. Timing and luck broke their way. European immigration had stalled in 1855, diminishing the Know-Nothings’ appeal. Recovery from the 1854 industrial downturn was quick, injecting some hope back into free labor. Then in “Bleeding Kansas,” free soil and slave colonizers had illegally grabbed Shawnee Indian lands, then turned against one another. In May 1856 a group led by the radical abolitionist John Brown murdered five pro-slavery men.134 Meanwhile a rigged pro-slavery territorial… ([Location 4009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4009))
- Lincoln was unusually tall, a gangly six foot four inches, with oversize ears, gray eyes, and a high-pitched squeaky voice. In the courtroom he had honed an engaging and folksy speaking style. People who knew him well commented on his ambition. He had not been a leading early architect of the Republican Party, but he was an eloquent spokesman for free labor, saying, “Free labor has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope.” He saw no fundamental conflict between “capital” and “labor,” as wage laborers could someday become property-owning producers.137 Greater access to “education,” he added, was key. ([Location 4019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4019))
- Lincoln had always said that slavery was morally wrong. The founders had not intended it to last. But politically Lincoln was more moderate. In states where slavery was legal, slaveholders had property rights protected by their state governments, whereas the federal Constitution was silent.138 In the western territories, the federal government had the authority to determine whether slavery should exist. There, he said, it must act, prohibiting slavery and thus bottling up the institution in the South where, eventually, it would perish. ([Location 4026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4026))
- Lincoln believed that while blacks had moral and political rights, the races should not mix socially or, worse, sexually reproduce. He followed Clay in supporting black colonization to Africa.139 ([Location 4030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4030))
- Lincoln’s attack on Senator Douglas was simple. The “Slave Power” was conspiring to open not only the West but the entire United States to slavery. Douglas was aiding and abetting it. First, the Kansas-Nebraska Act had revoked the Missouri Compromise. Then in a monument to white supremacy, Chief Justice Roger Taney and the southern-controlled Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), had erased the possibility of black citizenship rights and barred the federal government from regulating slavery in any federal territory that had been acquired after the signing of the Constitution. ([Location 4032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4032))
- After Dred Scott, slave asset prices climbed in expectation of future profits from the spread of slavery.140 Lincoln predicted the Supreme Court would declare slavery to be legal everywhere, including the North. Slavery would become national. ([Location 4037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4037))
- “A house,” Lincoln declared when he had announced for the Senate, “divided against itself cannot stand.” The United States could not “endure, permanently half slave and half free.” ([Location 4039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4039))
- Douglas won reelection to the Senate in 1858, sweeping downstate corn-and-hog Illinois. Tellingly, however, Lincoln carried the northern counties, the city of Chicago, and the Illinois wheat belt. Nevertheless, the Lincoln-Douglas debates made Lincoln a national political figure and while he was a dark horse candidate, in 1860 he would go on to win the Republican Party’s nomination for president. He learned of his nomination while sitting in his parlor in his home in Springfield. The house, fenced off from the public street, did not have a street-facing front porch. Lincoln had removed it in an 1855 home renovation. ([Location 4047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4047))
- The electoral map for the presidential election of 1860 looked like this: Despite the “lords of the loom,” antislavery New England was Republican. Despite New York City, a Democratic Party stronghold, Republicans could still carry New York State. The Republicans bought off Pennsylvania with Whig-like tariff protection, especially for its ironmongers. The internal improvement hungry Great Lakes wheat belt was solid Republican. For Lincoln to win the White House, the Republican Party had to win enough votes in downstate Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. ([Location 4051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4051))
- Lincoln knew slavery, had seen it with his own eyes, and despised it morally. By the 1850s, on a later estimate, the cost of hiring a wage laborer for the four-month corn harvest was roughly equivalent to the annualized cost of an adult male black slave.144 Should the economic incentives tip, the racial views of downstate corn farmers would not exactly prohibit them from purchasing black slaves, should government allow it. After Dred Scott, Lincoln commonly made dire predictions about the spread of slavery into the North. Much if not most of it was calculated political rhetoric. One suspects, however, that Lincoln genuinely did fear the possible reintroduction of black slavery in such places as downstate Illinois. Did corn farmers north of the Ohio River want slaveholders using their slaves as collateral to buy up the best lands? Could they compete with slave labor on the other side of the river—or in Kansas and Nebraska? Lincoln spooked them. ([Location 4061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4061))
- Between 1858 and 1860, Republican votes in a number of downstate Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio counties increased by just enough. He would carry Illinois and Indiana by a shade over 50 percent, Ohio by 52 percent. While he won only 40 percent of the national popular vote, it was enough in the Electoral College to put him in the White House. ([Location 4068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4068))
- President Lincoln was determined to end slavery’s geopolitical extension across space, that dominant theme of the Age of Commerce which, as we have seen, lay at the heart of the political-economic settlement of the Empire of Liberty. Moreover his proclamation that the United States could not forever exist half slave and half free meant that the Empire of Liberty was no more. Republican secretary of state William Seward glimpsed instead “the expansion of the empire of free white men”—an empire of free soil and free labor. ([Location 4071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4071))
- Slave capital was valuable precisely because it was portable. The South still had plenty of land available for cultivation, but rationally or not, southerners now hitched their economic expectations to the continued geographic spread of slavery. As a Georgia congressman put it bluntly on the House floor in 1856, “There is not a slaveholder in the House or out of it, but who knows perfectly well that, whenever slavery is confined within certain specified limits its existence is doomed.”147 Lincoln agreed. No wonder that after his election, southern capital markets priced a different future expectation, and slave asset prices declined by a third. ([Location 4076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4076))
- In 1860 the value of black slaves exceeded the total value of the U.S. industrial capital stock. The political destruction of enslaved capital alone was bound to initiate a new age of American capitalism. That the most intensive period of industrial revolution in all of U.S. history occurred in the decades after the Civil War was no coincidence. The Age of Capital saw the emergence of an industrial capitalism. ([Location 4092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4092))
- The industrial revolution was exactly that—a revolution. In economic history, only the permanent shift of hunting and gathering populations into settled agriculture, the Neolithic Revolution of some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, is of comparable significance.

- To many historians writing during the industrial epoch, which lasted from the 1870s through the 1970s, a modern industrial economy appeared to be a natural state of affairs. Their question was, what obstacles had for so long stood in the way, preventing industrialization from happening before? But industrialization was not inevitable, nor did it play out everywhere in the same way. The strangeness of the industrial revolution must be appreciated.

- The Jeffersonian Empire of Liberty was no more. Slavery was abolished. The federal government asserted a more robust and uniform sovereignty, devolving relatively less rule than it had before to households, corporations, the individual states, and Indian sovereigns. Instead, government offered inducements for private industrial development. It granted subsidies to railroad corporations—no longer subsovereigns of the Empire of Liberty, and more fully private, for-profit actors that, soon enough, had constitutionally protected rights as property owners. ([Location 4102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4102))
- Federal legislation created a single uniform national currency and a national banking system that funneled money and credit from around the country into New York City’s burgeoning capital and credit markets. Money capital and credit now concentrated on Wall Street. By contrast, in the South, former slaves fell prey to a sharecropping regime in which credit, for them, was scarce.

- First, the industrial revolution transformed production.

Capital goods generated gain by being used up, depreciating over time, and losing value, through labor and enterprise.

- whenever confidence collapsed, when a competitive panic broke out among the owners of capital, the cycle would reverse. Values and prices plummeted in the midst of the short-term hoarding of money and other liquid, money-like assets, offering a precautionary retreat from the hazards of investment. The multiplying effects of industrial investment diminished, and the result was not long-term growth. Industrial development decelerated. The economy slumped. In this way, the contradictory drive of speculative investment—the conflicts among speculation, investment, and hoarding—resulted in periodic booms and busts.

- In this era, the Age of Commerce’s political economy of property ownership gave way to a new political economy of income. Property ownership, of land and slaves, had been the anchor of U.S. political economy before the Civil War. Afterward a politics slowly emerged that politicized not so much the distribution of capital ownership as the division of the higher money incomes yielded from private investment of capital, in the midst of industrialization. ([Location 4150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4150))
- corporations, as philanthropic wealth—not as capital. The outlines of the new political economy of income were on the scene by the 1890s, but they were hardly settled, especially in the western and southern countryside, where issues of property ownership, debt, and deflation continued to predominate. The Panic of 1893 and yet another cyclical downturn led to an agrarian political insurgency. ([Location 4156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4156))
- Populists attacked the gold standard—to which the United States had returned following the Civil War—for restricting the money and credit supply and for contributing to a grinding era of commodity price deflation. They attacked large, democratically unaccountable, and monopolistic railroad and banking corporations. Raising the Jacksonian banner of antimonopoly and equal commercial opportunity, Populists arrayed the interests of “the people” against those of industrial and financial elites. ([Location 4160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4160))
- But the cycles of boom and bust, exacerbated by policy makers’ attachment to the gold standard, meant that the Age of Capital ended with the greatest bust in all history. Values plummeted, and factories, poised for mass production, idled. The Great Depression left millions of male breadwinners out of work, on the streets, and capital mired deep in a liquidity trap of precautionary hoarding from which the owners of capital could not escape. After generations of extraordinary economic vitality, their nerves were shot. ([Location 4177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4177))
- Economically speaking, emancipation destroyed $3 billion worth of enslaved property.5 White masters could no longer coerce black slaves to labor; they could not collateralize them in credit markets; they could not sell black lives in appreciating capital markets. The “complete destruction” of slave property without any compensation was, as the historians Charles Beard and Mary Beard argued almost a century ago, surely “the most stupendous act of sequestration in the history of Anglo-Saxon Jurisprudence.”6 It made the Civil War into the greatest turning point in the history of American capitalism, full stop.

- Most dramatically, to win the war, it floated a massive public debt in international capital markets.

- On May 20, 1862, Lincoln signed the Homestead Act into law, which offered loyal citizens and immigrants 160 acres of federal land from the public domain.

- In 1861 President Lincoln appointed Thomas A. Scott, the brilliant superintendent and vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, to serve as assistant secretary of war.24 Scott worked under Secretary of War Simon Cameron, a friend of Scott’s and the most corrupt government official in the Union. Scott did not even resign his post at the Penn Railroad when he went to Washington. He could set the terms, because the Union was in dire need of his expertise.

- Already by 1862, U.S. bonds deposited in New York City became the basis of a standardized system of payments among banks. Everywhere, smaller “country” banks made deposits in larger banks, successively “pyramiding” their reserves up to the largest banks in New York. Drafts on reserves held in New York became the means of payment across the North. Greater transactional liquidity assisted the integration of markets and the flows of commerce. Discounts on notes declined and converged. ([Location 4311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4311))

Because of the South’s large subsistence sector, it had little transportation infrastructure for foodstuffs. ([Location 4372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4372))
- to build an internal rail network, but to little effect.42 The southern planter class refused to switch from cotton cultivation to war production. Meanwhile southern planters had informally embargoed foreign cotton sales, hoping Britain would recognize the CSA, but that gambit failed when British cotton manufacturers tapped Indian imports.

- The Confederate Army went hungry, while planters’ bales of cotton rotted on docks due to the Union naval blockade. Then, as the tax-in-kind fell on yeoman households, massive tax resistance erupted. In 1863 mobs of women in Richmond promised “bread or blood.” ([Location 4379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4379))
- Southern states had seceded from the United States because they feared central state power. But of necessity, central government power over the economy increased during the war. The irony was lost on no one. ([Location 4388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4388))

- Upon the Union victory, $1.00 in gold, at the prewar parity exchange rate, traded at $1.50 in paper currency. The policy of returning to par was called resumption. Since resumption would demand fiscal retrenchment and credit contraction, and the government’s resources were limited, political will would be necessary to achieve a meaningful political and economic reconstruction of the South. In the economic reconstruction of the South, much would be up for grabs, and nothing would be more critical than control over land and labor. ([Location 4407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4407))
- Johnson’s plan for Reconstruction had been to pardon most Confederates and readmit the former Confederate states to the Union after they ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. ([Location 4413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4413))
- Only a week after final ratification, however, on December 18, the leader of the Radical Republicans in the House, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, rose to the floor. Abolition was not enough. Stevens demanded full civil and political rights for blacks, including enfranchisement. To ensure those rights, Stevens called for the confiscation of the plantations of former Confederate rebels and their subdivision into black homesteads. ([Location 4415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4415))
- In the South, control over the land was crucial, inseparable from control over future black labor.52 Land was the only capital asset the South had left—slavery was destroyed, and the region’s monetary and financial system was in utter shambles. ([Location 4419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4419))
- the wage labor contracts violated the Yankee free labor doctrine of “employment at will.” Blacks could not quit employment in jobs governed by such contracts. Southern lawmakers passed the Black Codes, which promulgated outrageous unfreedoms. In the fall 1865 harvest, many planters failed to pay wages and instead offered workers slave rations.58 Stevens’s argument that abolition alone was not enough was looking convincing. ([Location 4429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4429))
- To contract the currency would be to limit the supply of money and credit and potentially deflate values and prices. ([Location 4439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4439))
- But after the war, the money question came roaring back onto the national political stage.60 It would split the Republican Party, throw the wrench of austerity into political Reconstruction, and both directly and indirectly undermine the black struggle for economic freedom. ([Location 4443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4443))
- McCulloch became the first comptroller of the currency, the office in charge of issuing the new national banknotes. He became Treasury secretary in 1865, determined to retire the greenbacks from circulation and to put the dollar back on a metallic standard. ([Location 4448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4448))
- “Well-secured convertible paper currency” meant a metallic currency, whose quantity was not left to democratic politics to determine. It therefore secured the scarcity value of money capital while stabilizing the general price level. The discretionary expansion of bank money in excess of the hard-currency standard would remain the privilege of banking corporations, with the New York banks at the apex of the reserve and loan pyramids. All this required that the federal government retire greenbacks and deflate the value of the dollar, ultimately to repeg the currency to its prewar fixed exchange ratio to gold and silver. This was the policy of resumption. ([Location 4455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4455))
- Great Britain was on the gold standard. During the 1860s, the British industrial revolution had dramatically accelerated.63 Higher money incomes, inequitably distributed, meant Britain had excess surplus capital, in the form of savings, to export.64 The American northeastern banking and financial community hoped to seduce that capital and control where it went. To do so, the United States would have to credibly commit to resumption and to maintaining the scarcity value of capital on a consistent basis thereafter, so that foreign investments would never devalue on U.S. soil. ([Location 4462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4462))
- the resumptionists had an entire political-economic program beyond gold. ([Location 4473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4473))
- To commit to an invariable metallic standard, the United States would have to devalue its currency and fiscally retrench. It must close budget deficits, signaling to investors that it would never help finance them by inflating away the value of the public debts, owned by the government’s creditors.68 Austerity would mean that wartime taxes could be rolled back, if not eliminated, also placating private investors fearful of taxation. The high tariff, while necessary to fund gold payments on the debt, could also be radically reduced. Federal revenue should be devoted to retiring greenbacks, bringing the “gold premium” closer to prewar parity, and extinguishing the U.S. public debt. ([Location 4477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4477))
- Finally, the role of the South in all this would be to restore cotton production as quickly as possible, for cotton was the only real source of U.S. exports—and thus the hard, foreign exchange earnings necessary to support resumption of a specie standard. ([Location 4482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4482))
- Men such as McCulloch did not like early reports that freedpeople, now possessing lands of their own, were employing safety-first strategies, as opposed to putting all acreage in cotton production.69 In sum, the requirements of resumption must take precedence over southern Reconstruction. The argument that paying reparations to former slaves was not possible because government could not afford it has echoed over ages. ([Location 4484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4484))
- The large majority of Republicans from the bank- and finance-rich districts of the Northeast supported the measure. But a bloc of Radical Republicans, largely from the Midwest, led by Congressman Stevens, broke ranks. Resumption had split the Radicals. ([Location 4491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4491))
- An expansion of currency and credit was necessary to sufficiently capitalize genuine black economic freedom. ([Location 4502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4502))
- Further, to the Stevens wing, greenbacks—unbacked by gold or silver—would make the domestic U.S. capital market freer from foreign dependency. Returning to gold would link the American and British money and capital markets. In 1866 a banking panic crashed London financial markets, and the Bank of England raised its interest rate in the short-term money market, which drained gold from the United States into Britain, in search of the higher yield. But because the greenback was not pegged to gold, the U.S. money market remained unstirred. ([Location 4503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4503))

- With resumption, the so-called McCulloch Contraction ensued. From 1865 through 1867, the U.S. money supply contracted and prices deflated. The “gold premium” narrowed.76 Due to poor harvests in Europe, the prices of U.S. agricultural commodities were relatively stable, but industrial capital and industrial labor suffered the most, as prices fell.

Radical Republicans, promising to make good on the Civil War, swept the Congress, taking the reins of Reconstruction during the onset of the deflationary slump.

- The protective industrial tariff survived the war. Rates actually increased. In 1870 the duty on finished steel rails was raised to twenty-eight dollars per ton, equivalent to the entire British selling price.81 The tariff and continued fiscal retrenchment meant that wartime taxes could be reduced.

- In 1868 the Republican nominee, General Ulysses Grant, won the presidential election. Grant was a resumptionist, and after his victory, with one-third of Democrats and three-quarters of Republicans in favor, Congress passed the Public Credit Act of 1869, which Grant signed. It pledged the federal government to pay back all U.S. public debt in gold, and promised to the world the eventual resumption of a metallic standard for the dollar at prewar parity.86 Politically, resumption was settled. ([Location 4552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4552))
- After 1866 the national McCulloch Contraction coincided with a devastating credit crunch in the South that was of decisive influence in the ongoing southern struggle over land and labor. The result was the rise of black sharecropping. ([Location 4556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4556))
- Before the war, enslaved capital had been the asset basis of the southern credit system. To capitalize a new asset class overnight, land being the obvious candidate, was not so easy.87 In 1865 few southern banks were left standing in the war-ravaged South. Few national banknotes or greenbacks circulated. Of the 1,688 national banks incorporated between 1865 and 1868, only 20 were incorporated in the five leading cotton-growing states.88 What emerged, quickly, was the crop lien—credit extended to planters on the promise of delivering future cotton. ([Location 4558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4558))
- Cotton cultivation still required labor, of course, so armed with the Black Codes, planters sought to reinstitute something like large-scale gang labor, now called “squads.” But black resistance was massive. ([Location 4564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4564))
- In particular, black women, whether in the planters’ fields, or in white homes—as cooks, washers, ironers, seamstresses, chambermaids—withdrew their labor. The old plantation household was dead, as black families demanded and won greater autonomy over their labor. ([Location 4566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4566))
- Meanwhile the withdrawal of black labor, in combination with bad weather, led to abysmal cotton harvests in 1865 and 1866.92 It all contributed to planters’ ongoing credit troubles. ([Location 4568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4568))
- By 1868 a regime of tenant sharecropping had rounded into shape—for freedpeople, it was better than slavery but hardly the best possible outcome.93 With scarce cash on hand, planters began to commute black wages into crop shares. Planters divided estates into tenant plots—thirty to fifty acres—for individual black families to cultivate one year at a time. The landowner provided the tenant with seed, housing, fuel, stock, feed, and farm implements. The sharecropper, the black head of household, organized the labor. Planters had far less control over labor than they had under slavery. ([Location 4571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4571))
- Sharecropping contracts listed the amount of land to be tilled for each crop, and soon enough the landowner-tenant split of the crop settled at 50-50. ([Location 4575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4575))

- McCulloch Contraction did not help. Between 1865 and 1868, in the context of a national price deflation and credit contraction, the crop lien locked the southern agricultural economy into an unjust and economically inefficient credit regime. ([Location 4585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4585))
- The slave economy of the past had an economic rationality that the era of Jim Crow racism would lack.98 Arguably, it was a more efficient capitalist economy, one that increased capital investment and labor productivity over time.99 Sharecropping did not do that. It incentivized the immediate expansion of cotton production, to pay off debts, but not greater long-term capital investment. ([Location 4587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4587))
- At the basis of sharecropping was the local, political exploitation of black families through debt. Without land, the freedpeople turned to democratic politics.101 The Fifteenth Amendment, enshrining black suffrage rights, was ratified in 1870. In the face of white violence and property rights in the land, however, the ballot was not enough to stop the sharecropping regime from solidifying. Southern white elites did not appear to mind the lack of economic dynamism so much. Having lost political power at the federal level, white supremacy dug in at the local scale. The planter class successfully maintained its rule—racism transformed, now hampering economic development. ([Location 4592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4592))
- Southern economic institutional failure would persist until the political intervention of the New Deal during the 1930s.104 To their economic detriment, most southern blacks would remain tied to the rural plantation economy during the era of U.S. industrialization, which, unlike industrialization in any other country, would draw its pool of industrial laborers from abroad.

- In 1868 Jay Gould was thirty-two years old. Starting from humble origins in New York’s Catskill Mountains, by the time the Civil War broke out, he was living in New York City. On credit, he acquired a stake in a small railroad corporation. He was by all accounts a shy, wispy, and reserved man, but he soon enough became the greatest financial operator in U.S. history.

- Between 1868 and 1873, railroad corporations constructed 24,589 miles of new rail, more than half in the trans-Mississippi West and the Far West.116 In Smithian fashion, the railroads increased the extent of markets and the demand for goods across an expanding continental marketplace. ([Location 4666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4666))
- However, the great railroad entrepreneurs always remained undecided, if not conflicted, about where to deploy their time, energy, and capital—whether in short-term speculation or in long-term durable investment. Why go through the time, hassle, and uncertainty of actually building a railroad and running it on a profitable basis when credit was readily available (for these men at least)? If the right rumor gripped the trading floor, they could turn a fast buck through leveraged speculation on a financial asset, without ever having to part with liquidity, and put capital on the ground where it became a fixed, running cost.

- Long-term, high-grade railroad bond rates settled in the low 6 percent region after the war.118 That was the hurdle for profit making from enterprise. Why do that, and of necessity divert resources to pay workers, when one could make profits from short-term financial speculations without paying anyone? Economic inequality increased in this era much because many of the owners of reconstructed capital sometimes could not find good answers to these questions. They manipulated finance to enrich themselves. ([Location 4674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4674))
- The brothers put their fingers on the main point. The issue was not private greed—unchecked commercial self-interest, after all, had been a moral problem time out of mind.

- The Adams brothers wrote of Vanderbilt: [He] has combined the natural power of the individual with the factitious power of the corporation.

- 1867 Congress formed a peace commission to negotiate treaties with Plains Indians. More than a decade before, in 1851, the Treaty of Fort Laramie had acknowledged the sovereign possessions of the Great Plains tribes, while granting the United States the right to establish roads and build military forts. At an 1867 council in Medicine Lodge Creek, in Kansas, some members of Southern Plains peoples—Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, and southern Cheyenne and Arapaho—ceded tribal lands to the federal government.

- After the Civil War, the sovereignty of the U.S. nation-state, within its expanding jurisdiction, was more uniform and robust. Yet the policy of resumption, and the desire to go back to a metallic standard, diminished national sovereignty, for resumption opened the U.S. financial system to the vicissitudes of international money capital. An Atlantic financial panic in 1873—the result of the interactions between a credit crunch in Europe and the vulnerable postwar Wall Street financial system—put an end to the post-1868 U.S. railroad boom. The economic slump that followed contributed to the end of political Reconstruction in the South. ([Location 4792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4792))
- The policy of resumption had harnessed the U.S. economy to the international gold standard and thus to the fortunes of international economic events. In 1873 gold began to drain from the United States to Britain. After the crash of the stock exchange in Vienna, shaky credit conditions in Europe led to a competitive panic among the owners of capital to hold safe, liquid assets.142 As everyone sought to get their hands on gold, the Bank of England saw the British banking system’s gold reserves dwindle. In response, it raised its short-term bank interest rate from 4 to 9 percent. Seeking the higher yield and fearful of a general panic, gold deposits swung into British banks from everywhere, including from the United States. Credit began to contract on Wall Street.

- An additional problem was that, to fund their operations, U.S. railroad corporations had grown dependent on the short-term call money market to help roll over their prodigious debts. U.S. railroad corporate debt had climbed from $416 million in 1867 to $2.2 billon in 1870.144 By 1873, interest rate yields on fresh railroad bonds remained at 6 percent.

Loans in the call money market hit 360 percent.148 Depositors rushed to remove their deposits from New York banks, for fear that, caught out, they might fail as well. Creditors called in their loans. European investors, who had no less than £82.7 million invested in U.S. railroad securities in January 1873, repatriated their capital.149 Confidence collapsed. Precautionary hoarding broke out. The collapse of credit and prices depressed spending and commercial activity. Railroad stocks lost 60 percent of their value. Half of all U.S. railroad corporations tumbled into bankruptcy.

- Sensing an opportunity, Jay Gould swept in and took control of the tottering Union Pacific.150 Not only had resumption channeled credit to Wall Street, at the expense of other regions (and people); the restoration of the scarcity value of money capital had led to a surge in expectations among the owners of capital, and thus to speculative lending, but at the high interest rates necessary to achieve resumption. Easy money, at high rates, often results in a particularly bad slump when the credit cycle reverses. ([Location 4829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4829))
- the economic slump that followed the Panic of 1873 exhibited new characteristics specific to the burgeoning era of industrial capitalism. Industrial capital is fixed, sunk on the ground, and hence illiquid. Even as potential spenders hoard money, and demand for goods collapses, industrial capitalists may keep the machines running to recoup something of their prior investments. Goods still flood the market, and prices fall further.151 The economic slump that followed the Panic of 1873 was not a slump in economic output.152 Rather, it took the form of a grinding price deflation across the Atlantic. The “great depression” of prices, it was called. ([Location 4834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4834))
- In the late nineteenth century, the term great depression referred to the era’s grinding price deflation—initiated in the United States by the policy of resumption. ([Location 4841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4841))
- Republicans did little to help. The mantra “free soil, free labor, free men” provided little guidance for various emerging industrial predicaments: price deflation, poverty and inequality amid greater wealth generation, labor strikes. ([Location 4843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4843))
- More deflation was the solution to deflation, and more bankruptcy was the solution to bankruptcy—cries that would echo throughout the Age of Capital, through the Great Depression of the 1930s. ([Location 4850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4850))
- The lame-duck Radical Republican Congress passed the Civil Rights Bill of 1875, which the U.S. Supreme Court would later annul in the Civil Rights Cases (1883). More troops were now stationed in the West to coerce Indians onto reservations than in the South to enforce black civil and political rights.

- Tilden won the popular vote, but the balance in the Electoral College hinged on disputed returns in southern states. There was fear of a return to sectional violence.156 Who stepped in to attempt to broker a compromise? Tom Scott.157 The essence of the Scott plan was southern acceptance of Republican victory, in return for the full white “redemption” of the South, and federal subsidies for Scott’s bankrupt southern transcontinental, the Texas & Pacific. ([Location 4864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4864))
- More than future economic prosperity of any kind, let alone a northeastern- and European-owned railroad, southern congressional politicians were now invested, above all, in the restoration of local rule in pursuit of the maintenance of white supremacy.159 Republicans acquiesced. In the Compromise of 1877, Hayes became president. U.S. troops left South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, and the military occupation of the South was formally over. Reconstruction was finished. ([Location 4871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4871))
- a lot had changed since the last time the dollar was pegged to gold and silver. Enslaved capital had been destroyed. Four million emancipated black Americans enjoyed a newfound freedom, but, as southern sharecropping continued the white exploitation of black labor, the monetary and financial system that arose during the war and its aftermath benefited Wall Street and the owners of private joint-stock corporations increasingly emancipated from public duties. ([Location 4877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4877))
- Meanwhile one response to the national trauma of the Civil War was a cynicism in political economy, in which the patriotism dropped out but the profit seeking remained. The neomercantilist, neo-Hamiltonian, and Jacksonian inheritances all acquired bad names. ([Location 4883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4883))
- Teenage Carnegie did not attend school. In 1853 Tom Scott hired him as a telegraph operator, and by age twenty, Carnegie had become Scott’s personal assistant. ([Location 4895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4895))
- Scott taught Carnegie everything he knew. The Penn Railroad deployed prodigious amounts of productive fixed capital, in rails, cars, and locomotives. Due to the running costs of using up that capital, the railroad had to run its cars as fast and as full as possible. To do so, the corporation became the first great modern managerial enterprise, probably the most efficient business bureaucracy in the world at that time. ([Location 4896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4896))
- Scott schooled Carnegie in the logic of industrial capital. Operating cost determined selling price. Profit in the face of fixed and running costs demanded high operating volume and velocity so as to achieve dynamic economies of scale. ([Location 4900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4900))
- Scott, an entrepreneurial two-face, also taught Carnegie the art of short-term speculation in liquid capital markets, as well as the art of corporate self-dealing. ([Location 4902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4902))
- Carnegie, at thirty-three, was weighed down by a guilty conscience. “Man must have an idol,” he wrote to himself. But “the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money.”8 Conflicted, he ceased his financial speculations. ([Location 4918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4918))
- Why go through the effort and expense of fixing capital on the ground—erecting a steelworks, organizing production, hiring workers, manufacturing a product, and seeking a final market for steel, in hopes that the final sale price would ultimately exceed the cost of production—when one could, as Carnegie had, speculatively wheel-and-deal from a luxurious suite at the Windsor Hotel on New York’s Fifth Avenue? Tom Scott had always played both games. Why abandon confidence games completely and drive only for industrial production? ([Location 4928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4928))
- Carnegie stumbled upon a common issue in the Age of Capital. For centuries, in commerce, the goal had been to buy low and sell high, given competitive market prices. Early manufacturers knew the cost of their raw materials, or of labor, because market prices for them were available. But the larger the industrial enterprise, and the greater the fixed investment, the more difficult it became to tabulate the costs of manufacturing—using up capital by running a furnace, or moving around materials—because there were no markets, internal to a firm, to price these activities. The Pennsylvania Railroad, among other railroads, had led the way in developing new methods to account for such operating costs that could not be priced by markets. What was called the “operating ratio” among railroad accountants measured revenues in excess of production costs—per unit of output, over time. ([Location 4952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4952))
- Carnegie applied product cost accounting to steelmaking. He once told his men: Show me your cost sheets. It is more interesting to know how cheaply and how well you have done this thing than how much money you have made, because the one is a temporary result, due possibly to special conditions of trade, but the other means a permanency that will go on with the works as long as they last.15 “Carnegie never wanted to know the profits,” his own protégé, Charles M. Schwab, recalled. “He always wanted to know the cost.” ([Location 4959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4959))
- Carnegie also engaged in what economists call “capital deepening.” More than increasing the division of labor, he put more productive capital in the hands of the same worker. That increased labor productivity over time. Whenever capital equipment became available, capable of producing more product at less unit cost, he invested in it—sometimes scrapping perfectly good existing structures and equipment. ([Location 4971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4971))
- Bill Jones, a former machinist and Union Civil War captain, ran operations on the shop floor and became renowned for his expertise in production. Symbolically, Carnegie paid him the same salary as the president of the United States. ([Location 4976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4976))
- Jones also developed a method of pouring steel directly into ingot molds that sat on moving flatcars, a premonition of mechanized assembly-line production, which would be, in Henry Ford’s automobile factories, the productive culmination of the Age of Capital. ([Location 4980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4980))
- Meanwhile Carnegie increased the scale of his operations. “Cheapness is in proportion to the scale of production,” he said. “To make ten tons of steel a day would cost many time[s] as much per ton as to make one hundred tons. Thus the larger the scale of operation the cheaper the product.”18 Larger scale demanded greater bureaucratic coordination from start to finish and the “vertical integration” of production. Carnegie himself could help sell the final product in final markets. ([Location 4982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4982))
- Pecuniary profits were continuously plowed back into the enterprise as reinvestments into fresh productive capital, and soon Carnegie was independent from bankers and external financiers, as well as from grumbling partners. Carnegie was still determined to make a fortune. But perhaps even more, he was now driven, obsessively so, to manufacture more steel at less cost. ([Location 4988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4988))
- The results were fantastical. In 1875 the Edgar Thomson works produced 21,674 tons of steel. In 1889 the same facility produced 536,838 tons. The production cost of steel rails plummeted from $58 to $25 per ton. ([Location 4991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4991))
- Dramatic improvements in quality were attained as well. The average life of a rail increased from two to ten years. The bearing weight of a railcar leaped from 8 to 70 tons. ([Location 4993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4993))
- Indeed, the profits took care of themselves. In its first month of operations, the Thomson works turned a profit of $11,000—a figure Carnegie believed was unprecedented in the history of U.S. manufacturing. In 1888 the annual profits of the Carnegie Steel Company were $2 million. In 1890, they reached $5.4 million.20 In manufacturing nothing like this had ever happened in the history of the world. ([Location 4994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=4994))
- Carnegie had created in his steelworks a new regimen of industrial time. The economic dynamic of the Age of Commerce had most involved space, as the extent of markets increased through the imperial conquest of territory. The post–Civil War spread of the railroads furthered the dynamic.22 But to it, Carnegie added a new one. The result was a greater intensity of production in place, given standard units of time—more stuff, at less cost, per hour. ([Location 5005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5005))
- The time signature of money capital was cyclical. The capitalist credit cycle—the eventfulness of boom and bust, the drama of speculative mania and precautionary panic—repeated. By contrast, the time signature of capital in the arena of industrial production was abstract, linear, and standardized. ([Location 5012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5012))
- To coordinate rail traffic, railroad corporations first divided the North American continent into four “standard” time zones. Standard time went into effect on November 18, 1883. When it was noon in Philadelphia, it was noon in Pittsburgh.24 Standard, abstract time coordinated national railroad traffic and would govern the life of productive capital when invested in industry. ([Location 5017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5017))
- A final issue to consider is the functioning of a new industrial investment multiplier, which now complemented the Smithian commercial multiplier, in the achievement of increasing returns to economic activity. A farmer might harvest wheat and, selling it in a competitive market, earn a higher money income, but that would be the end of it. By contrast, Carnegie manufactured steel. Steel, an “intermediate,” or “capital good,” multiplied a whole series of backward and forward linkages, fostering downstream demand for coal and coke, as well as for the components of his factories, while supplying, upstream, goods for railroad corporations or the construction industry.25 Due to Carnegie’s achievements, firms began to expect these activities to be profitable in the future, and so they were called forth in the present. Production in general expanded. Carnegie’s singular drive to manufacture steel thus helped catalyze a larger, cumulative process of industrialization.

- The English historian Arnold Toynbee popularized the term industrial revolution in 1883, when U.S. industrialization had entered its most intensive phase.26 Five years later the U.S. economist John Bates Clark popularized the term capital good to refer to a distinct kind of productive asset.27 A capital good was a “factor of production,” an already-produced, or “… ([Location 5035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5035))
- The best possible definition of industrial revolution in general is the process by which the pattern of investment definitively shifts into intermediate capital goods, breeding new economic habits.

- The economic rupture cannot be emphasized enough. By the numbers, the industrial revolution gave rise to what economists call “modern economic growth”—self-sustaining increases in per capita income growth over time. Smithian growth had initiated the phenomenon. Nonetheless, industrialization represented a quantitative break from the past. The rupture was qualitative as well: the industrial revolution was civilizational in scope. Industrial societies became the world’s first urban societies. Culture, even aesthetic experience, changed, as color would now be dominated for a generation by the soot and cinder of industrial grays and… ([Location 5047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5047))
- Fossil fuels were at the center of the productive feats of the industrial revolution.32 The most remarkable quality of the new capital goods was their greater energy intensity. Many of the backward and forward linkages of industrialization were possible only given the use of new energy stocks. Further, energy stocks, as factors of production that deplete over time, themselves expressed the logic of “capital goods.” ([Location 5057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5057))
- Prior to widespread coal use, commercial economies remained rural economies, simply because energy flows were impossible to store or transport. Production necessarily dispersed to where there was waterpower. One reason economic development in the Age of Commerce was spatial was that populations, in order to tap into energy flows, had to move rather than concentrate. With industrialization, however, “specialization growth” across space was supplemented by “power growth” in place.35 Concentrated stocks of energy could be brought to concentrated sites of production. ([Location 5065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5065))
- Tellingly, in an organic economy, the only portable energy stock was enslaved people.36 ([Location 5070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5070))
- The steam engine liberated industrial activity from proximity to waterpower. It could cluster in cities, “industrial districts,” as the late nineteenth-century English economist Alfred Marshall branded them, where capital, labor, commerce, and technical innovation agglomerated and networked, feeding off one another, increasing supply and demand, backward and forward. ([Location 5076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5076))
- In this way industrial capitalism opened up a new terrain of pecuniary profit making, as it blew past the productive limits of an organic economy. Long-term, exponential “modern economic growth” became possible. ([Location 5086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5086))
- Both the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Carnegie Steel Company were offshoots of the midcentury industrial transformation of eastern Pennsylvania, where the emergent properties of a new energy- and capital-intensive industrial economy first took ([Location 5090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5090))
- Three-quarters of the earth’s anthracite deposits once resided in a five-hundred-square-mile region that runs from the aptly named town of Carbondale, in northeastern Pennsylvania, southwest through the Lehigh River Valley to Pottsville, on the Schuylkill River. It became the first American coal mining region. ([Location 5094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5094))
- Dead plants and animals decay in oxygen-poor environments, and after thousands of years a spongy biomass forms, called peat. Gravity, and heat from the earth’s core, removes water and gases from peat, leaving behind high concentrations of carbon. After millions of years, peat bogs become coal. The more water and gases are removed from the peat, the higher the carbon concentration. Peat becomes lignite, then subbituminous, then bituminous coal. Pressure from the movement of tectonic plates produces anthracite coal, which is almost pure carbon. It burns longer, hotter, and cleaner than any other coal. ([Location 5099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5099))
- Because of their proximity to coal, Pennsylvania manufacturers first turned to coal. Philadelphia’s cast-iron stove industry prospered as early as the 1830s, taking advantage of anthracite in metallurgy. By the outbreak of the Civil War, Pennsylvania produced a half-million tons of steel, consuming 1.5 million tons of coal per year. By then, the Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest industrial corporation in the world and a great consumer of coal. ([Location 5108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5108))
- Thus the mid-Atlantic region industrialized differently from New England. It specialized in the production of intermediate capital goods, like metals and machines, rather than consumer goods such as textiles. In New England, waterpower drove the textile mills, so they flourished in small, rural villages.44 But in the mid-Atlantic, the backward and forward linkages of coal, steam, iron, and steel first appeared in urban settings. By 1870 there were seven hundred steam engines in the anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania.45 Cheap coal made the stationary steam engine economical in manufacturing. Greater urban agglomerations of manufacturing became possible, which created network effects. Urban population growth strongly correlated with the adoption of the steam engine in manufacturing.46 In the city factories, the coal-fired steam engine ran continuously, at command. Unlike waterwheel or windmill power, steam power was impervious to the natural rhythms of climate and weather. Carnegie ran his steelworks twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. ([Location 5119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5119))
- Urban demand for artificial light (as well as for machine lubricants) initiated the discovery and extraction of another fossil fuel, oil. The first U.S. oil rush occurred in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in the late 1850s. Steam engines powered the oil drills. ([Location 5132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5132))
- In manufacturing, the steam engine was the greatest capital good, the great “general-purpose technology” of the industrial revolution.49 The continuous rotary motion of steam powered a great variety of industrial processes, spillovers of “innovational complementarities.” The Rhode Island inventor George Corliss developed a new stationary steam engine that provided greater regularity of motion, as well as the ability, through the automatic “governor cutoff,” to handle sudden changes in load (a special advantage in steel rolling mills). Cutoff mechanisms replaced the need for children to perform the same tasks. ([Location 5137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5137))
- The Corliss engine increased energy transmission by 50 percent. In 1870, the year Corliss’s patents expired, steam power in U.S. manufacturing finally exceeded waterpower. In New England’s Lowell textile mills, steam power first supplemented waterpower in 1867 when the waterways froze, but soon the mills switched over to steam completely.50 Coal-fired and steam-powered industrialization had triumphed. ([Location 5142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5142))
- 1870 was the year that coal surpassed all other energy sources in U.S. manufacturing, but it still accounted for only 25 percent of all energy use. 1885 was probably the year fossil fuels became the dominant energy source. ([Location 5160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5160))
- Carnegie, although hardly a representative case, was emblematic of the distinctive characteristics of industrialization. Different varieties of industrialism—especially smaller-scale, “free labor” versions, with roots in the antebellum period—still thrived in the second half of the nineteenth century. Which version won out was a matter of politics as much as economics or the dictates of energy regimes. This struggle—over the property ownership of the new capital goods, the distribution of social power in the workplace, and the terms of the post–Civil War monetary and credit system—will be discussed in the next chapter. Nevertheless, during the 1880s, the decade of Carnegie’s triumphs, a geographically distinct “manufacturing belt” began to fill the American map—“one large district.”56 It spanned the Northeast and Midwest, forming an “approximate parallelogram with corners at Green Bay, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Portland (Maine).” ([Location 5170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5170))
- By 1900, this territory, one-sixth of the national landmass, would be responsible for 80 percent of U.S. industrial production.58 Soon enough, by any criterion, it would be the most productive industrial region in the entire world. ([Location 5178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5178))
- Due to expensive fixed capital investments, once in place many industrial firms warded off potential competitors. Notably, the presence of railroads decisively shaped industrial locations. ([Location 5183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5183))
- The sequence of industrial development was a matter of geography.60 The extent of market access remained crucial. The paths cut by the transportation infrastructure during the era of “internal improvements” were great predictors of successful postbellum industrial location. In this respect, the Civil War proved decisive. Harmed by the conflict, the South fell back, as for decades Birmingham, Alabama, steelworks and piedmont textile mills would be the only significant southern dots on the national industrial map. ([Location 5185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5185))
- to recoup their fixed and running costs, railroads offered freight rebates and other subsidies to existing large producers who could guarantee them steady freight and thus revenue. That made it more difficult for new entrants in industrial production to sufficiently scale up their enterprises. ([Location 5196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5196))
- For instance, the Ohioan John D. Rockefeller bargained with the railroads for such rebates, and by 1880 he controlled 90 percent of U.S. petroleum production capacity. ([Location 5198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5198))
- Having invested in the new capital goods, many of the larger firms in the manufacturing belt settled in place, determined to realize profits from their past sunk investments. Accordingly, smaller firms located around larger, successful firms. A lot of productive capital fixed on the ground, as an industrial geography that would last until World War II settled in place. ([Location 5200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5200))
- Connecting the Northeast and the Midwest was an industrial corridor that first arose along the Erie Canal. During the 1880s, Buffalo, with easy access to New York iron ore and Pennsylvania bituminous coal, surpassed Rochester and Albany in industrial might and was home to the state’s largest iron and steel mills. ([Location 5215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5215))
- No one had ever seen anything like Chicago, the world’s fastest-growing city during the Age of Capital.69 Born a commercial hub of the Old Northwest, Chicago became something more, and something new, an industrial city of unprecedented spatial organization and scale. What made it possible were the combined emergent properties of the industrial economy of coal, steam, iron, and steel. ([Location 5226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5226))
- In 1848 the Illinois and Michigan Canal cleared an inland waterway between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, and as a result of this internal improvement, Chicago vied with St. Louis, long the hub of the Indian fur trade, to become the “gateway city” to the West. The processing of primary commodities—flour mills, lumber mills, breweries, and meatpackers—made Chicago a significant manufacturing center, although Cincinnati surpassed it for many years. ([Location 5230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5230))
- Railroad traffic first made Chicago an economic center.72 The city became the “break point” for eastern trunk lines and western Granger roads. All east-west and west-east routes terminated in the city. By 1889 Chicago’s switching district covered four hundred square miles. Roughly 15 percent of world railway mileage passed through the city, and the Chicago railyards were the greatest anywhere. ([Location 5235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5235))
- The goods and people carried by the railroads terminated in Chicago as well. Farm products required handling and warehousing. In addition to western farm products, northeastern industrial products and northeastern and European finance capital arrived.73 The railroad repair yards alone made Chicago’s heavy industries formidable. Already by 1870, Chicago was exporting finished industrial products from the city. ([Location 5239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5239))
- In industrial Chicago, the increased scale of manufacturing, as well the railroad and the urban streetcar, stretched the urban geography. During the daytime, Chicagoans traveled across long distances—first by horse, then by streetcar. Carnegie steel provided the structural supports for Chicago’s elevated subway system. Different activities separated into different areas—an urban, architectural industrial sphering. The capital goods of industry had their own site of operations, physically separated from commercial and residential life.76 Boulevards and other physical barriers separated the Loop, the central business district, where commercial, retail, and financial services concentrated, from the rail depots, the central manufacturing district, and the infamous Union Stockyards. More boundaries, in turn, separated these spaces from highly segregated residential areas—Chicago’s Gold Coast, home to the lakeshore elite, and the Pilsen neighborhood, home to Czech stockyard workers. Working-class neighborhoods were, essentially, toxic industrial waste dumps. ([Location 5249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5249))
- Due to their potentially multiplying effects, commerce and manufacturing bring increasing returns to economic activity. In agriculture, however, diminishing returns always loom. There is only so much land on the face of the earth, and some parts of it are less capable of yielding a bounty than others.

- There was one notable difference. U.S. agriculture was far more globalized and was subject to the competitive pressures of international markets and pricing. U.S. manufacturing was largely domestically financed, protected by the Republican tariff, and it relied on domestic sources of demand. Further, as Carnegie’s system illustrated, costs determined pricing. ([Location 5311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5311))
- By contrast, while the agricultural industry dominated U.S. exports, farmers at this time had no choice but to accept the international prices for their goods. ([Location 5313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5313))
- Twinning with industrialization, the white settler-colonialism of the Age of Capital saw a great land grab all over the globe, with the goal of extracting the resources necessary for industrialization. The U.S. West simply did it all at the greatest scale. ([Location 5317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5317))
- But “what European miners had done over the span of several centuries, the Americans accomplished in little more than in a single generation.” The Comstock silver lode was discovered in Nevada in 1859; gold in Montana in 1862; silver in Utah, 1869; gold in the Black Hills of Dakota, 1874. Colorado’s coalfields opened in the 1860s and ’70s. During the 1880s, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada began to dominate lead mining. Michigan and Wisconsin ranges were the largest sources of iron ore, until the Mesabi range of northern Minnesota opened. Midwestern petroleum fields dominated until the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Texas, in 1901, soon followed by California exploration.96 By 1900, the United States led the world in the extraction of industrial minerals—ranking first in coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, silver, tungsten, molybdenum, petroleum, arsenic, phosphate, antimony, magnetite, mercury, and salt, as well as a close second place in gold and bauxite.

- In the Age of Commerce, farm households typically employed commercial safety-first strategies. Farming in the Age of Capital was a different project. West of the Mississippi, prairies gave way to plains. There was no timber on hand for construction, and fewer waterways. Without railroads, there was no market access. The bull-tongued, cast-iron sheathed wooden plow could not break plains sods. Of necessity, more farm inputs and outputs now passed through commercial markets. The farm household’s split gambler-peasant economic personality passed from the scene. ([Location 5353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5353))
- the West, fixed running costs had another logic. A steel plow was a sunk cost, and mortgages demanded payment. To recoup costs and pay their debts, farmers produced regardless of the price offered for their products—just as railroad corporations ran their cars, no matter how full. Thus did the West unleash torrents of commodities onto world markets. ([Location 5384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5384))

- Merchants began selling the elevator certificates as speculative objects, then created “futures” contracts, to price and trade commodities that did not yet exist. Futures enabled farmers to hedge their products in the fields against price fluctuations. No less, it allowed merchants and dealers, even the public at large, to speculate on futures prices in the “pits.” ([Location 5399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5399))
- The Union Stockyards were capitalized in 1865 at a gargantuan $1 million fixed cost by the Chicago Pork Packers’ Association and the city’s nine largest railroad corporations. These stockyards could handle over 100,000 animals. In a premonition of Henry Ford’s assembly line, workers struck hogs on the head with mallets, then hooked them onto a mechanized “disassembly line,” feet first—cutting their jugulars to bleed out the animals to death. Cattle, by contrast, were simply bludgeoned until dead. ([Location 5433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5433))

- On the southern plains, cattle overgrazing led ranchers to drive herds northward. In the two unusually harsh winters of 1886 and 1887, as many as one million cattle perished in what came to be known as the “Great Die Up.” Fleeing winter storms, cattle blindly piled into farmers’ barbed-wire fences, where, trapped, they froze to death.

- Also uncommonly, he was willing to negotiate with labor unions, including the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, formed in 1876. The Amalgamated was a “craft union,” consisting of highly skilled, highly knowledgeable male laborers who combined to bargain with their employers over wages and working conditions.142 In 1878 Carnegie had instructed Captain Bill Jones to cut wage expenditures, but Jones shot back, “Leave good enough alone.” “Low wages,” he lectured Carnegie, “does not always imply cheap labor. Good wages and good workmen I know to be cheapest labor.” ([Location 5487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5487))

- Falling steel prices were the fruits of the company’s productivity gains, delivered to its owners. Carnegie believed that workers’ wages should fall accordingly. But sliding wages threatened the aspirations of young, transient, single male wage earners, who perhaps hoped to earn and then quickly move on (if not migrate back to Europe). For married men, lower pay threatened their breadwinning ability—another common aspiration of working people, who sought to prevent their wives from leaving the home and entering the sphere of remunerative labor that according to middle-class prescription was supposed to be only for men. If husbands could not earn a breadwinning wage, wives, perhaps even children, might need to endure the middle-class indignity of working for wages.

- In 1892 alone state militias intervened to put down strikes on twenty-three separate occasions.12 The Homestead strike followed nearly two decades of labor strife, which had begun, no less dramatically, in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873 with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

- New industrial cities were the chief arenas of conflict, and municipal authorities struggled to contain the violence.14 In Pittsburgh, a crowd of workers and sympathizers, many women and children, blockaded the Pennsylvania Railroad’s freight yard. The Pittsburgh police, in solidarity with the strikers, would not act. State militiamen arrived, bayoneted a few protesters, and fired on the crowd, killing twenty. Angry mobs, in the thousands, chased the six hundred militiamen into a roundhouse, where they barricaded themselves, clinging to a Gatling gun. The mob destroyed more than two thousand railcars, one hundred locomotives, and nearly forty buildings, and they tore up the tracks of a three-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

- For the labor strife of the Age of Capital, we must turn to Karl Marx’s Capital (1867).21 Capital was a “critique” of Smith’s political economy but also, like it, a thought experiment that sought to capture the logic of a competitive economic system unhindered by outside interference. To Marx, capitalism, left to its own devices, would lead to endemic class struggle. ([Location 5647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5647))
- For the sake of this theory, Marx generally assumed that capitalists would always invest in capital goods, that industrial investment would never be lacking. Liquidity preference—money acting as a safe haven store of value, for either precautionary or speculative motives, rather than as an investable means of achieving more surplus value—is excluded by assumption. ([Location 5664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5664))
- Note that, whereas the Smithian dynamics of the Age of Commerce were spatial, the dynamics of Marx’s economic system were of time alone. He was concerned with the rate of exploitation over time, the systemic urge toward the constant increase of productivity over time, and ultimately an economic future—Communism—that would be qualitatively different from the present. ([Location 5681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5681))
- Capital presents a theory of a specific kind of productive asset, industrial capital goods. The time signature is linear and rather fated. Nonetheless, the book is full of insights about the kind of capital that, after all, was at the heart of the industrial revolution. ([Location 5687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5687))
- Setting aside the ultimate validity of Marx’s theory, the late-nineteenth-century U.S. industrial economy was something like a caricature of Capital. Much as Marx predicted, industrialization led to a system-wide drive to produce more wealth. But many U.S. industrial capitalists kept complaining about their profit margins. The United States had the world’s longest workday, ten hours in 1880, and capitalists and workers fought over its length (absolute surplus value).27 The implementation of the new capital goods in the workplace brought no less tension (relative surplus value). It all culminated in dramatic strikes and periodic violence. There was a lot of class conflict. ([Location 5704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5704))
- aggregate, total output and money incomes increased, but so what? By many indices, the first generation of industrial Americans fared worse than their more rural forebears. They were shorter in height and sicker, ate less nutritious foods, lived in crowded unsanitary homes, and died younger. Infant mortality increased (probably because of bad milk).31 The trends did not reverse until 1890 at the earliest.32 For this generation of proletarians, Marx’s “immiseration” thesis did not look so bad. ([Location 5719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5719))
- During the course of U.S. industrialization, a political rallying cry—“free labor”—functioned both as a benchmark to assess the worth of economic life and as a plausible ideal worth striving for. In contradistinction to chattel slavery, “free labor,” as it emerged during the Republican mobilization of the 1850s, contained a core principle of aspirational upward mobility—hope. ([Location 5728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5728))
- Lincoln himself had said that wage labor was supposed to be a temporary status. The goal was ownership of productive property. This was a politics of property. In the United States, ever since the seventeenth century, white male heads of household had enjoyed, relative to those in other societies, widespread property ownership in land. Would such a distribution continue in the new era of industrial capital goods? Or would some men, the capitalists, corner the market in the ownership of capital goods and force others to permanently work for wages? ([Location 5732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5732))
- Increasingly, unskilled operatives in factories were European immigrants, whose preference was for long hours of work and the highest possible wage, regardless of working conditions, because their aspiration was not to own and operate their own businesses, as proprietors, but rather to return to Europe with money in their pockets.34 Their outlook and preferences disrupted U.S. labor-organizing efforts. The immigrant return rate was 10 percent in the 1870s, but it would approach 70 percent in the early twentieth century. ([Location 5738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5738))
- Industry also created demand for unskilled wage-earning operatives at the bottom of the distribution, who in 1870 were already 63.4 percent of the manufacturing workforce. Immigrants would increasingly fill these ranks. Much like the service economy of the twenty-first century, industrialization threatened to hollow out the middle strata. Nonetheless, in 1870, 31.8 percent of the manufacturing workforce—not white collar—was still “skilled.”37 This group included the middling artisan or craftsman—the modest, small-scale owner of capital who employed but few men in his shop. ([Location 5748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5748))
- Surely, familiarity with Marx was not necessary to develop a critique of the inequities of industrial change. American critics were more likely to look backward—to the revolutionary inheritance of Thomas Jefferson’s “labor republicanism,” and to the politics of widespread white male property ownership—than to look forward to any socialist, communist, or anarchist utopia.

- They believed that the new capital goods should be treated as the land was previously. First, capital goods should be widely distributed. Second, while they were capital, a means of production, they should also be something more: property that guaranteed equal democratic citizenship. Desire for the “manly” ownership of property—regardless of any rate of pecuniary profit—mingled with the profit motive and was a critical component of a popular inducement to invest in industry, different from Carnegie’s.

- this “free labor” vision, the issue of pay—the wage, no matter how high—was simply not enough. This politics of property sought to politicize the ownership of industrial capital itself. ([Location 5774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=5774))
- In the early 1890s, in the absence of major recent world gold discoveries and in the wake of a surge in silver mining in the U.S. West, the market ratio of gold to silver hovered near 30 to 1. “Silverites” decrying the “Crime of ’73” demanded that the U.S. Mint freely coin silver at 16 to 1. That would enrich silver producers but also increase the U.S. hard money supply, reflate prices, prompt credit expansion, and ease the economic depression.

- In the era of industrialization, the household remained the central unit of U.S. farm enterprise. In 1880, 43.8 percent of Americans—22 million people—lived on farms. ([Location 6336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6336))
- The American farm sector was the great agricultural powerhouse of world markets, which were both globalized and highly competitive. ([Location 6338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6338))
- After a harvest, farmers were forced to accept a competitive world market price for their crops. Farmers in this era grew wealthier in absolute terms. But relatively, industry captured a larger share of the newfound productivity gains, due to increasing returns in commerce and manufacturing.17 While many farmers were in debt, the great railroad corporations, which farmers depended on to take their crops to market—and which set prices for their customers based on their own costs rather than being forced to take a competitive market price, as farmers were—grew rich. Bankers, who controlled farmers’ access to credit, increased their own incomes. ([Location 6340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6340))
- due to the interactions of the gold standard, high debt loads, railroad pricing strategies, and competitive world market prices, the grievances of many small-scale commercial farmers were real. In the South, the unjust and inefficient crop lien system, which crowded black and white sharecroppers into producing cotton, was to blame. Cotton was an international commodity, but the South remained cut off from national labor markets and, to a lesser degree, from international capital markets. With the entry of Egyptian and Indian cotton onto the world market, demand proved insufficient, and the price of cotton fell, which exacerbated southern debt burdens.

- In the Age of Capital, the United States was a world agricultural powerhouse, exporting great volumes of many commodities. But in tandem with U.S. commitment to the deflationary gold standard, greater production contributed to falling prices, which exacerbated the debt burdens of many farmers.

- The railroad corporations contributed to the farmers’ troubles. The Farmers’ Alliance charged the railroads with discriminating against small, rural customers, a violation of property owners’ equality of commercial opportunity. The antimonopoly charge evoked Jacksonian Democracy but also the post–Civil War Granger movement. Granger laws, which had passed in many midwestern states, forbade railroad rate discrimination. ([Location 6392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6392))
- The Farmers’ Alliance politicized railroad rate setting. During the Age of Capital, there was no farming—no life at all, including social connection—in the West without the market access provided by railroad corporations (just as in the early twenty-first century for many people, there is no social life without the Internet). For farmers, the railroads’ power to set rates truly was extraordinary. In many farming communities, one single railroad corporation provided market access. For a railroad, being the first to enter a particular territory and establish a line there warded off potential future competition. In the absence of market competition, it could set rates. ([Location 6401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6401))
- In the West, given the absence of waterways, there was no market access without the railroads. Illustrated here is the American railroad network by century’s end, but also the extraordinary power that the great railroad corporations exercised over commercial farmers in the Plains states, the hotbed of the Populist Revolt.

- On economic grounds, the railroads were what the University of Michigan professor of political economy Henry Carter Adams, in an influential essay, “Relation of the State to Industrial Action” (1887), branded a “natural monopoly.”24 Given increasing returns to scale in railroading, first movers always threatened to capture a monopolistic share of a market. Rather than receiving market prices, the railroads—just like many large industrial producers—set prices according to their own costs. As they had large, fixed, and running costs, they preferred large customers who could guarantee them freight. Thus they commonly offered them lower rates, relative to smaller farmers, who suffered commercially from such “discrimination.” ([Location 6411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6411))
- In 1890 Democratic votes pushed through the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which mandated that the federal government purchase and mint a greater quantity of silver—pushing back somewhat against silver’s postwar demonetization. That same year Democrats also pushed through the Sherman Antitrust Act, which granted the Department of Justice legal authority to quash contracts or combinations “in restraint of trade or commerce.” ([Location 6458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6458))
- In 1911 the U.S. Supreme Court in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States broke up Rockefeller’s New Jersey holding company.

- Taking up the Populist cause, although more in cities than in the West, Progressives transformed the concept of “natural monopoly” into the associated notion of a “public utility” corporation. 90 In 1905–7 they largely lost the battle for municipal ownership of streetcars and subways, but the capital of privately owned “utilities”—the municipal infrastructure of transportation, gas, waterworks, and sewage—became newly affected with the “public interest.” ([Location 6743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6743))

- As a number of homegrown U.S. monetary theorists argued, a truly central bank would have the public authority to be the “lender of last resort” in such crises. Further, by setting a short-term interest rate in the money market, if need be, it could raise rates and draw sufficient gold into the country to defend the dollar-gold exchange rate. Last, within the limit set by the quantity of gold, by accepting a variety of bills and notes as collateral for loans, a central bank would have the power to issue credit and thus to expand the money supply, to prevent any reversal in the credit cycle that risked panic and precautionary hoarding.

- The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, passed because of agrarian political power in Congress, created something different from what either monetary theorists or Wall Street bankers had wanted—twelve regional reserve banks. These “banker’s banks” accepted the deposits and discounted the notes of other banks. By law, the national banks had to purchase stock in the twelve reserve banks and hold their reserves in them. Ownership came with voting rights to determine the board members and governors of the regional reserve banks. The regional banks printed federal reserve notes, which replaced the national banknotes and became the sole U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve was required to have 40 percent of the currency backed by gold reserves. Each regional bank had the discretion to set its own interest rates on loans to its members. Immediately, given the importance of the Wall Street capital market, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became the most powerful of the twelve banks. The president appointed and the Senate confirmed a seven-member board to oversee the Federal Reserve. ([Location 6777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6777))

- Profit was far too narrow an aim for Ford’s massive, homespun ego. A far more grandiose motivation fired his extraordinary dedication to investing in mass production. He was not conflicted about short-term speculation versus long-term investment—let alone hoarding. He associated short-term profit making in liquid financial markets with the “International Jew” and never participated in it, ([Location 6830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6830))
- Ford, in the beginning an industrial tinkerer in the small-scale-producer tradition, was enamored with production and nothing else. In this respect, he had a singular, focused drive and was committed—like no capitalist before or since, not even Andrew Carnegie—to putting productive capital on the ground, over the long term, in order to produce, produce, and produce. In doing so, he himself concluded, “I invented the modern age.” ([Location 6834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6834))
- The electrification of assembly in the 1910s and ’20s gave rise to even greater capital deepening, and stupendous gains in productivity occurred.13 From negligible amounts in 1900, electricity powered 78 percent of U.S. industry by 1929.14 During the 1920s, U.S. manufacturing productivity increased at an annual rate in excess of 5 percent—the fastest rate of growth of any decade on record. ([Location 6841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6841))
- This type of worker, like a good soldier, stood at an assembly line. In return for his obedience and consent, he earned a breadwinning wage—after work, he could buy the new consumer goods of the Machine Age. ([Location 6880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=6880))
- As the company mechanized production, it ceased to employ skilled machinists, and turned to unskilled male “new immigrants” (Ford would not employ married women on principle), which complemented his productive capital goods.55 In 1914 U.S.-born workers accounted for only 29 percent of Ford’s labor force. The remaining 71 percent was represented by more than twenty-two nationalities, the most common being Poles, Russians, Romanians, Italians, and Hungarians. The language barrier alone made organizing difficult, but there was “No talking!” on the line anyway. ([Location 7069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7069))
- Ever since the rise of U.S. “free labor” norms before the Civil War, the U.S. labor market had featured a high rate of mobility and turnover for young, male, especially immigrant workers. Turnover at Ford was shockingly high. Every day in 1913 between 1,300 and 1,400 workers did not show up to work—about 10 percent of the entire workforce. Labor turnover was a staggering 370 percent. ([Location 7076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7076))
- As for what skilled labor was left—machinists, molders, platers, and polishers—the AFL attempted to organize them. All efforts foundered, however, on the final cog in Ford’s assembly line, the five-dollar day. ([Location 7081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7081))
- Basically, to keep the line moving, Ford bought off his workforce. He preempted the AFL’s politics of pay with his own brand of income politics. Unlike Carnegie, he would hand over a portion of his expanding profits. To great public fanfare, he announced the five-dollar day on January 5, 1914. Work was reduced from nine hours a day to eight. Daily pay for unskilled workers doubled from $2.50 to $5. Job application lines quickly ran out the door of the Ford employment department, and by 1915 labor turnover was down to 16 percent.58 ([Location 7083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7083))
- another line of thought, Ford realized that if he did not pay his workers high enough wages, they would not be able to afford to buy his cars. That Ford was manufacturing a consumer good as opposed to an intermediate capital good was of great significance. Mass production would usher in an era of mass consumption, in which consumerism joined commerce and industrial investment among dynamic economic factors. ([Location 7090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7090))
- Another motivation behind the five-dollar day was that mass production was vulnerable to mass labor action. The assembly line demanded productivity, but it also demanded machine-like cooperation. It only took one worker, no matter how unskilled, to hold up the line. Mass production would indeed prove quite vulnerable to industrial unionism and mass strikes. At this point, Ford was willing to pay for peace. ([Location 7094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7094))
- Ford had a final motivation: he was also in the business of producing men. The five dollars were not a daily wage. A portion was called a profit share, granted only under certain conditions. The worker had to live the right way, as the company’s “sociology department” administered the five-dollar-day program. As one Ford manager explained, an unskilled worker received “$2.34 per day for working” and “another $2.66 for living as the company wanted him to live.” “Drinking” and “riotous living” were forbidden, as were “lack of thrift,” “domestic trouble,” and “indebtedness.” The sociology department conducted home inspections, such that “there was nothing to keep from them.” “This man lives in a dirty unsanitary hut,” Ford records read. Or “Polish wedding, Drunk.” “My wife told them everything,” one worker lamented. Ford’s vision was total. ([Location 7109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7109))
- It was as if the assembly line extended outside the factory gates and into working-class homes, even into working-class saloons, where it yanked the beer right out of Ford employees’ hands. ([Location 7117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7117))
- In December 1915, Ford financed the Peace Ship and personally traveled to Europe on a publicity campaign to talk soldiers out of the trenches. That did not work. The U.S. economy boomed, exporting raw materials to Great Britain and France. Wall Street financed their war debts. German militarists judged that U.S. economic power, even under a neutral flag, might eventually tip the balance, and so Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare against U.S. ships. Congress voted to enter the war in April 1917. The United States did help tip the balance, and an armistice was declared in November 1918.

- two of Ford’s original investors, the Dodge brothers, owned 10 percent of the company and did not want all profits reinvested in the construction of the Rouge.

- By now, mass production was clearly the future of industry. The Great Bull Market of the 1920s at the New York Stock Exchange began, and Ford’s chief competitor, General Motors, was among its darlings. The Ford Motor Company was an anomaly. Ford had secured complete control. ([Location 7171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7171))
- Between 1917 and 1920, Ford invested $60 million in the Rouge.72 Arguably, this was the greatest single outlay of fixed capital investment in all of history. ([Location 7173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7173))

- In 1920, in unison with the Bank of England’s effort to restore the pre–World War I gold standard, pillar of the British Empire, the Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates. To return currencies to their prewar levels of exchange parity with gold, everywhere the money and credit supply would have to shrink. The scarcity value of money capital would be enforced. It was the post–Civil War policy of resumption all over again. A punishing deflation set in. Money, credit, and economic activity constricted. Unemployment neared 9 percent.

- No less remarkable was the sheer physical massing of productive capital. Ford had fixed, and settled, prodigious amounts of illiquid capital goods in place. There would be no pulling out of the investment anytime soon. ([Location 7237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7237))
- The first generation to live through industrialization often experienced it as uprootedness—perhaps from rural life and the stolidity of the land. Many of Ford’s workers were European peasants. Nonetheless, when gazing up at the Rouge, it was hard not to think that, after the rupture of industrial revolution, the time horizon was now extending, and that economic life was at last settling down into a long-term structure. ([Location 7247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7247))

- With the closing of European immigration due to World War I, followed by the exclusionary Immigration Act of 1924, Ford began to hire thousands of black workers of the great migration out of the South. Blacks became 10 percent of Ford’s workforce. ([Location 7322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7322))
- After 1921, General Motors was under the controlling interest of a Delaware explosives manufacturer, the DuPont Company. GM’s Chevrolet model began to compete with the Model T. GM’s mass production methods were more flexible. It built more lines of cars, catering to different consumer market niches. Grudgingly, Ford began to paint the Model T different colors. GM also encouraged its customers to buy on credit. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) launched in 1919. Ford was against debt on principle, although his son Edsel quietly opened a credit agency, the Guaranty Trust Company, on a different set of books. ([Location 7343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7343))
- By 1929, Ford and GM each had 35 percent of the automobile market. Production was Ford’s metric of industrial success, but Ford’s pecuniary revenues were half those of GM. GM was a much more profitable corporation. ([Location 7351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7351))
- In 1923 MIT graduate Alfred Sloan became the Detroit-based president of GM. The corporation developed a sophisticated hierarchy, with power and authority vested in impersonal titles and offices—which was the ongoing corporate trend.110 Mechanization created great demand for skilled, white-collar workers.111 Vice presidents, managers, middle managers, and associates piled into head offices, sitting in standardized chairs, at standardized desks, in standardized office cubicles.112 In a mass society, paradoxically faceless bureaucracy and the cultural celebrity of a figure like Ford arose in tandem.

    - **Note:** Surely this is a good comment on post-modernity, too, to the extent that it challenges the notions of progress and the valuation of efficiency
- the great leap forward in the rest of U.S. industrial production during the 1920s was sustained by yet another upswing in the repeating capitalist credit cycle, another speculative boom. On the NYSE, it was the decade of the Great Bull Market, which followed a surge in investor confidence after the post–World War I restoration of the gold standard. ([Location 7386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7386))
- by now the United States was at the center of global finance. After World War I, the world owed the country $12 billion. The United States sat on most of the world’s gold reserves, and the Federal Reserve was newly burdened by the responsibility of maintaining the worldwide gold standard. ([Location 7389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7389))
- First, industrial revolution took place. Due to fixed investment in production, capital settled into more energy-intensive, illiquid capital goods. Over time, labor productivity increased on the supply side, and through long-term industrial economic development, wealth and money incomes grew—even though they were more inequitably distributed, relative to the past. ([Location 7398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7398))
- Second, the capitalist credit cycle repeated. Here the timing was not linear. Periods of short-term speculative investment booms motivated industrial economic development, accelerating industrial revolution, but these episodes were followed by moments of panic and the competitive flight to safe liquid assets. Precautionary hoarding prevailed, demand collapsed, and development decelerated. Entrepreneurial energy enervated, as long-term investment in productive capital halted. Economic life was nervously pulled into the present, before confidence returned. ([Location 7400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7400))
- Once again, in 1920, a postwar return to the gold standard led to a price deflation, which fueled a surge in psychological confidence among the owners of capital—who guarded the scarcity value of their money capital.

- During the 1920s, a great speculative upswing unfolded across all sectors.

- The initiating cause of the Great Depression was governments’ insistence on restoring the pre–World War I gold standard, which necessitated very high central bank interest rates. Thus what drove the great investment boom of the 1920s was borrowing on very high interest rates. High rates created a high bar for future expected profits. But expectations during the 1920s were sufficiently high to bring about an unusual moment in capital and credit markets—a moment of abundant but expensive credit. (There had been a moment like this after the Civil War, and there would be another moment in the 1980s.)4 ([Location 7427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7427))
- During the 1920s, debt-fueled borrowing and speculation did lead to long-term Machine Age investments. The cumulative, multiplying process of industrial investment in capital goods increased productivity and growth. But with money borrowed at such high rates, if the credit cycle reversed, the aftermath was likely to be ugly: the calling in of expensive loans, panic, a flight to security, and the kind of liquidity preference—precautionary—that does not lead to fixed investment in production and that undermines the use of existing capital equipment.5 Demand for goods would evaporate, as spending of all kinds—and thus production, output, and employment—would go into reverse. ([Location 7433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7433))
- That was what happened: when expectations of future profits dampened, the credit cycle did reverse. U.S. fixed investment started declining in February 1929, months before the Great Crash of the NYSE in October. As expectations shifted, agricultural prices collapsed, and the drop in farm incomes further diminished demand for manufactured goods. The industrial and agricultural sectors strained against each other. ([Location 7438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7438))

- A fearful, precautionary liquidity preference among the owners of capital broke out. They would not part with money to invest capital in employment-giving production. Economic life suffered from a lack of psychic energy. Existing factories and willing workers sat by, idle and unoccupied. Something would have to come from outside the economic system to bring back demand and prompt a full-fledged recovery in production.

- A great post–World War I cycle of price inflation and deflation extended during the early 1920s. Everywhere peace first brought inflation.

- The United States was responsible for 60 percent of all international loans between 1924 and 1931.15 U.S. capital financed European reconstruction.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt called him “a wonder,” exclaiming, “I wish we could make him President of the United States. There could not be a better one.” ([Location 7675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7675))
- The era’s great admiration for energy in machines and in power utilities carried over to the vigorous figure of Hoover. In 1920 he supported Republican Warren Harding’s candidacy for president, and upon his election he became secretary of commerce—“and Undersecretary of all other Departments,” as one official put it.57 After Harding’s death, he continued to actively serve under President Coolidge, who by contrast was a taker of prodigious White House naps. ([Location 7678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7678))
- In economic policy, Hoover sponsored what 1920s academic and policy circles called the “new economics.”58 According to this view, during World War I, military urgency and paper credit had ramped up production so much as to prove that nations had greater economic capacities than previously thought. Intelligent human action could transcend dismal economic laws. Empirical economic investigation and statistical analysis, leading to greater efficiency, could raise economic output. ([Location 7682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7682))
- Even business cycles could be evened out with better information. During slumps, for instance, government might spend more on commercially viable public works that employed people. Hoover called for a politics of “administrative intelligence.” ([Location 7688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7688))
- Government should aid private industry, Hoover believed, but never coerce it. In his short book American Individualism (1922), he argued that the growth of government coercion in industrial societies, especially the Russian Bolshevik menace, threatened the “divine spark” within every individual. Individualism must not come to mean “selfish snatching,” which was incompatible with “capitalism,” allowing a “few men through unrestrained control of property determine the welfare of great numbers.” Rather, self-interest must be checked. ([Location 7690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7690))

- In April 1929, Hoover called Congress into special session, and in June he signed the Agricultural Marketing Act. The U.S. Treasury would inject $500 million of capital into a new Federal Farm Board to finance agricultural cooperatives (an old Populist demand) that might buy and store farm products, to counter price deflation. The Farm Board realized Hoover’s vision of a mixed public and private “associational state.” ([Location 7708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7708))
- Agreeing in principle with Mellon, a number of other economic thinkers proposed, too, that only from widespread bankruptcy could general prosperity ever return. For on this account, the cause of the crisis was overinvestment in an inflationary boom, which called for less investment after the bust. The purge of the system would re-equilibrate savings and investment at a higher rate of interest and at lower prices, including wages. ([Location 7718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7718))
- But it would restore economic health and prompt a natural recovery. Among economists, the Austrian Friedrich Hayek’s Prices and Production (1931), the Englishman Arthur Pigou’s The Theory of Unemployment (1933), and the Englishman Lionel Robbins’s The Great Depression (1934) all generally diagnosed the slump this way. ([Location 7721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7721))
- Most important, the market autocorrection of the “real” economy must occur without government interference. These were very sophisticated logical arguments, made by very intelligent economists, in defense of economic suffering. They were wrong. ([Location 7723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7723))
- The problem was not profligate excess. What they diagnosed as overinvestment is better characterized as speculative misinvestment. In a monetary economy, when a credit-fueled speculative investment boom gives way to the precautionary hoarding of liquid assets, the problem in the bust then becomes underinvestment. Out of fear, the owners of capital refuse to invest. Liquid assets lock up purchasing power. Demand suffers, and so does output and employment. Not only are fresh investments not made. Existing capacity—perfectly good factories, perfectly willing workers—needlessly idles. ([Location 7725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7725))
- The general problem was not that something outside the real economy was preventing markets from autocorrecting. Something within capitalist enterprise itself was stuck, and required a jolt. ([Location 7730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7730))
- Hoover believed his “associational state” transcended the Jacksonian sphering of public and private, state and market, which, under the banner of equal commercial opportunity, had withered state action throughout the Age of Capital. But he drew one line in the sand: he would not coerce capitalists to invest. ([Location 7743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7743))
- Hoover also dispatched telegrams to governors saying it would “be helpful if road, street, public building and other construction of this type could be speeded up and adjusted in such fashion to further employment.”72 Between 1929 and 1930, state and local expenditures as shares of GDP climbed from 7.4 percent to 9.0 percent, but many states had Progressive reform-era balanced-budget laws and eroding tax bases. They could not take on debt. ([Location 7753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7753))
- There was no notion yet of a potential “fiscal multiplier” in the midst of the Depression—the idea that increased government spending might actually increase private expenditures and tax receipts, not only compensate for them. ([Location 7756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7756))
- Hoover further implored private nonprofit corporations to provide relief to the growing ranks of the unemployed. With capital failing, perhaps philanthropic wealth could fill the breach. The Rockefellers kicked in $1 million in New York. When Henry Ford was approached in Detroit, he refused, with the bizarre response, “Endowment is an opiate of the imagination, a drug to initiative.” ([Location 7761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7761))
- Given existing government capacities and the president’s ideology, there was not much more to do. Then again, there was not much more that Herbert Hoover believed needed doing. ([Location 7765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7765))
- In the early 1930s, short-term capital movements among countries became, in the words of President Hoover, a “loose cannon on the deck of the world in a tempest-tossed era.”75 Nonetheless, Hoover’s own commitment to the gold standard destroyed the U.S. economy and with it his presidency. ([Location 7773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7773))
- Whether out of sheer panic or a belief that Germany was now following a renegade path, half of Germany’s gold reserves now left the country. It could not make its outstanding reparations payments. In June, Hoover announced a plan to delay all political debt payments, including German reparations. France balked, but by July, when it finally agreed to suspend a portion of Germany’s political debts, the German financial system had already collapsed. ([Location 7784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7784))
- In the last two weeks of July, the Bank of England lost half of its gold reserves—$250 billion—to capital flight. Nervously, investors shifted their gold to other countries. Without gold in British bank vaults, the fixed convertibility of the pound was at risk. ([Location 7798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7798))
- the British government. In three weeks it was all gone. In late September, fully spent, Britain suspended gold convertibility for the pound. ([Location 7802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7802))
- The British departure from the gold standard was an event of historic proportions. The international gold standard was a British imperial institution and an anchor of pre–World War I globalization—an era of low interest rates and much international investment. ([Location 7803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7803))
- But U.S. reserves still had plenty of gold bullion. Nonetheless, if destabilized by short-term capital flight, the U.S. banking system now collapsed from a source within. ([Location 7817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7817))
- by the summer of 1931, the Farm Board had given up. It stopped accumulating stocks, waiting for prices to rise. Instead, it threw stored farm products onto the market, further deflating commodity prices and thus jeopardizing rural banks. Now the U.S. banking system crashed in a massive popular flight to security. Banks that survived stopped lending and hoarded reserves.90 Credit was rationed regardless of the going rate. ([Location 7833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7833))
- Among ordinary people, a moment of mass, popular precaution had broken out as had never been seen before. At this stage, the Fed committed its worst blunder. ([Location 7845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7845))
- While the Fed had been lowering interest rates, now in October 1931 it raised interest rates from 1.5 to 3.5 percent. This was a grave error, as the restricted supply of credit and money was another blow to spending of all kinds. ([Location 7849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7849))
- In late 1931, to set an example for the world, Hoover drafted the Revenue Act of 1932, calling for higher taxes to balance the federal budget—long the good housekeeping seal of approval for global capital under the gold standard, but exactly the wrong medicine to combat deflation. ([Location 7864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7864))
- Finally in January 1932, Congress created the Hoover-approved Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which had authority to lend up to $1.5 billion but only on a commercially viable basis—it was not “relief.” Congress passed a 1932 law authorizing the Fed to use a wider variety of paper bills as reserves for its own note issues. But the law still declared faith in the gold standard. ([Location 7869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7869))

- there was no short-term interest rate, not even zero, that would induce the owners of capital to part with liquidity. ([Location 7875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7875))
- In November 1932, the return on three-month U.S. Treasury bonds hit 0.05 percent, around which it would hover throughout the 1930s. The Fed’s cautious open market operations—purchasing short-term, near-cash-equivalent securities to prop up their prices and lower their rates—had lost power as early as 1931. ([Location 7876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7876))
- By 1932, no increase in the supply of money could make the owners of capital willing to part with it and spend. Nor could it prompt inflation. Precautionary liquidity preference—the demand for cash and other safe liquid assets—was simply that high. Investors invested in assets with near-zero pecuniary returns. The profit motive had disappeared—or at least, no one believed there were any future profits on offer. ([Location 7878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7878))
- In the history of American capitalism, one may isolate this moment: the liquidity trap of the fall of 1932. From it would issue a long historical arc, into the twenty-first century, from the Great Depression to the Great Recession. Along its path an escape from the liquidity trap would be achieved during World War II, which induced—by public investment—a long-term industrial investment boom in productive capital assets. ([Location 7888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7888))
- Decades after that, the arc would follow the next era of high speculative liquidity preference beginning in the 1980s, then end in the next precautionary liquidity trap, in the fall of 2008, after the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. Capitalism would but barely climb out of the trap in the late 2010s, before it fell back again in 2020. ([Location 7891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7891))
- As for the Great Depression, the numbers from the beginning of the slump in August 1929 until it hit the very bottom in March 1933 are staggering. U.S. consumer expenditures fell from $79 billion to $64.6 billion.104 The value of world trade was down 65 percent.105 U.S. prices dropped 30 percent. U.S. industrial production declined 37 percent. Of the workforce, 22.9 percent were unemployed, and of those employed, one-third worked less than full time. Industrial unemployment hit 37.6 percent. ([Location 7894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7894))
- Economic output fell 52 percent. Farm prices declined by a staggering 65 percent. U.S. corporations, profiting by $10 billion in 1929, suffered losses of $3 billion in 1932. The Dow stock index for the NYSE hit 41, a total loss of 90 percent since the 1929 peak. No fewer than 600,000 homeowners defaulted on mortgages, and $7 billion in deposits were lost. Fortune estimated that 34 million Americans—out of a population of 120 million—had no money income on which to live. ([Location 7898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7898))
- By car, rail, or foot, millions abandoned their homesteads. The largest percentage of rural migrants headed for California. ([Location 7926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7926))
- Cities fared little better. In the winter of 1932, unemployment in Detroit and Chicago reached as high as 50 percent. The most vulnerable—women, children, the elderly, the disabled, minorities—suffered the most. The rate of black unemployment doubled that of white unemployment. Men, women, and children lined up for bread, foraged in streets, rummaged in trash cans, and lived in “rusted-out car bodies” or “shacks made of orange crates.” ([Location 7938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7938))
- Hoover’s political philosophy of “neighborly helpfulness” was stretched beyond its economic limit. Neighborly helpfulness could still go a long way, however. The primal need for human community, its endurance under unspeakable hardship, was, in fact, at the heart of Steinbeck’s two great Depression-era novels, The Grapes of Wrath and the earlier Tortilla Flat (1935). ([Location 7981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7981))

- One of the great tragedies of the Great Depression was that it wiped out large swaths of civil society, the voluntary associations that President Hoover continued to champion.123 Hoover vetoed a 1931 congressional relief bill, partly because he thought relief was not the business of government and partly because fiscal discipline protected the gold standard. He would allow the RFC to loan only small sums to states for unemployment relief. ([Location 7990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=7990))
- organized in unemployed councils and unemployed leagues. In July 1932, most dramatically, 25,000 unemployed World War I veterans marched on Washington, pleading with the federal government to pay them the bonuses they said the government owed them for military service. The “Bonus Army” camped out across the Potomac River in Anacostia, Virginia. General Douglas MacArthur sent in tanks and bayonets, and the Bonus Army disintegrated.

- FDR was nevertheless something Hoover was not—a gifted politician. In 1921 FDR had contracted polio and lost the full use of his legs. Recovery from the disease changed him and granted him his political gift for empathy. Historian David M. Kennedy observed that FDR’s “shallow, supercilious youth” gave way to “the precious gift of a purposeful manhood.” ([Location 8023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8023))
- But one of the candidate’s great political assets was his ideological flexibility. Unlike Hoover, he was not a technocrat. Nor was he an intellectual; hence he was free from the problem that plagues most intellectuals in politics, their almost aesthetic desire for a grand ideological system, in which all the different parts must fit together into a unified whole. When asked during the campaign what his “philosophy” was, FDR responded, “Philosophy? Philosophy? I am a Christian and a Democrat—that’s all.” ([Location 8030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8030))
- Around himself he assembled many advisers, who made different, sometimes contradictory suggestions. Much to their amazement, the candidate would agree with them all. “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “Fine! Fine! Fine!” Thus intellectuals thoroughly underestimated FDR. Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once said of FDR that he had a “second-class intellect” but a “first-class temperament.” Journalist Walter Lippmann referred to the incoming president as “a kind of amiable boy scout,” without “a firm grasp of public affairs and without very strong convictions.” Hoover thought the Democratic nominee a hopeless lightweight. Upon FDR’s landslide victory over him in 1932, he predicted disaster. ([Location 8036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8036))
- Edsel Ford’s Guardian Trust Company, which had financed automobile purchases, failed; the RFC refused it a loan, and Henry Ford, who believed credit was immoral, refused to bail out his son. ([Location 8046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8046))
- Among FDR’s widely commented-upon personal qualities was his bottomless reserve of self-confidence and his almost preternatural sense of calm. In contrast to so many nerve-shot capitalists, according to one of his closest advisers, FDR “had no nerves at all.” In the most memorable line of his inaugural address, he declared that Americans had “nothing to fear but fear itself.” ([Location 8058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8058))
- FDR indicated he would support a provision in Congress’s Emergency Banking Act, enabling the executive to control international and domestic gold movements. The new law granted to the president the power to take the United States off the gold standard. On April 5, 1933, FDR signed an executive order “forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.” ([Location 8062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8062))
- Going off gold was intended to stoke the reflation of national prices and assert political control over the U.S. economy.142 FDR announced a new policy of “definitely controlled inflation.”143 The price of the dollar, now allowed to float in currency and gold markets, quickly devalued with respect to gold and other currencies (against the British pound by 30 percent). U.S. prices across the board began to reflate. Finally a bottom had been reached. In an act of great political courage, FDR broke America’s golden fetters. The New Deal was begun. ([Location 8069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8069))
- Capitalism was not going to lift itself out of the slump—it was stuck in the short-term present. Fear was so intense that the owners of capital favored the psychological return of security over seeking pecuniary profit—to wait it all out instead of investing. Many other people with money to spend joined them. Not just capitalists but ordinary Americans were running on banks and removing deposits, then putting the money perhaps under a mattress, if not in a hole dug in the ground. Due to fear, much economic activity simply ceased. ([Location 8084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8084))
- When FDR took the United States off the gold standard, prices began to climb. Expectations shifted, and economic spending returned. ([Location 8092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8092))
- Next, the New Deal attempted a dizzying variety of policy experiments. The overarching keyword that motivated them all was security. The primary goal was control: to de-volatize capitalism and to employ breadwinning men. ([Location 8093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8093))
- The New Deal’s regulatory arm transformed banking and finance, as well as the conduct of industry and agriculture. The politics of income now blossomed. Multiple programs lifted commodity prices and shored up farm incomes. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided new income security. The Wagner Act, of the same year, legally institutionalized union collective bargaining over pay. ([Location 8094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8094))
- They made public investments in the infrastructure of the still-dawning energy-intensive, auto-industrial economy, including dams, roads, and power utilities. Developmental policies offered inducements, but investment remained largely in private hands. With a strong regulatory arm and a weaker developmental one, the “liberalism” of the Democratic Party was born. ([Location 8099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8099))
- Meanwhile a new kind of liquidity preference appeared, in addition to the speculative and the precautionary motivated by economic-psychological considerations. Capitalists politicized liquidity preference. Decrying liberal regulations and taxation, the owners of capital once again pulled back their investments, demanding their desired economic policies. ([Location 8104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8104))
- It was not the New Deal but World War II—the subject of Chapter 14, “New World Hegemon”—that finally pulled the United States out of the Great Depression. The “total energy” of total war did the trick, even if the war economy was good only at producing bombs, tanks, and airplanes.

- By 1948, a rising anti-Communist ideology had set a hard left edge on Cold War–era liberalism. Wartime government controls on economic life were lifted. The owners of capital regained control over investment. The United States was the hegemon of the capitalist world economy. Postwar U.S. industrial society took shape.

- Liberalism was the moniker FDR adopted, in a departure from the classical or “laissez-faire” liberalism of the nineteenth century. Now Republicans became “conservatives.” At a moment when politics, across the globe, newly asserted control over economic life, FDR was the right mass democratic politician.

- Despite the dramatic post-1933 price reflation and economic recovery, the immediate problem of the 1930s was not so much the regulation of enterprise and the distribution of incomes. Rather, long-term economic development remained disrupted because so much capital remained on the sidelines. The dearth of investment meant a dearth of employment-giving enterprise to generate labor incomes in the first place. Developmental policies had two subsets as well: state-funded public corporations that placed capital and credit in private hands, and federal programs that made direct public investment outside any private channel.

- The maintenance of the gold standard had required that countries privilege an international obligation—to defend their currencies’ fixed exchange rate with gold—over any domestic economic priority. Defending the gold standard periodically required raising interest rates to recruit foreign gold, which restricted the supply of domestic credit and caused deflation.

- FDR appointed RFC board member Jesse H. Jones its new chairman. Jones hailed from Houston, a city Jones believed, rightly, was destined to become the “Chicago of the South.” After FDR, Jones was arguably the second most powerful man in the country during the 1930s. He was a banker, a Democratic Party operative, and an old Bryanite who believed Wall Street had monopolized capital and credit.

- Cohen was the brains behind the Securities Act of 1933, which began to chip away at the NYSE’s self-regulation, prohibiting deceitful securities issues. However, even as Wall Street fell under new regulations, laws such as this had the unintended consequence of further concentrating U.S. capital markets on Wall Street.

- More consequential than the Securities Act was the Banking Act of 1933, commonly named after its southern Democratic sponsors, Carter Glass of Virginia and Henry B. Steagall of Alabama.

- Glass-Steagall also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a public corporation like the RFC. Its aim was to prop up “unit” banking, or small country banks without branches.

Regulation Q created a… ([Location 8353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8353))
- The explicit regulatory goal was to slow capital down, to create walls and pockets, blocking and controlling the free convertibility of assets—in other words, to make the financial system less dependent on transactional liquidity and less vulnerable to leverage and volatility.39 The Glass-Steagall wall between investment and commercial banking was an instrument, and a symbol, of the effort.

- In the spirit of trying something, during the First Hundred Days, congressional legislation made quite dramatic interventions in commercial markets, to restrict supply and thereby reflate the economy. ([Location 8371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8371))
- On May 12, 1933, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, creating a new federal agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). Its stated goal was to reflate commodity prices and thus farm incomes. Another aim was debt relief. ([Location 8373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8373))
- In the highly competitive agricultural sector, farmers aspired to be price givers themselves, with guaranteed incomes above their cost of production—regardless of the intersection of supply and demand. This version of income politics required government intervention. ([Location 8379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8379))
- The “domestic allotment” programs of the AAA worked to restrict supply by paying farmers not to produce. The cost of production did not prevail politically. ([Location 8382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8382))
- By the time the AAA was created in the spring of 1933, most farmers had already planted their fields. In the South, tenants plowed up 10 million acres of cotton—for which landlords (not tenants) received checks for $100 million. ([Location 8386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8386))
- Infamously, Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace ordered the slaughter of millions of piglets and hundreds of thousands of sows. Milk was poured onto roadsides. But prices did rise. ([Location 8388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8388))
- 1934 the federal government restricted supply by paying farmers not to plant and sow in the first instance. By then, thousands of county-level production “control committees” existed in rural America to monitor production. If at times the methods were inelegant, restricting agricultural supply reflated prices and finally undermined deflationary expectations. Increased farm incomes also became a fresh source of consumer demand for manufactures and services, aiding recovery. ([Location 8390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8390))
- The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 would repeg the dollar to gold at $35 an ounce. The devaluation against gold since FDR’s inauguration was 60 percent. Rather than repegging it for all time, FDR announced that if need be, there would be more adjustment. “I reserve the right,” he declared, “to alter this proclamation as the interest of the United States may seem to require.” ([Location 8401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8401))
- The Farm Credit Administration absorbed Hoover’s Federal Farm Board and appropriated $200 million to refinance farm mortgages.

([Location 8405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8405))
- If prices rose above parity, farmers sold their crops, paid the loans, and pocketed the difference. If not, the CCC swallowed the loans and took possession of the crops. Only farmers who obeyed production controls received such supports. ([Location 8412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8412))
- The farm bloc was long the electoral backbone of the Democratic Party, and many New Dealers felt at home with agrarian policy. ([Location 8415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8415))
- “Back to the land” movements, tinged with nationalist, if not fascist nostalgia, were common across depressed industrialized economies.49 Not coincidentally, it was FDR who signed off on the construction of the Jefferson Memorial in 1934. ([Location 8415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8415))
- In March 1933, Congress created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), led by FDR’s former New York head of relief, Harry Hopkins. FERA set a precedent of funneling federal welfare funds through state governments, which did most of the administering. Municipal governments lost out. ([Location 8426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8426))
- Tellingly, rather than disbursing cash—charity, or the “dole” as FDR called it—FERA paid state governments to pay men wages for work, essentially simulating male breadwinning. ([Location 8428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8428))
- The final act of the First Hundred Days was the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933, which created the National Recovery Administration (NRA).53 The act aimed to raise prices, wages, and profits—if necessary, by restraining production through government-sanctioned monopolies. Monopolistic tendencies among firms would be welcomed, even embraced. ([Location 8433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8433))
- The NRA suspended antitrust law. The plan was that all the firms in every industrial sector would cooperatively agree on “industry codes”—binding agreements to limit production volumes, prices, and wages. The NRA was modeled after the short-lived War Industries Board of World War I, but government intervention of this kind outside wartime was unprecedented in U.S. history. ([Location 8440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8440))
- The NRA’s industry codes applied to labor standards. In a dramatic legal departure, Section 7(a) of the NIRA established the rights of industrial workers to “organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing”—at a time when unions represented only 5 percent of U.S. industrial workers. The NIRA also called for maximum hour and minimum wage standards. ([Location 8444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8444))
- In May 1933, Congress chartered a public corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to take over Henry Ford’s failed bid to develop the Tennessee River valley at an abandoned World War I munitions site near Muscle Shoals, Alabama. ([Location 8448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8448))
- The TVA would expand electric power generation to an impoverished rural region, which private power utilities had deemed unprofitable. ([Location 8451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8451))
- The other developmental agency was the Public Works Administration (PWA), created by Title 2 of the NIRA. FDR handed the PWA to Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, a Chicago political reformer. On the basis of a $1 billion bond issue, the PWA was granted authority to issue up to $3.6 billion in public investments in, essentially, infrastructure—“internal improvements,” to call back the Age of Commerce. ([Location 8453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8453))
- Far more dominant than public investment in the First Hundred Days was the adversarial regulation of banking and finance, the tackling of male unemployment through relief, and the effort to reflate prices by ending “overproduction” in agriculture and industry. ([Location 8458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8458))
- Cohen drafted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Publicly traded corporations now had to issue yearly and quarterly financial reports. The act banned “insider trading” and was full of antifraud provisions. To enforce the act, a new regulatory agency was created, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ([Location 8465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8465))
- In 1934 Congress also passed the National Housing Act, bringing about massive changes in the market for residential investment. If the SEC focused on regulation of securities trading, the National Housing Act’s goals were developmental—to use public authority to reduce uncertainty and induce profitable long-term investment in real estate construction. It succeeded. ([Location 8471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8471))
- The National Housing Act created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which pushed private residential investment onto a longer-term time horizon. Before, most private mortgages had had terms of three to five years, not amortized, with large “balloon” payments in the final year. The FHA standardized the terms of home improvement loans (Title I) and home mortgage loans (Title 2). It also extended amortized payment schedules, typically between twenty and thirty years. ([Location 8475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8475))
- Soon 1938 legislation would create the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or “Fannie Mae”) to sponsor a secondary national market in FHA-approved mortgages. The FHA also insured approved loans. Long-term real estate investment, if a tad boring, became nearly risk free, with guaranteed profits. ([Location 8478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8478))
- Government guaranteed transactional liquidity—a willing buyer—for bonds. In this case, the fusion of public authority and private initiative was fruitful. ([Location 8480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8480))

- May 1935 saw the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which FDR handed to Hopkins, of the now-superseded FERA. ([Location 8535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8535))
- The WPA became the largest New Deal agency, for which Congress appropriated nearly $5 billion. Individuals seeking employment could apply to a local WPA agency and take a means test. The WPA directly employed its beneficiaries. Employment was limited to one person per household, with overwhelming preference for able-bodied male breadwinners. Women made up roughly 15 percent of the WPA’s work rolls, as did African-Americans. ([Location 8536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8536))
- Approximately 75 percent of WPA employment was on the public infrastructure projects of “highways, streets, public buildings, airports, public utilities, and recreational facilities.” ([Location 8540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8540))
- The WPA was not “relief.” Rather than simply lessen as much human suffering as possible, or stimulate spending, government continued to focus on simulating the capitalist wage bargain. ([Location 8542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8542))
- As the president waffled politically, the U.S. Supreme Court acted. In May 1935 the Court handed down its decision in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, striking down NRA codes, ruling them unconstitutional delegations of legislative power.74 FDR could not believe the decision was 9–0. ([Location 8551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8551))
- He requested that four bills be passed: the Social Security Act; the National Labor Relations Act; the Banking Act; and the Public Utility Holding Company Act. A few days later, he added to the list a Revenue Act, including a new progressive income tax bill. This period became known as the “Second Hundred Days.” ([Location 8561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8561))
- The Jacksonian Democracy had supported a politics of property; “security” now became the new rallying cry, as income politics now moved to center stage, both in the New Deal and in the Democratic Party. ([Location 8563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8563))
- The new revenue tax targeted the top 1 percent of income earners, and the top tax rate climbed from 63 to 79 percent. (Until 1938, only John D. Rockefeller, Sr., was rich enough to pay it.) Only the top 5 percent saw their taxes raised. Estate taxes increased, and so did the progressive corporate income tax. ([Location 8567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8567))
- The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was perhaps the most direct assault against the owners of capital of any piece of New Deal legislation. It was another Frankfurter, Cohen, Corcoran job, working in alliance with southern Democrats, led by Texan Sam Rayburn in the House. When he was governor of New York, FDR had been an advocate of public electric utilities. ([Location 8581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8581))
- The preamble to the Public Utility Holding Company Act declared, “Public-utility holding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected with a national public interest.”85 The purpose of utilities was to provide a public service in return for a “reasonable” rate of return above cost and nothing more—a politicization of capital income. ([Location 8590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8590))
- Meanwhile, through its public investments, the TVA was beginning to generate public power, charging and publicizing a “yardstick” for electricity against which to measure the reasonableness of private rates and profits. ([Location 8595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8595))
- Despite the fact that women wage earners represented 25 percent of the U.S. workforce, the founding principle of Social Security was the male-breadwinner-female-homemaker ideal.88 Architects of Social Security, including Grace Abbott—although Labor Secretary Frances Perkins demurred—explicitly sought to salvage male breadwinning. ([Location 8605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8605))
- Social Security catered to industrial, male wage earners, working in large corporations where payroll taxes could be easily collected. The program excluded rural and domestic workers, many of whom were members of minority racial and ethnic groups. Initially, only 15 percent of all wage-earning black women were entitled to Social Security benefits. ([Location 8614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8614))
- The Banking Act of 1935 reformed the Federal Reserve System.91 It increased the powers of the system’s Washington-based board of governors. The board, its chairman, and its vice-chairman were now to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate and were independent of the regional banks. ([Location 8617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8617))
- Furthering the downgrading of the power of the New York Fed, five of the twelve regional bank presidents joined the governors on a rotating basis on the new Federal Open Market Committee, which enjoyed the power to set short-term interest rates in the money market and to determine member bank reserve requirements. The effect was to dilute the power of private bankers in monetary policy. ([Location 8620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8620))
- Finally, in the Second Hundred Days, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, otherwise known as the Wagner Act after its chief legislative sponsor, New York senator Robert F. Wagner. ([Location 8623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8623))
- When the Supreme Court killed the NRA and Section 7(a), FDR declared the Wagner Act “must” legislation. The act salvaged 7(a) and created a new administrative court, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB would enforce workers’ newfound rights in the workplace: to organize; to elect unions by majority votes certified by the NLRB; to have those unions recognized as their exclusive bargaining representatives over wages, hours, and working conditions; and to go on strike. ([Location 8625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8625))
- The Wagner Act further outlawed “unfair labor practices,” which barred employers from interfering with the exercise of workers’ bargaining rights. Finally, the NLRB would determine the appropriate “bargaining unit,” opening the possibility of industrial rather than AFL-style craft-based labor organizing. ([Location 8629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8629))
- The presidential election of 1936 was a historic landslide, securing the New Deal. FDR drubbed the Republican candidate, Alf Landon, winning every single state except Maine and Vermont. ([Location 8643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8643))
- The AFL’s Gompers-style “pure and simple” unionism had restrained itself from entering mass politics, but Lewis, though long a Republican, had no such misgivings. The CIO contributed somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of the Democratic Party’s 1936 expenditures.97 Organized labor’s seat at the table of New Deal liberalism was bought and paid for with money and votes. ([Location 8645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8645))
- A great theme of 1930s art, especially much of the public art sponsored by the WPA, was the dignity of human labor. Notably, the mural was designed for a Social Security Building. Social Security was premised upon wage earning—no “dole,” as FDR put ([Location 8658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8658))
- Arguably the greatest American work of art created during the 1930s was in this sprit: that was James Agee and Walker Evans’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1939), a blend of creative and empathic nonfiction that featured photographs of impoverished southern sharecroppers. ([Location 8667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8667))
- The Wagner Act had shifted the politics of pay in the direction of labor earnings. The workweek was reduced from forty-eight hours to forty, with time and a half for overtime. ([Location 8677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8677))
- But if there is one reason why, in the United States, a left-leaning liberalism emerged from the Great Depression as opposed to a right-wing populist, if not fascist, nationalism as in other polities (and the UAW’s union drive in Detroit took place near the home of the right-wing anti-Semite Father Charles Coughlin), it was because of the presence of a left-leaning organized labor in the New Deal’s winning political coalition—and not only its presence but its assertion. ([Location 8696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8696))
- The economic consequence of the New Deal was to advantage large-scale enterprise and to support high productivity, high male wages, and high-energy auto-industrial society.108 Further, New Deal policies reconfigured the relationship between the agricultural and industrial sectors, creating a long period of balance between them. ([Location 8706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8706))
- By 1936 many measures of economic activity—prices, production, and incomes—had recovered to 1929 levels. ([Location 8710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8710))
- The main early pivot of recovery was, rather, the devaluation of the currency upon the departure from the gold standard in 1933, which broke deflationary expectations and led to a recovery of spending of all kinds, including the most dynamic factor of investment. ([Location 8713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8713))
- Meanwhile, after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, as many feared a Nazi-induced inflation, much gold departed from Europe and fled into the U.S. banking system, which helped expand credit and raise prices. ([Location 8716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8716))
- By 1940, the United States possessed an astonishing 80 percent of world gold reserves. ([Location 8719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8719))
- the New Deal did little to help what became known as “small business” ride out the Depression. ([Location 8725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8725))
- Tellingly, employment in industrial “research and development” nearly tripled. Patent applications were up. In chemicals and plastics, new products, such as polyethylene (1935) and Teflon (1938), arrived. Productivity growth in manufacturing continued to surge, as it had during the 1920s. ([Location 8730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8730))
- That helps explain another 1930s trend: the persistence of male unemployment. The growth of white-collar jobs meant that many women entered white-collar employment. ([Location 8733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8733))
- Altogether the 1930s featured what is called today a “jobless recovery.” ([Location 8741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8741))
- During FDR’s first term, farm incomes increased 50 percent.120 New Deal policies also began to induce people to leave the land. Before, underemployment in the U.S. agricultural sector had acted as an economic drag, especially in the South, given the toxic marriage of sharecropping and white supremacy. Mechanization had failed to take command during the Age of Capital. At first, New Deal legislation remained locked in its “southern cage,” dependent on the votes of Jim Crow Democrats. ([Location 8749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8749))
- But after 1935, New Deal agricultural programs increasingly supported sharecroppers’ rights.122 The absolute number of farm tenants decreased by 25 percent between 1935 and 1940.123 Planters used federal credit subsidies to mechanize pre-harvest labor, then employ wage labor at harvest time. Together with national minimum wage decrees, the New Deal state finally began to undermine the regional separation of the South’s low-wage labor market from the higher-wage North—a blow to the economics of Jim Crow. ([Location 8753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8753))
- In favoring mechanization over agricultural labor, the New Deal also primed southern economic life for the mass black out-migration of World War ([Location 8758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8758))
- A large share of the economy-wide productivity gains during the 1930s have been attributed to the building of roads, tunnels, and bridges. Schools, post offices, train stations, and airports were also built. The “PWA Moderne” architectural style featured solid massing, evoking stability, and lines that swerved, as if they were electric.128 What had been called “internal improvements” in the Age of Commerce increased the national extent of markets, bringing about an Age of Control wave of Smithian economic growth. ([Location 8766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8766))
- The overwhelming bias toward spending on infrastructure of the more sparsely populated West created political support for the New Deal. “We shall tax and tax, spend and spend, and elect and elect,” intoned WPA head Harry Hopkins. ([Location 8771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8771))
- Jesse Jones’s RFC state capitalist empire offered cheap consumer loans for farmers, especially in the South, to buy electric appliances—say, General Electric refrigerators—and to thereby become consistent electric utility customers. ([Location 8775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8775))
- The PWA’s largest individual projects were the completion of the great western hydroelectric power dams, the largest concrete dams in the world—Bonneville, Shasta, and Grand Coulee. Congress had appropriated funds for the Hoover Dam in 1932. ([Location 8778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8778))
- In 1937–38 came a sharp economic downturn, the so-called “recession within the Depression,” particularly in the industrial sector. Many New Dealers finally began to make the correct diagnosis: the economic problem had been not overproduction but rather underinvestment and underconsumption. They began to consider using government deficit spending to kick-start private economic initiative through a fiscal multiplier. ([Location 8786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8786))
- However, by now a bitter enmity between many liberals and many industrial capitalists had broken out into the open. Industrial capitalists threatened not to invest unless their political demands were met, especially for lower taxation on their incomes. Precautionary liquidity preference, born of panic and fear at the beginning of the decade, had transformed by the decade’s end into a political weapon wielded by the New Deal’s capitalist critics.

- Organized through the National Association of Manufactures and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading bloc of U.S. capitalists blamed the lack of investor “confidence” on the “uncertainty” of government policy. The New Deal had brought security to farmers and wage earners only, apparently. ([Location 8831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8831))
- Lammot du Pont II sang capital’s grievances: Uncertainty rules the tax situation, the labor situation, the monetary situation, and practically every legal condition under which industry must operate. Are taxes to go higher, lower or stay where they are? We don’t know. Is labor to be union or non-union?…Are we to have inflation or deflation, more government spending or less?…Are new restrictions to be placed on capital, new limits on profits?…It is impossible to even guess at the answers. ([Location 8833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8833))
- To this day, the owners of capital level the same charges against government. Back then capitalists complained especially about the 1936 “undistributed profits tax,” which taxed profits that companies did not immediately invest or distribute through wages or dividends—a direct policy assault on the precautionary hoarding of corporate cash. ([Location 8843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8843))
- Corcoran, Cohen, and Frankfurter (in one year nominated by the president to sit on the Supreme Court) convinced FDR that no truce was possible. Concentrated economic power was responsible for the slump, against which the New Deal state must square off, in adversarial style. The federal government’s confrontational stance did little to induce investment. But this late New Deal impulse quickly translated into a lasting liberal politics of adversarial business regulation.

- They all, at some point, had argued that “underconsumption,” not “overproduction,” was the economic problem stunting development.

- In the late 1930s, it was needed. Capitalists themselves still suffered from disquietude and were falling down on the job of investment, hoarding out of precaution instead. Keynes proposed in The General Theory that a volume of investment sufficient to end mass unemployment would likely “prove impossible without a far-reaching change in the psychology of investment markets such as there is no reason to expect.” Keynes wrote, “I conclude that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.” The General Theory recommended “a somewhat comprehensive… ([Location 8888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8888))
- The General Theory had yet to make an impact as a book, but Keynes’s ideas were in circulation.149 And he clearly saw the political bind posed by his theory. He attributed the 1937–38 recession to a “peculiar kind of new crisis of confidence,” leading to the “failure of durable investment to develop.”150 In February 1938 he wrote to FDR, “You must either give more encouragement to business or take over more of their functions yourself.” If “public opinion” was not “yet ripe” for a greater role for public investment in, say, electric utilities, then “what is the object of chasing the utilities round the lot… ([Location 8895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8895))

- Ruml and Henderson estimated that the U.S. national income was $56 billion. That would be a prospective $32 billion, they approximated, short of the economic output necessary to bring employment up to full potential. Citing the concept of a multiplier, when targeting $32 billion, Ruml advocated government expenditure of somewhere between $7 billion and $10 billion in “additional investment or spending, public or private, to get reasonable full employment.” Ruml projected $4 billion in forthcoming private investment. Therefore he recommended to FDR a program of $3 billion in direct public investment—a new kind of jolt to economic development. ([Location 8910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8910))
- In April 1938 the president proposed to Congress a “new” federal expenditure of $1.5 billion for public works. It would raise the “national income” from $56 billion to $80 billion (the numbers kept shifting), which was necessary, FDR argued, to end the scourge of mass unemployment.154 Congress went along. But first it slashed the capital gains taxes and killed off the undistributed profits taxes. Government spending went up, and taxes went down—something of a truce. ([Location 8916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8916))
- Some historians have argued that the New Deal’s turn toward budget deficits in 1938 represented the “end of reform,” since New Deal liberalism became preoccupied with adjusting macroeconomic aggregates rather than transforming the core institutions of capitalism through political and legal interventions.155 The attempt to induce greater private investment by slashing taxes on the owners of capital—a core policy staple of New Deal liberalism over the decades, persisting to this day—confirms such an analysis.

- In September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, and the subject of FDR’s fireside chats became war in Europe. U.S. unemployment was still stuck in the double digits, as the New Deal had failed to achieve its great goal of reemploying white male breadwinners. Much more, it left open the question of employing them to do what exactly? Keynes believed increased government expenditure in the right dosage could end the slump (end all slumps). But he also drew a troubling conclusion: “It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiment which would prove my case—except in war conditions.” ([Location 8931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8931))
- What capitalism lacked was energy from a human source, the ability to pull people and resources back into the industrial economy and get the line moving again.

- Everywhere war energized mass popular expectations for long-term development and greater abundance. Afterward a generation of long-term private, illiquid investment in wealth-generating industrial production throughout the world would follow, settling down industrial society. Meanwhile, during World War II, fossil fuel industrialism further became entrenched. During the war, oil was a great strategic prize, after all. If it had not already begun, the Anthropocene, or the geological era of man-made climate change, now became fated.

- Prodigious public investments in newly constructed “government-owned, [private] contractor-operated” (GOCO) enterprises drove war production forward.8 The public allocation of capital induced private industry back to life. By the opening of 1943, in the Grand Alliance against the Axis powers, the Soviet Union was still doing most of the fighting, and the dying, by far, but the awesome potential of U.S. mass production began to be unleashed, and soon it would overwhelm its enemies.

- While economic historians debate whether World War II even constrained American civilian consumption, the United States built the first fighting force in the history of the world that was capable of strategically commanding two oceans.

- another total war was fought over nothing short of the very way that life should be lived. Stalin said victory brought not only the occupation of territory but also the right to declare a “social system.”10 U.S. capitalism held out one such vision of the good life, and behind it was the obliterating apocalyptic nuclear capacity of U.S. state power. At this point, the history of American capitalism inescapably becomes global history. ([Location 8998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=8998))
- During 1944, as the outcome of the war looked increasingly secure, planning began for peacetime. Battle lines had already begun to appear in preparation for the great postwar political struggle over the size and purpose of the New Deal state. The final political-economic settlement of the Age of Control, the mix of regulatory and developmental policies, waited for the war to end. But “big government” was here to stay.

- When Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, the United States had an army of 175,000 soldiers. That barely edged out Bulgaria for sixteenth place in the world. ([Location 9010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9010))
- Hitler’s Second Book (1928) noted that the United States had developed differently. Americans conquered the North American landmass, removing, by violence, a putatively racially inferior native population. Hitler compared eastern Europe’s Slavs to America’s “Red Indians.” He was sorry that the American Civil War destroyed “the beginnings of a great new social order based on the principle of slavery and inequality.” ([Location 9020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9020))
- The Spanish-American War (1898) was the largest U.S. land grab since the Mexican-American War (1846–48). The United States acquired overseas colonial possessions in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, and in 1898 it annexed Hawaii. In the Philippines, the U.S. troops waged a brutal racial war of occupation that lasted until 1902 and was responsible for no less than 200,000 Filipino deaths.16 In the Americas, U.S. troops landed in Nicaragua and Cuba. ([Location 9027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9027))
- Certain raw materials that the continental United States did not possess—bauxite, for instance, a mineralogical source of aluminum, a new construction material of the Machine Age, with large deposits in South America—were critical to new mass production industries. ([Location 9036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9036))
- At the 1933 Pan-American Conference in Uruguay, FDR’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, voted in favor of a resolution that “no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.” ([Location 9040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9040))
- The United States ended all occupations of Latin American and Caribbean countries by 1934—apart from a naval base in Guantánamo, Cuba, and a military base at the Panama Canal Zone. The Philippines Independence Act of 1934 held out Filipino independence after a ten-year transition period. Internally, New Deal legislation revived the possibility of federal acknowledgment of Indian sovereignties. ([Location 9041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9041))
- With an Open Door flavor, the 1934 Reciprocal Tariff announced U.S. commitment to trade liberalization throughout the world and granted the president the authority to negotiate bilateral trade agreements in order to slowly chip away at ever-tightening European imperial trading blocs. Further, many New Dealers supported national programs of economic “development,” which meant industrialization, throughout the world.21 In 1940, for instance, the United States provided capital, credit, and technical assistance to Brazil for the construction of its Volta Redonda steelworks. ([Location 9051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9051))
- Even as the Great Depression unraveled the peace, and Hitler plunged Europe into a gray zone of semi-war, a mass American social movement supported “neutrality.”22 In 1936, fully 95 percent of polled Americans said the United States should stay out of foreign wars. Congress passed three Neutrality Acts that embargoed U.S. sales of “arms, ammunition, or implements of war” to belligerents.23 The Neutrality Acts did not restrict U.S. arms sales to countries that were not at war. Through this channel, the U.S. war economy began to take shape. ([Location 9057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9057))
- The foreign buying spree began in the summer of 1938, after a group of British officials toured Lockheed Aircraft’s California facilities. By April 1940, Britain and France ordered nearly six thousand planes, injecting $573 million into fledgling firms such as Douglas, Lockheed, North… ([Location 9063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9063))
- After Great Britain and France declared war on Germany following its 1939 invasion of Poland, Congress revised the Neutrality Acts so that the United States could still export arms to the Allies. Over the objections of more isolationist… ([Location 9065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9065))
- The South balked at federal programs of public investment generally, for fear that the federal government might undermine the southern racial order. But it did support FDR’s May 1938 request for a $1.1 billion naval appropriation to expand the U.S. fleet by 20 percent. The 1938 Air Corps Expansion Act called for almost tripling the size of the U.S. fleet. Total U.S. military… ([Location 9068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9068))
- When the German blitzkrieg rolled out of the Ardennes forest in the spring of 1940, and France surrendered, Congress authorized $6.5 billion in military spending. FDR proclaimed that the United States would build the world’s first “two-ocean navy” and strive to produce what at the time seemed a staggering “50,000 planes a year.”25 U.S. rearmament was fully under way in… ([Location 9072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9072))
- In the last half of 1940 alone, the federal government invested $1.4 billion in fresh manufacturing construction (compared to $1 billion in private investment that year).27 The mechanism was public investment in what was called “… ([Location 9077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9077))
- The GOCO agreement guaranteed the reimbursement of all production costs as well as the allowance of a predetermined profit—“cost plus.” This became the GOCO norm. ([Location 9084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9084))
- Chrysler’s Detroit Tank Arsenal would go on to manufacture twenty thousand tanks, including the M3 “Grant” and M4 “Sherman” models. ([Location 9085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9085))
- As U.S. assembly lines were rolling, Britain began to buy war matériel for which it could not possibly pay. In December 1940, FDR announced that America “must be the great arsenal of democracy.” A Lend-Lease Bill passed Congress by large majorities. The United States would loan war matériel, food, and critical raw materials—especially oil—to Allies, who, in principle, would return it after the conclusion of hostilities (which they mostly did not). Between March 1941 and September 1946, the United States would expend $50 billion on Lend-Lease items.29 That alone was more than the $40 billion in total expenditures by New Deal agencies between 1933 and 1943. ([Location 9090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9090))
- Albert Kahn, Henry Ford’s old industrial architect, designed both Chrysler’s Detroit Tank Arsenal and Willow Run. ([Location 9100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9100))
- A great symbol of the American victory in World War II’s “Battle of the Factories,” Ford Motor Company’s Willow Run B-24 bomber production facility was said to be the largest one-roof factory in the world. On the production line, there was room enough for 110-foot winged airplanes to make full ninety-degree turns. ([Location 9104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9104))
- Bombers were made from aluminum—an industry that up until then had been dominated by one corporation, Alcoa. Refining aluminum takes twelve times as much energy as refining steel. DPC capital helped the Reynolds Metal Company develop facilities in both Alabama and Washington, near cheap sources of public hydropower. World War II would help launch both the airplane and the aluminum industries. ([Location 9108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9108))
- Japan eyed the resource-rich European colonial possessions in Southeast Asia, including British Burma and Malaya, French Indochina, and above all the oil-rich Dutch East Indies. ([Location 9114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9114))
- In the summer of 1941, Japanese forces moved south into Indochina. In response, the United States embargoed oil and froze all Japanese assets. Japan had imported most of its fuel from the United States, but now watched Lend-Lease American oil tankers cruise to the Soviet Union while its own supply diminished.

- the European theater, the epic Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942–February 1943), where combined military and civilian casualties ran around 2 million, was the decisive battle of the war. Compare the 419,000 U.S. wartime dead to the estimated 27 million Soviet. Only the grotesque final death throes of the Japanese and German regimes in 1944–45 matched the enormity of Soviet suffering. By contrast, in a February 1945 Gallup poll, almost two-thirds of U.S. civilians admitted they had not made “any real sacrifice for the war.” ([Location 9127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9127))
- pulling labor into the factories, wartime production ended mass unemployment, the greatest scourge of the Great Depression. Quickly, a new social expectation of government was born, that unemployment would never return. ([Location 9137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9137))
- After Pearl Harbor, the United States began its all-out industrial mobilization for war. 1942 was a year of construction; 1943, production; 1944, fighting. ([Location 9139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9139))
- Industrial production peaked in October 1943, at which time manufacturing, in value-added terms, reached its highest share in all of U.S. economic history. ([Location 9140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9140))
- the deliberations were new kinds of statistics. In the Commerce Department, a group led by Milton Gilbert, a former student of Simon Kuznets (who in the 1930s had developed the construct “national income”), developed the construct “gross national product” (GNP). GNP was a yearly measure of the income flow of total output, including war matériel. The Commerce Department first published a GNP figure in 1942. ([Location 9145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9145))
- The attitude was, let mass production rip.40 If FDR has asked for 60,000 planes in 1942, then over the course of the war, the United States would manufacture 300,000. ([Location 9152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9152))
- For Keynes’s The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), World War II would be a vindication. Between 1942 and 1945, net private investment was negative. Public investment however was $99.4 billion.41 A fiscal multiplier went to work, as public investment pulled unused resources and capacities off the sidelines, while adding, through new factory construction, a fresh source of demand from outside the economic system. Spending redounded, and economic activity brought increasing returns, with a cumulative effect. Economic output multiplied by a factor greater than public investment, and unemployment nearly disappeared. ([Location 9154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9154))
- The Northeast remained a significant home to shipbuilding, but the Midwest, more impervious to potential foreign attack, fared better. The largest new factory of the war would be the $175 million Chrysler-Dodge plant on the South Side of Chicago, to manufacture engines for Boeing B-29 bombers. ([Location 9169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9169))
- The plant’s main assembly room—this was Albert Kahn’s last industrial factory design—featured 3.5 million square feet of space, and the thirty thousand employees parked their cars in the world’s largest parking lot. (Today the plant is a shopping mall.) ([Location 9171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9171))
- appreciate the geographical transformation of U.S. economic life. For during World War II, a third, western industrialization took place, with far-reaching consequences.44 After the iron-, wood-, and textile-based industrialization of the Northeast during the Age of Commerce; and the steel-, coal-, and eventually mass production–based industrialization of the Northeast and Midwest in the Age of Capital; now, in the Age of Control, industrialization was based on aluminum, hydropower, and electronics. It took place in the South but above all in the Pacific West. ([Location 9176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9176))
- This time the driver was not a speculative investment boom, which was up to this point the most dynamic impulse of American capitalism. It was the federal government, which stamped one factory onto the ground after another. In but three short years, U.S. economic geography radically changed. ([Location 9181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9181))
- Henry Kaiser was a western New Deal entrepreneur who had joined with Warren Bechtel, founder of the privately owned (and still privately owned) San Francisco–based Bechtel construction company to become one of the six companies that built New Deal–era dams in the West. ([Location 9191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9191))
- After Pearl Harbor, Kaiser constructed “Liberty ships,” the Model T of the seas, in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, although his largest yard, funded with DPC capital, was in Richmond, California, north of his Oakland home. ([Location 9194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9194))
- “Pop” Kaiser joined the ranks of the great industrial paternalists. He paid high wages and welcomed black workers, women workers, and unions to Richmond. Paycheck deductions financed the Permanente Health Plan. The Richmond yards would build 20 percent of all Liberty ships, and Kaiser shipyards constructed 30 percent of all U.S. wartime ships, employing 200,000 workers. ([Location 9195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9195))
- FDR’s two-ocean navy was built. At the center of the wartime Pacific transformation, however, was the city of Los Angeles. At the beginning of the war, only 5 percent of the Los Angeles County labor force was in industry. The region was dominated instead by motion pictures, oil, and fruit canning. Soon the Pacific West manufactured nearly half of all U.S. warplanes, and the big-six aircraft manufacturers—Douglas, Lockheed, Vultee (called Consolidated after 1943), North American, Vega, and Northrop—located themselves along a corridor running near Los Angeles Airport that was built by the Works Progress Administration. ([Location 9199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9199))
- By 1944 no fewer than four thousand war factories were operating in Los Angeles, in all lines of industry. By 1945, Los Angeles County surpassed prewar Detroit in total value of war production (and in 1945 was second only to Detroit).51 The California population grew by 3.5 million persons between 1940 and 1950.52 California was now “the great world of the future.” ([Location 9204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9204))
- Pacific industrialization created demand for labor and coincided with the greatest moment of internal migration in U.S. history. Nationally, 57 percent of Americans changed residences, 21 percent crossing state lines—in addition to the 16 million mobilized by the military. ([Location 9209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9209))
- The largest migration was the 8 million Americans who moved west of the Mississippi. Los Angeles had been a “Jim Crow town,” but the great migration of more than one million blacks from the South finally began to undermine the regional segregation of southern labor markets from the rest of the country—a great economic blow to Jim Crow in the South. ([Location 9212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9212))
- Rapidly, the Pacific West ended any semblance of dependence on the East, whether for “Pittsburgh-plus”-priced steel ingots or Wall Street finance. Its leading industries, especially aerospace, were militarily funded but also technologically innovative. The war saw new innovations in electronics, computing, the mass production of penicillin, and jet propulsion. ([Location 9222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9222))
- The top secret Manhattan Project for building the atomic bomb was led by the University of California Berkeley physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. ([Location 9226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9226))
- The Axis powers fought a relatively labor-intensive war compared to the capital-goods-intensive U.S. variety. Hitler’s bloody drive for direct colonial control over eastern European raw materials and coerced, unskilled labor appeared ever more anachronistic as U.S. state capital financed one technologically innovative mass production industry after another from Seattle to San Diego. ([Location 9239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9239))
- The United States possessed vast internal reserves of necessary raw materials, including critical fossil fuels. During the war, it produced half the world’s coal and two-thirds of its oil. ([Location 9250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9250))
- Among the only necessary materials the United States ever was in danger of lacking was bauxite for aluminum, which it acquired from British colonial holdings, and copper, which it acquired from Chile. ([Location 9252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9252))
- By flipping the lights back on in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt, constructing a new industrial corridor in the Pacific West, and fashioning global supply chains, the Americans won the “war of the factories.” The pivotal year was 1942, when the United States produced $20 billion worth of munitions, compared to Germany’s $8.5 billion and Japan’s $3 billion. ([Location 9261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9261))
- It was World War II and not the New Deal that brought about the birth of American “big government.”73 Under the banner of a unitary national public interest, the federal government expanded prodigiously in sheer size and scope. ([Location 9294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9294))
- The question became what big government should do exactly, or not, given its new capacities as well as what was desirable politically. The struggle over the answer to this question began to emerge during the war, certainly by 1943. As public investment expanded, the hostility of many business elites to the New Deal did not diminish. They began to agitate politically for government to return investment back to the private owners of capital after the war. ([Location 9300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9300))
- Meanwhile New Deal income politics acquired momentum and took greater shape. Organized labor asserted itself. And as the total energy of World War II broke the back of the Depression’s mass psychological pessimism, wartime Americanism contributed to a new mass expectation of capitalism. ([Location 9303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9303))
- “Freedom,” the war’s great ideological rallying cry, must mean not only greater economic security but also abundance for all—including groups, such as women and blacks, excluded from the New Deal’s prime income benefits. ([Location 9305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9305))
- In the end, however, the war only solidified the New Deal’s commitment to shoring up white male breadwinning. ([Location 9306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9306))
- The film genre of “conversion narrative,” in which class animosity and racial and ethnic tensions gave way to patriotism, had many entrants. The best was Lifeboat (1944), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, using a screenplay written by Grapes of Wrath author John Steinbeck based on his novella, in which the characters struggle to unite, despite their differences, against a Nazi threat, while at the same time warding off their own instincts to submit to authoritarianism. ([Location 9317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9317))
- Congress’s First and Second War Powers Acts of 1941 and 1942 granted the executive a sweeping mandate to intervene in private American economic activity, of the likes not seen in North America since the Confederate States of America. ([Location 9322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9322))
- From price, wage, and profit controls, to high rates of income taxation, the extraordinary interventions taken by the federal government to restrain the price level and halt inflation are worthy of note—given their implications for the long-term fate of New Deal liberalism in the Age of Control. When the state held down interest rates on short- and long-term loans in order to induce private fixed investment, and issued debt to finance budget deficits and public investment, it pulled in untapped resources: labor, machines, and technological know-how. That led to the growth of total output and employment. But there were limits. Should there be no more resources left to draw from, should the “macroeconomy” reach its productive limit, monetary and fiscal expansion might lead to inflation—more money chasing a limited amount of goods. There is nothing wrong with inflation per se. ([Location 9365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9365))
- In 1943 inflation was held in check, yet cracks in the war-minded consensus broke out. Politically, conservative hostility to the New Deal reappeared. In the 1942 midterm elections, the Republican Party gained forty-seven seats in the House of Representatives and nine seats in the Senate. ([Location 9379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9379))
- the pro-business lobbies, the National Association of Manufactures (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, began to complain about government red tape and the assault on “private enterprise.”86 Government intervention, in their view, must not override the sphere of private economic activity. In particular, these lobbies sought to guarantee that after the war, responsibility for investment would be returned to private hands. In 1943, representing this faction, GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan asked NAM, “Is it not as essential to win the peace, in an economic sense, as it is to win the war, in a military sense?” Sloan warned of the ongoing “socialization of enterprise.” If that happened, “private industry is finished.”87 ([Location 9391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9391))
- At the outset of the war, labor had been calm. Leadership of both the AFL and the CIO had supported a “working-class Americanism” that patriotically submerged class conflict. Unions signed no-strike pledges. ([Location 9404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9404))
- Dramatically, in April 1941 the Ford Motor Company finally agreed to recognize the UAW. That year the CIO also organized Westinghouse, International Harvester, Goodyear, a number of West Coast aircraft manufacturers, and even a few southern textile companies. During the war, CIO membership climbed from 1.8 million to 3.9 million. In 1943 the CIO formed the first political action committee (PAC) to funnel donations to Democratic campaigns. By 1945, much because of the CIO’s expansion, 35 percent of U.S. nonagricultural workers were unionized. ([Location 9409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9409))
- despite blemishes, the CIO was by far the most racially integrated of the more important national institutions. The war economy opened up significant opportunities for black workers. In 1941 A. Philip Randolph, head of the all-black AFL auxiliary Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, visited FDR in the Oval Office and threatened a mass march on Washington. The president relented, issuing the executive order that “there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.” The federal government created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to investigate complaints, the origins of New Deal liberalism’s legal approach to handling workplace discrimination. By 1945, African-Americans accounted for 8 percent of war industry jobs, about the same percentage of the total population. ([Location 9421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9421))
- No executive order, however, prevented a number of spontaneous “hate strikes” against black workers in the summer of 1943. In Detroit, 25,000 Packard Motor Company workers went on strike when two black workers were promoted to nonmenial positions. ([Location 9427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9427))
- after World War II, by choice or not, most American women would leave the factories.97 By 1947, female labor force participation would slip back to 28 percent. The breadwinner-homemaker family ideal held strong during the war, as it had during the Great Depression. ([Location 9443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9443))
- In this context, the most consequential piece of social and economic legislation that Congress passed during the war was the June 1944 GI Bill.99 The legislation guaranteed World War II veterans a range of federal government entitlements, from a year of backstop unemployment insurance to residential mortgage assistance, education subsidies, and business loans. Economic entitlements thus flowed through male citizenship, explicitly defined by the GI Bill as heterosexual citizenship.

- The principle that male pay was the chief currency of distributive justice was by now deeply rooted in the political economy of the Age of Control. In this respect, the war economy did what the New Deal did not do: in creating 11.25 million new jobs, it ended mass male unemployment.

- In his final, January 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for an ambitious “Second Bill of Rights,” of economic rights, guaranteeing jobs, housing, medical care, education, and living wages. All these rights, FDR noted—hitting the central New Deal keyword—spelled “security.” But in an increasingly conservative Congress, FDR’s request fell on deaf ears. The Second Bill of Rights dropped like a dud. The narrower GI Bill passed instead. ([Location 9452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=9452))
- Investment was no longer insufficient in volume (as it had been during the Depression), but its wartime content—bombs, tanks, and guns—would require peacetime conversion.

- The urgency to employ male breadwinners would dominate the dramatic postwar hinge, when the political economy of New Deal liberalism finally settled in place. The issue would be inseparable from the question of on what terms and by what principles the federal government would attempt to rebuild the war-torn world economy, given both the blunt power of U.S. economic and military might and the hegemonic aspirations of a triumphant cultural Americanism abroad.

- Global domination of this order had not existed before. In 1945 the United States possessed roughly 70 percent of all gold reserves and half the entire world’s manufacturing capacity. It had, by far, the largest food stores in the winter of 1945–46, when many populations around the world suffered from hunger, if not starvation. At the war’s close, Americans owned three-quarters of all invested capital in the world, and the U.S. economy accounted for nearly 35 percent of world GDP—tripling its nearest rival, the Soviet Union.

- By inclination, many New Dealers were hostile to Wall Street. Further, at Bretton Woods, delegates from Latin American, Asian, and African countries hoping to industrialize their national economies gravitated toward a vision of the postwar world economy that favored long-term investment in production, even at the expense of globe-spanning private capital mobility.

- The final Bretton Woods agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold at the convertible exchange rate of $35 to the ounce. This peg was never supposed to budge. In turn, other national currencies would be pegged to the U.S. dollar, at freely convertible rates with it and one another. At the same time, the competitive devaluation of currencies—a strategic cheapening, to gain a trade advantage—was forbidden. However, according to the Bretton Woods agreements, currencies could be revalued in light of extreme international trade imbalances or reasonable national economic needs. State capital controls could prevent cross-border speculation on interest rate differentials and potential currency valuations. Altogether it meant scope for national monetary and fiscal policy.

- The Bretton Woods agreements called for the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to manage potential trade imbalances. Member countries would pay, in capital “subscriptions” of gold or U.S. dollars, into the $8.8 billion fund based on “quotas,” given their relative economic might. By far, the United States had the largest quota and the most power at the fund. If member countries had difficulty managing their international payments, the IMF had the discretion to grant them loans in order to provide their currency exchange rate with “stability.”16 The IMF was also granted discretionary authority to enforce the Bretton Woods agreements, which were to go into effect in December 1945.

- Before he died, FDR had expressed very little interest in carrying public ownership of GOCO (“government-owned, contractor-operated”) factories into peacetime. In preparation for the “conversion” of the war economy, he put the financier and pro-business New Dealer Bernard Baruch in charge of planning.

- Age of Capital witnessed the rise of standardized consumer products and, through national mail ordering, the creation of national “consumption communities.”6 By the turn of the twentieth century, cities had downtown department stores, like John A. Wanamaker’s and R. H. Macy’s, movie palaces, and many other forms of urban leisure and “cheap amusements.”7 Corporate advertising had been a billion-dollar industry during World War I, and it exploded during the Fordist consumer durables boom of the 1920s, when company and store installment credit began to proliferate.8 That decade the city of Los Angeles practically invented automobile suburbia.9 Even during the hardships of the Depression and war, many working-class and ethnic communities—Mexicans in Los Angeles, Poles in Chicago, Jews in New York—encountered mass consumer culture.10 Aided by the new mass communication of radio, a national consuming culture was forming.

- First, mass consumption became a truly national phenomenon, as television, the “selling machine in every room,” slowly replaced radio as the dominant medium of communication.11 By 1960, the so-called average American watched twenty-five hours of television per week.12 It was no longer possible to escape a national, homogenizing mass consumer culture—especially as immigration dramatically slowed down in the decades after the Immigration Act of 1924.

- But postwar America opened up a new frontier, so to speak, in the commodification of politics, as civic identity became entangled with consumption in ways that it had not been before. “Abundance” became an entitlement of economic citizenship.16 The line between citizen and customer, rights and gratifications, blurred. Even democratic politics increasingly became yet another form of consumer entertainment, although that did not necessarily mean citizenship became less dignified.

- That blacks “couldn’t even get a hamburger and a Coke at a soda fountain” became one of the political indignities of racial oppression, as the civil rights leader John Lewis once put it.17 The civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s had long roots in past labor organizing on the side of production. But that the movement made significant breakthroughs in venues of consumption, through boycotts and sit-ins, was no coincidence, reflecting just how charged consumption had become with political meaning.

- Cold War liberalism, of course, left capital investment to the capitalists. But U.S. income politics redistributed earnings away from the top and toward the middle of the income distribution. As the less wealthy are more likely to immediately spend, that increased the aggregate volume of consumption—a strategic factor in the maintenance of national income growth.

- In The General Theory, Keynes had assumed that for psychological reasons, personal consumption was a rather stable aggregate, even when personal incomes grew; investment, he thought, was more dynamic. Perhaps Keynes was wrong, many American Keynesians began to think. Not investment but private consumption could both drive and stabilize growth. In part, postwar consumerism was new because of its newly anointed “macroeconomic” significance. ([Location 10041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=10041))
- As one French critic of American consumerism would say, “Whatever happens, and whatever one thinks of the arrogance of the dollar or the multinationals, it is this culture which, the world over, fascinates those very people who suffer most at its hands, and it does so through the deep, insane conviction that it has made all their dreams come true.”22 American consumerism was a utopian project no less audacious than Soviet Communism.

- For consumption to drive long-term economic growth, in the absence of expanding long-term investment, in the short term consumers must always desire more, even as they learn that the final satiation of consumer desire is not possible. In the postwar period, it was a new long-term way of life, a new structure at once economic and psychological. As consumerism became culturally hegemonic, the short-time mindset of consumerism might even bleed into the investment function—undermining long-term investment, compelling even more consumption to sustain the macroeconomy.

- Capitalism demands an orientation of economic life toward the future, and so the constant urge to look back, and nostalgically stamp past ages “golden,” is probably some kind of psychic compensation for the unremittingness of that demand, especially in moments when, to many, it feels difficult to muster a positive vision about the future.

- Surely what explains much of the backward-looking fondness is that postwar industrial society had what early twenty-first-century economic life lacks, which is structure. The postwar era was one of containment, borders, and walls. Income inequality was “compressed.”1 Nuclear families contained husbands, wives, and children.2 When world trade revived, state controls restrained cross-border speculative capital investment. Immigration was limited. The high modernist straight line ruled in the International Style of corporate architecture. ([Location 10509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=10509))
- In postwar social thought, structure, a term with physical connotations, was a broad metaphor for social stability.6 Quite literally, however, much of the structure of mass industrial society resulted from the physical structure and mass of long-term investment in illiquid, productive capital—the plant, machines, and walls of the factories, within which labor and production yielded pecuniary incomes. Men marched off to work, passing through factory gates, to return home to nuclear families and live in the many postwar communities that formed around the factories. This was “social structure.” ([Location 10522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=10522))
- In the postwar political economy, corporate managers’ long-term investment in industrial capital anchored what could be called a “fiscal triangle.”7 The fiscal triangle—the federal government, for-profit corporations, and nonprofit corporations; big government, big business, and big philanthropy—was the dominant political-economic coordinating mechanism of Cold War liberalism.

- During the so-called golden age of capitalism, big government, for all its power at home and abroad—and it did sit on a nuclear arsenal capable of ending all civilization—nonetheless enjoyed a rather weak mandate to act in the name of the public interest when moving outside the orbits of either national security (Vietnam even threatened that) or shoring up the incomes of white male breadwinners.

- More than a century old, the long industrial epoch of American capitalism came to a close during the 1970s. Actually, the share of total U.S. employment in manufacturing peaked during World War II at 38 percent, at which time there were already more employees in the “service-providing industries.” After the war, in raw totals, service employment expanded while manufacturing held steady, but during the 1970s evidence abounded of a structural shift.

- After 1973, not just industrial employment but industrial productivity, profits, and wages, by various measurements, all sagged. Manufacturing would hardly disappear—roughly, it would retain its share of “value added” (the amount of value added to goods during the relevant stage of production) to the economy. However, as opposed to the era of industrialization, from this period forward in U.S. history, the recomposition rather than the expansion of manufacturing better captures the process at hand.2 Meanwhile the 1970s crisis of industrial capital was broader than anything captured in any economic statistic. Across all industrial societies, the decade saw one crisis of legitimacy after another—economic but also social, cultural, environmental, and political. ([Location 11070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11070))
- For generations, the productive capital of factories had anchored the generation of profits, pay, and fiscal revenue, as it had also anchored communities and families, inner lives and identities. In the 1970s, that base failed. ([Location 11077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11077))
- The many fault lines of the Age of Control set off a series of shocks—a very 1970s term, when there was “future shock,” the “Nixon shock,” “oil shocks,” and finally the “Volcker Shock” in monetary policy—that brought the decade to an end. The total transformation would be tectonic. ([Location 11083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11083))
- Given the total nature of the crisis of industrial capital, we might plausibly chart a number of pathways into discussing it. Economically, the sequence was clear. First came a profit squeeze. Between 1965 and 1970, despite macroeconomic expansion, the net corporate profit rate dropped from 16 percent to under 10 percent, and U.S. manufacturers, many suffering under international trade competition, saw their profits cut in half.6 The profit rate remained low throughout the 1970s relative to the postwar standard. However, as if from habit, on average, industrial corporate managers kept investing and producing. It became a decade of profitless prosperity, with high rates of corporate investment and production but flagging profits. ([Location 11092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11092))
- In 1971, for the first time in the twentieth century, the United States ran a trade deficit in goods with the world. ([Location 11099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11099))
- After decades of world economic recovery and growth, the dollar was now overvalued relative to other currencies. That hurt U.S. manufacturers at home and abroad. With them in mind, in 1973 President Richard Nixon’s administration broke the dollar-gold peg. The Bretton Woods international monetary system was over. Soon the United States lifted all cross-border capital controls. Now the value of the dollar would be determined in global currency trading markets—subject to the momentary whims of trade and speculative expectations. ([Location 11102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11102))
- In 1973 came the first global “oil shock,” as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of the fossil fuel, the most crucial of all industrial inputs. ([Location 11112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11112))
- bad harvests in the Soviet Union and China had led to the exhaustion of government stockpiles of grains. Inventories could not adjust, so prices did. Interacting with speculative expectations in the post–Bretton Woods currency markets, commodity prices surged. Commodity price inflation broke out. The cost of primary inputs increased. Immediately, the U.S. rate of productivity growth was bumped onto a lower track.8 It would never recover.9 Given the immediate shock, economic production declined. In 1973 the United States entered into the deepest recession since the Great Depression—except now in the midst of price inflation, rather than deflation, as was the case in the 1930s. ([Location 11114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11114))
- The federal government rolled out the standard corrective measures, all fashioned since the 1930s. Government welfare payments—more than doubling between 1970 and 1975, nearly equaling military expenditures—stabilized incomes and thus spending. In 1975, in countercyclical fashion, the federal budget entered a deficit. ([Location 11124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11124))
- Congress passed tax rebates to induce private investment. Altogether the macroeconomy climbed out of recession by the end of 1975 and began an expansion that would last until 1980, making it the second longest of the postwar period. ([Location 11126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11126))
- U.S. political economy still funneled income and welfare entitlements largely through the white-male-breadwinning wage. Without high rates of male employment and pay, there would be trouble. Average male pay flatlined after 1972. Troublingly, it delinked from the growth, however meager, of productivity, with which it had roughly correlated since World War II. Meanwhile the male workforce participation rate declined steadily. ([Location 11132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11132))
- the male-breadwinner-female-homemaker family entered crisis, too.10 In 1973 the divorce rate hit 50 percent. ([Location 11135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11135))
- Male identity crisis became a, if not the, great theme of popular cultural expression. ([Location 11144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11144))
- Meanwhile, as productivity and profits declined in industry, a distributional conflict between capital and labor, over the division of the spoils from an economic pie expanding at a lesser rate, was inevitable. ([Location 11158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11158))
- Finally, that productivity slowdown was exacerbated by the prodigious growth of the relatively low-productivity service sector: the new economy of eating and drinking places, which dominated the decade’s fastest-growing urban areas, which were in the Sunbelt. ([Location 11160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11160))
- But persistent, volatile, and high inflation may destabilize expectations and, by creating uncertainty, pull economies into the short-term present. That undermines long-term development. ([Location 11164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11164))
- There was no notion of a unified public interest on the basis of which to act anyway. Instead, the polity was splintering into Nixon’s Silent Majority, black nationalists, “back to the land” farmers, white ethnic revivalists (including neo-Confederates), Friends of the Earth, pro-life evangelical “family values” Christians, radical lesbians, international bankers, advocates of Indian sovereignties, Business Roundtable CEOs, black women activists of the National Welfare Rights Organization, white nationalist Vietnam veterans, and last but not least, individual practitioners of narcissism. ([Location 11173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11173))
- Already during this crisis decade, a new capitalism was being born. Leaving fixed structures on the ground, capital was becoming ever more roving, convertible, and global. New economic ways of life were appearing, especially in the Sunbelt. ([Location 11190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11190))
- Postwar industrial society had had its virtues—structure, stability, and the channeling of income growth to the middle of the distribution. Yet premised as it was on the white male heterosexual breadwinning wage, on social conformism, on an energy regime capable of threatening the planet’s future, and on dangerous, at times stultifying factory work, regret over its death was and is unwarranted. After all, Matta-Clark made his sculptural “cuts” at industrial and suburban structures in order to let in the light. ([Location 11192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11192))
- Nixon’s message to the world was clear. The United States would prioritize domestic concerns over international obligations. Thus the “Nixon Shock” of 1971, or the “new economic policy” as Nixon called it. Nixon’s Treasury secretary was the Democrat John Connally, a former governor of Texas and a nationalist who believed, “The foreigners are out to screw us. It’s our job to screw them first.” Both men deeply desired to restore U.S. manufacturing’s international prowess, which Nixon believed was the basis of postwar U.S. geopolitical power.24 As for domestic politics, “we’ll take inflation if necessary,” Nixon said, but “we can’t take unemployment.” ([Location 11235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11235))
- This spoke to the president’s electoral dream of a “new majority”—his populist appeal to white blue-collar workers, in an effort to divide and conquer the old New Deal liberal political coalition. The idea was to drive a wedge between blue-collar whites and the New Left, which AFL-CIO political director Al Barkan described as “kids, kooks, Communists, and other far-out ‘kinky’ left-liberals.” The way to do this was to ignite the already existing tensions among liberalism’s disparate interest groups. Always blunt, Nixon remarked, “we need to build our own new coalition based on Silent Majority, blue-collar Catholics, Poles, Italians, Irish. No promise with Jews and Negroes.”29 In practice, the president’s political strategy was far more sophisticated. ([Location 11254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11254))
- The new “rights conscious” social regulation took consumerist, middle-class abundance for granted. It had nothing much to say about the dollar crisis, corporate investment and disinvestment at home or abroad, or inflation. Emboldened, liberalism’s regulatory arm had by now completely lost touch with its enfeebled developmental arm. As for social regulation, however laudatory it was, it cut further into the already declining U.S. corporate profit rate. Lower profits threatened lower wages for blue-collar workers. ([Location 11272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11272))
- Friedman was by far the most ideological member of the influential Chicago school of economics, but he was not the only one. Of his generation, George Stigler worked on regulation, attacking the liberal ideas of “public utility” and “natural monopoly.”108 The Law and Economics movement was born in Chicago. Its most influential (if often misinterpreted) member, the British economist Ronald Coase, arrived at the University of Chicago Law School in 1964. Emblematically, Law School faculty member Richard Posner’s Economic Analysis of Law (1973) argued that the “economist’s idea of efficiency” was a ready proxy for “justice.” ([Location 11705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11705))
- Law School professor Robert H. Bork argued that the “only goal that should guide interpretation of the antitrust laws is the welfare of consumers,” which was best served by the efficient market allocation of goods free of government regulation. Low consumer prices, not general market structure or barriers to entry in enterprise, were the only proper standards for the application of antitrust laws. Besides, market competition would always blow down any barrier to entry worth blowing down. ([Location 11710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11710))
- The Chicago school produced a body of economic thought of great formal complexity and mathematical rigor. Politically, however, the upshot was often simple. In the abstract, markets were efficient and just—which just happened to agree with what the CEOs of the Business Roundtable already knew in their guts rather than from any mathematical model. ([Location 11730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11730))
- how simplifying and soothing it was, to assume in one’s economic model that individual knowledge of the future was perfectly rational and certain, a mere set of mathematical probabilities, when in reality everything was becoming so uncertain, because long-term industrial structures were evaporating. Institutions could be shunted to the side. Whatever they might be, Lucas recommended invariable policy “rules,” immune both from democratic politics and from presidential economic advisers.118 Then everyone could step back, politicians and their congressional staffers, too, and watch markets harmonize the macroeconomy. ([Location 11737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11737))
- State interventions would only be self-defeating anyway, as individuals took them into account, being rational agents. There was nothing in the world except individual choice and the logical precision of mathematical rigor. With its emphasis on stripped-down individual choice, the economic thought of the 1970s, later branded “neoliberal ideology,” was really just “Me Decade” economics. ([Location 11742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11742))
- In policy making, one cannot give Chicago school economists that much credit, however.120 Not Friedman but council chairman Schultze’s The Public Use of Private Interest had said that markets “not only minimize the need for coercion as a means of organizing society; they also reduce the need for compassion, patriotism, brotherly love, and cultural solidarity as motivating forces behind social improvement.”121 Let the market discipline when democratic politics could not. Let the market do what the state should not. ([Location 11746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11746))
- The deregulatory National Gas Policy Act of 1978 was, at first, a success. But the drift now was not to write better market regulations: even among liberals, it was to throw in the towel on market regulation altogether. When Carter sent trucking deregulation legislation to Congress in 1979, he promoted “increasing reliance upon the competitive marketplace.” He signed an executive order mandating that all federal agencies cease to “impose unnecessary burdens on the economy, individuals, public or private organizations, or State and local governments.” ([Location 11758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11758))
- Carter’s attention to the global scale was the reason the only novel macroeconomic initiative of his presidency played out there—in a coordinated attempt of states at “International Keynesianism.” Foiling it was another transnational constraint on national sovereignty: not human rights but short-term speculative movements of liquid global capital. ([Location 11776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11776))
- The locomotive strategy was that the United States, West Germany, and Japan would stimulate their national economies. Their combined demand then would stimulate the weaker economies, which would focus on holding down prices and becoming more competitive, to sell in the American, West German, and Japanese markets.

- the decade, in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. OPEC, concerned about the declining dollar, as global oil sales were denominated in dollars, was raising oil prices anyway, but oil prices doubled in 1979, accelerating the existing inflationary macroeconomic dynamic to politically disastrous heights. Having pledged to reduce oil subsidies, the Carter administration had no effective strategy besides voluntary wage and price guidelines, which were brazenly ignored.128 The oil shock dominated the headlines. Americans lined up at gas stations, and there was the occasional riot.129 ([Location 11790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11790))
- In ending Bretton Woods, Nixon had sought a shortcut toward restoring the postwar moment of U.S. hegemony. Instead, the result was a regression to an even earlier moment, which had seemingly ended with the Great Depression. Global liquidity preference, and international capital mobility, once again acted as constraints on national economic policy making. The locomotive strategy could not even go into effect before capital fled the dollar, which plummeted. Carter blinked: he announced a new policy of budget balancing, fiscal restraint, and monetary tightening. He brought the G7 along with him. ([Location 11803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11803))
- When the G7 met in Tokyo in May 1979, the communiqué promised “tight monetary measures and tight and prudent fiscal measures.” The Tokyo G7 communiqué declared that tackling inflation was the “immediate top priority.”131 For the first time since the early 1930s, austerity was back in economic policy making. ([Location 11807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11807))

- Carter asked Lasch what he should do. “I don’t know,” the historian said, true to his calling. At Camp David, Vice President Walter Mondale nearly suffered a nervous breakdown. Carter scribbled notes to himself: “The Great Society days are over. The problems of the nation can’t be solved with massive spending programs, public works, et cetera.” ([Location 11815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11815))
- The overhang of Vietnam surely explains why the federal government’s crisis of legitimacy during the 1970s was so severe.134 But the 1970s “energy crisis” had many manifestations. The oil shocks made that crucial input more expensive and contributed to a productivity slowdown in the most energy-intensive industries, all of them together triggering inflation. At the same time, as the sun set on industrial society, Carter sensed a broader enervation of the polity that undermined long-term expectations and stuck the U.S. economy into the inflationary present. ([Location 11823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11823))
- Volcker turned to Milton Friedman’s monetarist policies, which produced the final shock of the decade, the “Volcker Shock.” Up till then, normal practice for the Fed had been to target an interest rate in the short-term money market, which indirectly loosened or tightened the money supply. But now Volcker would attempt to use the Fed’s powers to directly target the growth of the quantity of money. He would leave interest rates alone, to set themselves freely in the market. Volcker was not a monetarist, but he liked the optics of it, saying, “More focus on the money supply also would be a way of telling the public that we meant business.”136 At the same time, the Carter administration also mandated credit controls. Altogether interest rates spiked, above 17 percent in April 1980. ([Location 11835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11835))
- Dramatically, the Fed had reasserted the scarcity value of money capital. The high interest rates that resulted from monetarist policy recruited short-term capital into the United States and halted the dollar’s decline. Meanwhile the reduced money supply and high cost of credit finally assaulted inflation and inflationary expectations. No less significantly, left to the markets, interest rates began to experience extreme volatility. Volcker had attacked inflation but had also exacerbated uncertainty. The predictable consequence of all this was to halt all kinds of spending. In the second quarter of 1980, GDP contracted by 7.9 percent. ([Location 11841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11841))
- Liberalism had been born in the 1930s, in a moment of economic crisis, when FDR wrested control over the dollar, at a time when nation-states, through capital controls and trade protection, were erecting walls around their national economies so as to better control them. The 1970s crisis of industrial capital, which was a crisis for liberalism, too, ended very differently. Walls would come down. Global interdependence would increase. Trade in goods and services would accelerate, as would cross-border movements of liquid, undecided capital in its primal money form. The Age of Control was over, and the stage was set for a new age of American capitalism. ([Location 11848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11848))
- a difficulty in characterizing, let alone naming, this new capitalism is one of its distinctive features. Perhaps it is “postindustrial” or “post-Fordist,” but those labels say what it is not, as opposed to what it is. Is it a “Second Gilded Age,” or a period of “neoliberalism,” in some sense a mere repetition of the late nineteenth century? Surely aspects of this capitalism, like its pattern of inequality and its dependence on debt, resonate with past eras. ([Location 11858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11858))
- What most distinguishes the Age of Chaos is a shift in what has always been capitalism’s core dynamic: the logic of investment, as it works through production, exchange, and consumption. Since 1980, a preference for liquidity over long-term commitment has dominated capital investment as never before. Fast-moving money, rapid investment and disinvestment, across various asset classes, as well as in and out of various companies, has not only overturned old methods of production—its logic has often threatened to overwhelm other economic patterns. In short, the liquidity of capital has made for a chaotic age dominated by the vagaries of appreciating assets.

- During the years 1979–82, to attack inflation, without being able to resort to any metal standard, given the 1973 monetary departure from gold, the Federal Reserve under the new chairmanship of Paul Volcker rolled out the weapon of the high interest rate. Double-digit interest rates and the sharp double-dip recession that followed the tightening of credit during the “Volcker Shock” finally mastered inflation. The Fed thus ascended to a preeminence in global economic policy making that lasts to this day.

- After his inauguration in 1980, Reagan left Volcker alone. His administration, ideologues chiefly, celebrated “the magic of the marketplace,” lambasted “big government” regulations, and decried black “welfare dependency.” In general, their policies were friendly to the owners of wealth. Important “deregulations” did occur.

- The Volcker Shock transformed the character of capital investment at home and abroad. In the world economy, high U.S. interest rates brought about a worldwide credit crunch and worldwide economic depression. Seeking high interest rates, global capital moved into the U.S. capital market in prodigious amounts. The value of the dollar soared. Accordingly, the U.S. trade deficit expanded. This new pattern would ultimately stick. It was an utter reconfiguration of U.S. global economic hegemony.

- Just as in the 1920s, there was a great speculative investment boom during the 1980s.

- Unlike the 1920s, which saw the birth of industrial Fordism, the 1980s speculative boom did not lead to a great surge of investment in productive activity. Rather, using new access to capital and credit through “leveraged buyouts,” financiers blew up the postwar industrial corporation and dethroned the postwar managerial class. There was a purge of fixed capital stock, especially in the historic northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt. Male manufacturing employment, and unions, suffered devastating blows from corporate disinvestments.

- Capital was more roving, and so the new capitalism became chaotic.

Following these investments, incomes, whether… ([Location 11898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11898))
- In the Age of Chaos, of course, there was still labor, production, and wealth-generating enterprise. But a different logic of valuation took precedence. The generation of incomes shifted away from the depreciation of a capital asset through its use and toward its price appreciation. What did that mean? Regardless of whether a corporate stock was connected to a wealth-generating or profit-making enterprise, its value might still go up. Or the value of another asset class—such as bonds, or real estate, or synthetic “financial derivatives,” an asset class newly created for the purpose—went up. The… ([Location 11902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11902))
- Income growth thus shifted from labor to the owners of property, or those who owned the appreciating assets. Accordingly, income inequality increased. The incomes of the owners of capital and labor incomes related to capital asset price appreciation in the “financial” and “business” services soared. That created fresh employment demand, in the places where the best-off lived, for jobs in the low-wage and historically feminized and racialized occupations of the service sector—in, say, food preparation or home health care.

- Asset appreciation depended on what Reagan called “the magic of the marketplace.” Speculation on short-term asset price run-ups depended on the presence of transactional liquidity—that there would always be a willing buyer in the upswing.

- A historically low short-term interest rate from the Fed supported a genuine worldwide economic boom, centered on the rise of China as a world manufacturing power after its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Regions of China became ever more linked to U.S. multinational supply chains, as Chinese producers exported such things as flat-screen televisions and, beginning in 2007, Apple’s iPhone, into the great U.S. consumer market. To help finance U.S. consumption and to accumulate dollar-denominated assets—the world’s safest, most risk-free, liquid investment—China also began to export prodigious amounts of its savings into the U.S. capital market. That helped hold down long-term interest rates as well. ([Location 11945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11945))
- Bernanke was correct that in addition to price stability and low inflation, the 2000s expansion shared many qualities with those since 1982. What he did not emphasize was that the pattern of economic development continued to be asset-led and therefore new income gains flowed largely to the best-off, who by now increasingly tended to be highly educated, and lived in those cities where the new economy thrived. In those places where it did not, economic life suffered. ([Location 11952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=11952))
- Led by Google, a number of IT companies found ways to make actual business profits by creating a new class of synthetic capital assets.

- In 2003 President George W.

- Just because a market advocate such as Friedrich Hayek or Milton Friedman once said something about the market does not mean that when Reagan became president, something in particular came to pass. In reactive mode after Reagan’s election, much of the intellectual left fell prey to assuming it did, hauling out a neo-Victorian, romantic critique of the corrosively greedy “market.”4 But to debate the appropriate moral limits of the market—a salutary debate, to be sure—is not to say all that much about how and why capitalist enterprise since Reagan has changed. ([Location 12005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12005))
- Reagan’s election did help augur in a new age of capitalism, but the transformation cannot be easily attributed to the conscious intentions of his administration, as it rolled into office. ([Location 12015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12015))
- On the campaign trail, Reagan and his advisers predicted that letting the market decide (whatever that meant) would lead to a surge in private savings, fixed investment, productivity growth, and profits. Altogether the combined result would be a national revival in manufacturing employment and output, and also in manufacturing exports, which would reverse the U.S. trade deficit. Reduced federal spending, especially on welfare, would lead to a balanced federal budget and a lower national debt.

- The day after Reagan’s inauguration, stock prices at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) began to climb. Against surprisingly little resistance from Democrats, Reagan was able to push through much if not all of his agenda. Basically, what happened next was that none of what Reagan had promised came to pass. Reagan delivered on but one economic campaign promise, a military buildup, in line with his early confrontational stance toward the Soviet Union.

- Reaganite supply-siders argued that liberal, demand-focused Keynesians had put the cart before the horse. In capitalism, the supply-side decisions of entrepreneurial capitalists were where all the magic happened. There is some truth to that (as Keynes himself had long ago recognized). ([Location 12031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12031))
- But the Reaganites bet on a supply-side horse that turned around and ran the wrong way, or at least in an unexpected direction. As capital was liberated on the supply side, the pattern of capital investment was transformed. There was no going back to postwar industrial society. During the Reagan years, not only did a “postindustrial” economy continue to materialize, but something new and distinctive emerged that has persisted down to this day: a capitalism dominated by asset price appreciation. ([Location 12033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12033))
- The new capitalism would feature some durable new patterns: a surge in service employment, a shift in the share of income from labor to capital and therefore an increase in inequality, a spread of the Houston model of Sunbelt development, a reconfiguration of global U.S. economic hegemony, a commitment to low inflation and price stability, an expansion of debt and leveraged profit making, and more.

When Reagan took office, the inaugurating event had already begun, down the street from the White House at the Federal Reserve.

- President Carter had appointed Paul Volcker chairman of the Fed in 1979. Thus Reagan became president in the middle of the Volcker interest rate “shock.” ([Location 12045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12045))
- Not since after World War I, when, in the context of postwar inflation, the victorious Allies made the decision to return their currencies to the gold standard, had state power so overtly enforced the scarcity value of money capital in an attempt to attack inflation. ([Location 12046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12046))
- Less money would mean less inflation. Interest rates on credit would then set themselves in the market, free from government intervention. However, as the quantity of money was restricted, the cost of credit—interest rates—would increase accordingly. Short-term interest rates surpassed 19 percent in 1981. ([Location 12055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12055))
- Unemployment reached 10.8 percent. The Fed ended the monetarist experiment in October 1982. A macroeconomic recovery ensued in the midst of newfound price stability. The shock worked. The dragon of inflation was slain. ([Location 12064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12064))
- The Volcker Shock was a reboot for both politics and economics. In politics, it brought about a policy regime change not seen since the days of FDR (when FDR had relaxed the scarcity value of money). Surely no government since the Great Depression had believed that government-induced double-digit unemployment, on behalf of deflation, was a legitimate policy option. ([Location 12069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12069))
- Volcker was not a complete believer in Milton Friedman’s monetarism, which argued that economic growth always followed, after a lag, from an increase of the money supply, and that inflation was always and everywhere a result of the money supply increasing too much. The Fed, Friedman thus argued, should always target a steady increase in the money supply that approximated the capacity of the “real” economy to grow—“real” meaning independent of money. Strangely ([Location 12074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12074))
- Volcker surmised that the monetarist targeting of the quantity of money would provide good political cover for the job that needed to be done. By targeting the money supply, the Fed was not responsible for setting punishingly high interest rates. The market was deciding.

- Even if Volcker’s Fed would scrap monetarism, Friedman’s basic argument prevailed. This meant the Fed had to follow a simple and transparent “rule.” It should target a noninflationary and thus “neutral” interest rate, neutral in that it kept the growth of the money supply in line with the growth of the real economy. The Fed had only to set the right interest rate and it could sit back and watch the market economy optimize itself. Inflation could take priority over unemployment, since with low inflation and a stable general price level, employment would find equilibrium at its “natural” market level.

- The high interest rate of the Volcker Shock recruited short-term, speculative hot money into the United States, in search of the generous rate of return on offer. The consequence was to bid up the dollar, securing its role as the hegemonic global currency of transaction and reserve. ([Location 12099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12099))

- The opposite side of the same coin was that capital inflows financed the bulging U.S. trade deficit. In a new global trend, capital ran “uphill” into American capital markets. ([Location 12106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12106))
- In short, the Volcker Shock launched a second, far more novel U.S. global hegemony. After World War II, the United States, like many world hegemons before, was an exporter of both capital and goods to the world.17 After the Volcker Shock, these movements reversed. Now the United States imported global capital and became the consumer market of last resort for the world’s producers. ([Location 12108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12108))
- Meanwhile the consequences of the Volcker Shock were no less significant, or surprising at the time, for the U.S. national macroeconomy. By tightening the money supply, the Volcker Shock brazenly restored the scarcity value of money capital. Just as with foreign hot money, high and volatile interest rates recruited capital into the money form, in search of income from interest rate accrual, in the midst of a sudden corporate purge of not-very-profitable industrial fixed capital. Deindustrialization surged in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt. ([Location 12116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12116))
- The new emphasis was on short-term, financial profit making. The Volcker Shock thus induced a greater liquidity preference. This was all the opposite of Reagan’s promised manufacturing revival. ([Location 12120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12120))
- As the owners of wealth sought security in safe-haven dollar assets, the export of capital to the United States financed the critical role of the American consumer in the global economy—as foreign capital inflows closed the U.S. current account deficit, or its balance of transactions with the world, excluding financial items.

- In some sense, the fixed capital purge had been a long time coming. The U.S. profit rate, especially for industrial corporations, had been in decline ever since 1965.20 Capital moved toward the low-wage Sunbelt South, as well as abroad through corporate multinational investment. Despite the 1977 wave of steel plant closures in Ohio and Pennsylvania, many industrial corporate… ([Location 12127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12127))
- Between 1979 and 1983, the percentage drop in fixed investment in manufacturing structures and equipment was the steepest on record. Employment in durable goods manufacturing fell by 15.9 percent, with the loss of more than 2 million jobs—overwhelmingly male jobs.21… ([Location 12131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12131))
- The origins of this transformation preceded the Volcker Shock. Among industrial corporations, a new conception of capital investment had been developing for some time. Business consultancies and finance-trained corporate managers drew from financial economics, whether it was “portfolio theory” or the “capital asset pricing model.”22 Postwar managers had been committed to growth in… ([Location 12135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12135))
- As profits flagged, time finally ran out on the industrial managerial class. The new goal was to maximize an immediate, risk-weighted “return on equity,” or paid-in capital. Thomas E. Copeland and J. Fred Weston’s Financial Theory and Corporate Policy (1979), for instance, distilled the new thinking.23 The basic point was clear, however: pull capital from less… ([Location 12139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12139))
- That sounds obvious—maximize profits. But the profit motive, over the short or long term, had not been the only postwar managerial consideration, and managers, many of whom lived near production facilities, including factories, were often committed to specific localities. Some were committed to particular production processes. They therefore did not see their investments as always… ([Location 12143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12143))
- financial economics had no concern for physical process or human frictions.

- Meanwhile deindustrialization in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt accelerated, with the Midwest suffering the most. Many working people experienced the new “profit orientation” as something like a shock. In 1980 a round of steel closures hit the Calumet region, south of Chicago and in northwestern Indiana, eliminating ninety thousand manufacturing jobs. Local communities met the closures with “bewilderment” and “disbelief” because many of the factories were profitable. But they were not profitable enough by the new criteria, applied by executives at an ever-increasing distance from the “physical process.” ([Location 12160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12160))
- The new CEO of U.S. Steel, David Roderick, declared that the corporation was “no longer in the business of making steel.” It was “in the business of making profits.” U.S. Steel announced major layoffs in Pittsburgh, shut down the old Carnegie Homestead works, and built a new, highly automated facility in Houston.

- The metaphor of body and plant appeared time and again. Lackawanna steelworker Dick Hughes said, “You feel it’s a part of your life, it’s a part of your body….It’s like getting a part of your stomach cut off, if the plant closes.” ([Location 12182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12182))
- The Fed finally ended the monetarist experiment in October 1982. But first, it began to perform a new function in capital markets. Not only did it help to usher in a greater liquidity preference through high and volatile interest rates, it also took new steps to ensure that transactional liquidity always existed for the owners of appreciating assets. ([Location 12193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12193))
- In 1983 John Shad, the Reagan-appointed chairman of the SEC, informed Congress about the “unprecedented movement of capital” across financial institutions. Money and credit were jumping across “traditional gaps,” overwhelming “regulation by industry categories.” According to Shad, capital was “thundering over, under, and around Glass-Steagall,” the New Deal wall separating commercial from investment banking—such as in new “over-the-counter” markets, for instruments such as interest rate “swaps.”35 Because of the Volcker Shock, bankers had new access to money and credit, even if at higher rates. But if confidence departed, capital could just as easily engage in flight, crippling financial institutions, solvent and insolvent alike. ([Location 12203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12203))
- During the inflationary 1970s, Mexico, like many Latin American countries, had taken advantage of the low real cost of capital and high world commodity prices to borrow heavily in public debt markets. U.S. commercial banks had recycled petrodollars from oil-producing economies into Latin American public debt.36 The high interest rates of the Volcker Shock undermined commodity prices and plunged the world into recession. The price of oil thus fell—one reason the Volcker Shock so diminished inflation in the United States. However, high U.S. interest rates made it more difficult for Latin American sovereigns to roll over their debts. Mexico was the most exposed country, and Citibank was the most exposed U.S. commercial bank. Chairman Walter Wriston had once quipped, “Countries don’t go bankrupt.”37 But foreign investors were questioning that belief. Mexico was suffering from short-term capital flight. In June 1982 the Fed was debating whether to grant Mexico a $600 million credit line, an injection of funding that would be only a bridge loan to a much larger International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. ([Location 12214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12214))
- It seemed that the unintended consequence of the Volcker Shock was to foil even Volcker’s expectations. If any one person was responsible for the global economy at this moment, it was Paul Volcker, and if he could not answer the question, that said something about the fundamental indeterminacy that was being wired into the new political economy. FDR once knew how much gold was fleeing U.S. borders: none, because he had passed an executive order banning it.

- For the Fed, global financial crisis management was to become the new normal. ([Location 12235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12235))
- An epoch was opening, much defined by short-term and potentially fickle global capital movements across space, as time horizons compressed. For that reason, global economic events became not so easy to narrate over time. Even from Volcker’s chair, they were not looking very purposeful. Volcker Shock has another meaning. Volcker, no different from a laid-off Lackawanna steelworker, was surprised by the course of global economic events that had followed from his actions, as well as their seeming unpredictability. ([Location 12236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12236))
- Arguably, in no era has monetary policy ever mattered so much as the era after 1980. For as capital became more liquid and convertible, the Fed’s targeted interest rate became ever more a global benchmark for the flow of global investment, as the Fed—if belief in the presence of a market for a debt ever waned—became responsible for ensuring the transactional liquidity upon which the smooth functioning of one big global capital market was more and more premised. ([Location 12244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12244))
- The Fed ended the monetarist experiment in 1982, returning to targeting short-term interest rates rather than the money supply—lowering interest rates if just a bit, to help ease the recession. ([Location 12248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12248))
- When Congress was finished, after increasing military spending, the rate of federal spending growth was just barely restrained. What was cut steeply was means-tested welfare programs catering to women and children—but not Social Security. The 1981 budget slashed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) by 14.3 percent, food stamps programs by 13.8 percent, and Medicaid by 2.8 percent. Federal eligibility criteria were also restricted, eliminating an estimated 442,000 cases from the AFDC program.44 Employment training was cut to the bone, but states were allowed to enforce “workfare” requirements for recipients, as Reagan had when he was governor of California and had targeted phantom “black welfare queens.”45 In the midst of the Volcker Shock–induced recession, the federal government punished the poor.46 ([Location 12284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12284))
- Unlike what the Reagan administration promised, there was no domestic investment boom in manufacturing. Meanwhile U.S. multinational corporate investment continued to flow abroad, except now at an ever-higher rate.49 At home, tellingly, the value of new U.S. “industrial structures” declined by one-third between 1981 and 1986.50 ([Location 12305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12305))
- Notably, even for nonfinancial American firms, the ratio of net acquisitions of financial to durable assets climbed.51 This had consequences for labor markets. As asset prices climbed, the owners of financial assets, and professionals in the business and financial services classes directly or indirectly employed by them—bankers, accountants, commercial real estate appraisers—saw their incomes swell.52 These incomes then created fresh demand for service and care labor in the lower regions of the income distribution—say, retail, childcare, nurses, and nannies.53 The middle began to hollow out.

- There were tax cuts. However, unlike what Reagan had promised, a surge in the household saving rates failed to materialize. Instead, household debt increased. Effectively, household debt replaced inflation, papering over flat pay.54 For instance, outstanding consumer credit loans, mostly credit cards, sold by commercial banks, doubled during the 1980s.55 Conforming to the post–Volcker Shock pattern, indebted American consumers purchased the manufacturing imports of the world, financed by U.S. capital imports—in this decade, especially manufactures from Japan.56 ([Location 12323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12323))
- In the Age of Chaos, productivity growth continued to disappoint, and it remained severed from average compensation growth. The benefits of productivity gains flowed to the best-off; for many working Americans to sustain consumption, debt growth replaced income growth. ([Location 12331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12331))
- Finally, another great driver of the expansion was federal budget deficits. Supply-side economics failed—the national debt expanded. Snapping up U.S. debt, however, would be a lot of foreign capital. ([Location 12333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12333))
- Credit booms at high rates demand quite confident expectations, and here Reagan’s capital-friendly policies surely mattered. Yet, borrowing at 8 percent required a rate of return greater than 8 percent in order to turn a profit. One way to juice profits was to increase leverage, or to use more borrowed money, rather than one’s own, for the investment at hand. Therefore, paradoxically enough, a credit-fueled investment boom at high rates meant snowballing debt. ([Location 12339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12339))
- If step one during the Volcker Shock was the decision among the owners of capital to hoard cash and earn short-term profits through interest rate accrual, during the post-1982 expansion, step two was indebted speculative investments, to hurdle over high borrowing rates through leverage. Thus the great “discipline of the market,” promised by Carter, Reagan, and Volcker alike, failed.58 Instead, a rather undisciplined upswing in the capitalist credit cycle occurred. Its premise was the belief that transactional liquidity—a funder, if not a buyer for all assets—would always be present in what was fast becoming one big interconnected capital and credit market. ([Location 12347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12347))
- In enterprise, the turn to leveraged asset appreciation required nothing short of a revolution in U.S. corporate governance, in which financiers, including investment bankers, continued to wrest ever more power from an already-floundering managerial class. The weapon was the new gospel of “shareholder value,” which demanded that managers act in the pecuniary interests of shareholders. That often meant slashing wages, foregoing long-term investments, or selling off assets, all in order to benefit the immediate bottom line. There was and is no hard law that says that U.S. corporations must be motivated to maximize short-term profit.59 Most postwar industrial corporations, focused on long-term growth metrics and the maintenance of “organizational slack,” had not even tried. With the shareholder value revolution of the 1980s, the present stock market price of corporate shares newly became the metric of corporate success.

- Pickens never acquired majority control of Gulf Oil, but management paid him “greenmail.” That is, they bought back the shares that Pickens and his allies had accumulated at a price above the going market rate—far above what Pickens’s group had originally paid. Boone, Houston oilman Oscar Wyatt, Jr., and New Yorker Carl Icahn, among other corporate “raiders,” followed this strategy successfully. Icahn even “greenmailed” U.S. Steel.

- Corporate raiders could never have pulled off the shareholder revolution by themselves. They needed help in the capital markets. Joining corporate raiders were institutional investors, especially public and private pension funds. In other words, accumulations of capital that were the result of the postwar politics of pay funded changes in corporate governance that, ironically enough, undermined the politics of pay. The critical economic site shifted from income to property. ([Location 12380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12380))
- If working people began to use debt to compensate for flagging pay and to sustain consumption, then leveraged buyouts demonstrated how property owners could use debt to leverage up their profits from their investments. In all, relative income growth shifted away from labor to capital. ([Location 12383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12383))
- pension funds bought “portfolio insurance,” in which computers automatically sold off stocks from their portfolios if stock prices declined. The academic theory behind portfolio insurance assumed transactional liquidity, “that continuous trading was possible”—that there would always be two sides for a trade, and not everybody would always be on the sell side.

- Furthermore, in 1982 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began selling stock index futures contracts—essentially, an asset that tracked the price of the Standard & Poor 500 (called the “spooze”). Institutional investors, with regulators approving, bought them to hedge their stock market positions. ([Location 12392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12392))
- In 1982, in the midst of a revolution in antitrust law, Reagan’s Justice Department changed its “merger guidelines.” No longer was the goal, as stated in 1968, to “preserve and promote market structures conducive to competition.” The new standard in assessing a merger was only whether its outcome would or would not “maintain prices above competitive levels.”65 This reflected the spreading influence of the Chicago Law and Economics movement, which argued that the only relevant standard for antitrust enforcement was “consumer welfare,” or lower prices—not market structure or barriers to entry. ([Location 12401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12401))
- If managers resisted, the buyout would be “hostile.” To raise cash for the purchase of the shares, buyers secured credit lines from banks, or issued junk bonds—risky corporate bonds paying high yields. This was the final ingredient: the newly burgeoning debt market in junk bonds. They were what made the buyout leveraged. ([Location 12415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12415))
- Spectacularly, employee pension funds, to compensate for their employees’ flat compensation growth, sought yields by participating in leveraged buyouts, which then led newly indebted corporations to slash wages and eliminate jobs—so they could meet their debt obligations.

- Commonly, conglomerates were broken into parts, with many divisions sold off.

- by the mid-1980s a new “common sense” of what a corporation was had taken shape.77 In 1976 two Chicago-trained University of Rochester business school professors, Michael Jensen and William Meckling, had published what was to be one of the most widely cited of all academic economics papers, “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure.”78 A firm, they argued, was a spot market, a “nexus of contracts.” The most important contract was that between a principal (the equity owner) and his agent (the manager). The manager’s job was to maximize shareholder value. Now. The standard postwar managerial profit target had been twenty years; by the mid-1980s, the industry standard for a successful leveraged buyout “payback” was two years.79 Jensen and Meckling’s model assumed transactional liquidity among all assets.

- Corporate boards, buying their shareholders’ loyalty, increasingly tied managerial compensation to stock options instead of pay.

- Discussions of “fundamentals”—what a business actually did—still mattered in valuation, but asset prices, throwing off capital gains, might delink from what was supposed to be their anchor in the “underlying” business profit of the firm, made from using up capital in wealth-generating enterprise and labor. ([Location 12476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12476))
- In the early 1980s, profits from the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate) surpassed those from manufacturing. In 1978, for manufacturing firms, portfolio income (from interest accrual, dividends, and realized capital gains) was 18 percent of total profits. By 1990 it was 60 percent.85 Why bother parting with liquidity—bearing a risk of loss by investing in enterprise, employing labor, making a product, and selling it at a profit above cost—when one could lean back and buy and sell assets in markets fueled by debt (if not threaten to jump out of a window for a hefty fee)? At least, the line between what was thought to be reality and representation in the economy was blurring, and the latter was perhaps getting out ahead of the former—back to P. T. Barnum and confidence games. ([Location 12483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12483))
- The blurring of appearance and reality was a great preoccupation of 1980s cultural “postmodernism.”86 Take what might be considered one of the great postmodern literary genres, “mark-to-market” accounting.87 Postwar managerialism’s “historical cost” accounting had computed profit in relation to the past use of productive capital, or its long-term depreciation. In mark-to-market accounting, the present market value of assets, foretelling future incomes, is what matters. The horizon is perpetually short-term. Future “return on equity,” or the trajectory of the stock, replaces “return on investment,” or the return on the company’s past outlay of resources, in order to produce something and sell it above its cost of production. The distant past is wiped out. So is the distant future, as the future collapses into the present price of an asset, updated by the millisecond.

- That was what Chicago school economists’ “efficient markets” hypothesis theorized: financial markets do not recognize the past, they accurately price the future into the present.88 In cultural expression, that was what the decade’s neon color palette symbolized—the intense but fleeting present moment.89 In the sartorial style of 1980s corporate raiders, a bright color meant the power red tie. The celebrity New York real estate developer Donald Trump self-caricaturized the look. ([Location 12498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12498))
- This boom looked a lot like the growth of cities such as Houston, where the economy did not revolve around the male breadwinning wage, or on long-term fixed investment and productivity growth, but rather on the spread of real estate across space, and on high- and low-wage service employment—and where the principle of liquidity spread outside capital markets and into everyday life.

- Commercial real estate was another unintended consequence of the Volcker Shock story that combined with the unforeseen results of Reagan’s tax policy. Prices had bottomed out during the 1973–74 recession but had begun to recover during the late 1970s, as commercial rents, unlike many streams of income, could be updated to account for inflation. After the Volcker Shock, funding abounded. For instance, Japanese capital poured into Los Angeles real estate.92 Latin American capital, fleeing debt crises, arrived in Houston.

- It was at this moment that Trump arrived in Manhattan bankrolled by his Queens-real-estate-developer father, as well as friendly government tax credits. Trump, leveraging his real estate assets and no less his celebrity, built his Manhattan real estate and Atlantic City casino empire on debt, funded by a “sprawling network of seventy-two banks,” including Citibank, Chase, and Bankers Trust, as well as British, German, and Japanese banks.94 Trump was emblematic of a larger trend. He was a business concern with very little underlying income generation, relative to his assets, which he purchased through bank debt. When his assets increased in price, he used them as collateral for more loans, which became his income, given that his actual businesses usually lost money in the end.

- Reagan’s 1981 tax cut had created a new accelerated depreciation credit for “structures.” Manufacturing was the intended target, but the law also applied to commercial real estate. Companies could sell tax credits to one another.97 The paperwork meant more jobs in “business services” for tax lawyers. Rather than building factories, even industrial corporations such as General Motors began to invest in office building construction, if only for the tax credit.

- Liberalism had long used the tax code to attempt to induce private investment in industry, to mixed effect. The technique now became a near parody of itself, as capital moved—in this instance into leveraged commercial real estate, not industry—through mind-numbingly complex tax-friendly intermediaries.

- In 1982 the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act changed the financial regulation of “thrifts” in the savings and loan industry. New Deal–era regulations had highly limited thrifts’ loan portfolios. In real estate, savings banks were limited largely to the residential market within fifty miles of their location. The pattern begins to look familiar. Here again, 1970s inflation undermined the industry, in this case mostly because so many thrifts’ assets were old home mortgage loans with low, fixed interest rates. The 1982 law let thrifts invest up to 40 percent of their assets in commercial real estate. It increased the federal insurance limit of deposits from $40,000 to $100,000. It also allowed individuals to own thrifts. Finally, it let savings banks accept “brokered deposits” from the unregulated shadow banking sector. Money managers thus cobbled together $100,000 CDs, deposited with thrifts. ([Location 12549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12549))
- Thrifts’ commercial real estate loans climbed from 7 percent of their total assets in 1982 to 20 percent by 1989.101 Credit flowed, mostly, to the fringes of expanding Sunbelt cities and suburbs, like office parks in California and Texas. Many real estate developers chartered or acquired thrifts themselves. They might funnel federally insured brokered deposits through thrifts, into their own “pass-through” real estate subsidiaries.

- Maybe, increasingly this was it: capital rushing into an asset class, throwing off income and creating jobs—for bankers, developers, construction workers, and self-employed building inspectors, appraisers, assessors, accountants, and fraudsters.

- as median male wages flatlined and more women entered the labor force, their absence from the home and their newfound incomes created demand for more service jobs in the care sector.

- Of course, capital did not rush everywhere. As for real estate values, northern black urban property prices continued to fall, as they had been doing since the late 1960s urban uprisings.104 Black migration back to the South advanced. But many northern urban black people—increasingly trapped in jobless ghettos, devalued by capital, and with unemployment and means-tested welfare benefits declining—had no choice but to become entrepreneurial, in the spirit of the times. The informal and criminal economies expanded. ([Location 12574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12574))
- In 1982 Reagan doubled down on Nixon’s “War on Drugs.” Rates of black male incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses surged in particular, but in general white incarceration increased at the same rate as black. The U.S. prison population climbed from around 300,000 to over 1 million by 1996. The United States became by far the most punitive state in the world. Spending on incarceration increased as means-tested welfare benefits and public housing expenditures fell. ([Location 12580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12580))
- Both rates of incarceration and for-profit “public” housing surged in the Sunbelt. In cities following the Houston model of economic development, it was easy to privatize—with so much new development, “public” prisons, hospitals, and other service deliverers never existed to begin with.

- A new world of service work was taking shape. It was socially interactive, consisting of affective, emotional, and care labor.114 These kinds of service labor were still marked feminine.

- Nowhere did the politics of nostalgia play a greater role than in farm policy.

- In 1985 Reagan backed down and signed an expanded farm bill that distributed 80 percent of its welfare to overwhelmingly white farm proprietors or corporations that earned more than $100,000 a year.

- So long as markets believed in the continued presence of transactional liquidity for assets, or just for the debts that funded them, then confidence was maintained, and asset prices might continue to climb. Long, credit-fueled macroexpansions could continue. But the only agent with the ultimate power to guarantee liquidity was a state institution, the Fed.

- When the Volcker Shock hit and a worldwide economic recession broke out, interest rates on funding shot up, resulting in crippling public debt crises—in Latin America and Africa especially. But even some eastern European Communist countries, Poland being the most dramatic case, had gone to the capital markets to attempt to borrow their way out of the industrial doldrums. These regimes doubled down on their investments in capital goods industrialism, in a gamble that failed. Communism would perish.

- in general the rate of productivity growth still disappointed—in that sense, the 1980s was the worst decade on record since the industrial revolution.131 This was much because long-term investment, private and public, was so weak (outside military investments in such things as an interstellar missile system that did not work to fight a Cold War enemy that was collapsing anyway). With money and credit so abundantly available both at home and abroad, most of what the U.S. owners of capital did during this decade hardly deserves praise: in particular, their fostering of a bloated financial sector focused on short-term speculation that was of questionable social value. It was of questionable economic value, too—finance’s contributions to productivity since 1980 have been hard to find in the statistics.132 Meanwhile, as income gains began to flow to the owners of appreciating assets more than to workers, economic inequality widened.

- the new capitalism was hardly the conscious result of any long-term political or economic vision. Instead, a new, persistent pattern of expectations arose, defined by a new preference for liquidity—more transactional liquidity, as in more convertibility across assets, often to aid busy eventful speculation that had no particular purpose or end beyond itself. Paradoxically, a liquidity preference for money or money-like assets generates speculative uncertainty and also offers a potential response to it—the precautionary hoarding of liquid, safe-haven stores of value, as a lull from any moment of disquietude, which have the added advantage of providing the opportunity to instantly jump back into the speculative game.

- Following the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, political scientist Francis Fukuyama announced to great fanfare “the end of history” in 1992.

- Postwar liberalism’s commitment to “equality of opportunity,” back in an era when cross-border capital movements were controlled, was now updated. President Bill Clinton—a Democrat elected in 1992, in the wake of the 1990–91 recession—promised to transcend the old ideological division between left and right politics and move toward a “third way,” a meritocratic commitment to equality of opportunity. In this brand of liberalism, individuals and states alike would have both the freedom and the necessity to seduce global capital investment or suffer the consequences.

- In a popular film of the decade, Terminator 2 (1991), a robot made of liquid metal constantly reliquefies and reforms, reliquefies and reforms. Many once-distinct institutional spheres in political economy and social life became increasingly related, like an ever-shifting Venn diagram. What was public, and what was private? What was personal, and what was political? What was the difference between male and female identities? Were not race and gender mere “social fictions”? Was national affiliation outdated? Boundaries were transgressed, the solid became liquid, seemingly everything was becoming “networked,” so much that it all left little independent standpoint from which to stand back and assess, or to draw new boundaries. Certainly, the standpoint of an independent public interest became very difficult to find. ([Location 12771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12771))
- Why worry about stability, structure, or sphering? The great keyword of the decade, globalization, expressed the sentiment best. Goods and culture flowed across borders. To a lesser extent, people did, too—legal and illegal immigrants.8 Above all, globalization meant letting capital rove, embracing change. It would all work out to the benefit of everyone somehow.

- The dot-com boom did result in fresh long-term investments in IT infrastructure, but it also rode a great speculative upswing in the credit cycle, which levered up asset prices—yielding capital income for the best-off. In capital markets, the contradictory drive of speculative investment ruled, and perhaps never has its ambivalent character been more apparent. Fixed investment in new forms of enterprise and productivity surged. Yet a constant, fickle convertibility meant that speculation also became a short-term end in and of itself. With so much energy and flow, everything could seem to be happening even if nothing much was happening at all. Speculative capital spun its top, converting at a new, digital speed in one big, global capital market. However, if confidence and belief ever faltered, the speculative investment boom might turn to bust—no short-term speculation, no long-term investment. The flight to hoarding cash, the plummet in asset values, and the blow to economic activity in general would then reveal the contradictory character of the credit cycle.

- By the turn of the millennium, the world’s most vibrant economic region was the Transpacific West—specifically, the vast region under the pledged security protection of the U.S. military, including California and Washington but also Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand.13 In particular, capital focused on a location where U.S. military contracts, university scientists, Japanese-design-obsessed engineers, Buddhism-curious hippie entrepreneurs, and venture capital all mixed.

- In 1968 ARPA funded the construction of a network through grants to the first four “network nodes” at the University of Utah, Stanford, UCLA, and UC–Santa Barbara.18 By the time the first ARPANET transmission was sent in 1969, Taylor had quit the Pentagon in protest of the Vietnam War. In 1970 he landed in Silicon Valley to run the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Xerox PARC’s lab was on land leased from Stanford University, the Stanford Research Park, established in 1951.

- In 1956 physicist William Shockley had decamped from AT&T’s Bell Labs in New Jersey and arrived in Palo Alto to live closer to his sick mother and develop transistors. Shockley hired eight young PhDs. In a bizarre turn, following his 1956 Nobel Prize, he started advocating eugenics and founded his own sperm bank. The “traitorous eight” departed and, bankrolled by Sherman Fairchild, son of the first chairman of IBM, founded Fairchild Semiconductor. They used silicon, which amplifies and insulates electricity and possesses extraordinary durability. In 1968 Fairchild begat Intel Corporation, founded by two Fairchild founders, Gordon E. Moore and Robert Noyce. ([Location 12869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12869))
- Just as Ford had built automobiles as a hobby while working for Edison, Wozniak kept his day job at Hewlett-Packard. Jobs, for his part, had worked as a line assembly engineer at Atari, Silicon Valley’s greatest video game company. Atari was funded by Sequoia Capital, the first “Sand Hill Road” venture capital firm, founded in 1972 by Don Valentine, a former employee of Fairchild Semiconductor.

- Jobs went to Xerox PARC to study the Alto, believing that Xerox’s investment entitled him to sample its technology. What he and his engineers saw—a windows-based graphical user interface—led Apple to quickly rethink its designs. That same year, 1979, in Seattle, Bill Gates purchased an operating system called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products for $50,000 and sold it as MS-DOS to IBM, for use in its own personal computer, introduced in 1981, a competitor of the elegant, Wozniak-designed Apple II—no less a marvel in its own right than the Alto.

- Apple was a profitable company by any possible criterion, but capital valuation was changing. Investors were considering more than operating profits. They were capitalizing into the value of companies, speculatively, the possible results of the innovative ideas of Silicon Valley’s recombinant networks of relationships. Expectations had long figured into capitalization, of course, but the focus was changing, from the prospective profits to be yielded by the use and thus depreciation of fixed capital (building something somewhere) to the more intangible capital of ideas, or “human capital,” and social networks, or “social capital.” As much as wires and hardwire, these forms of capital proved very important to the rise of the new economy.

- Next up, two National Science Foundation–funded Stanford graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, developed a search engine, BackRub, that first went online in 1997 on Stanford University’s website. It used algorithms to “crawl” and rank websites based on their density of citations. Ingeniously, the search engine “scaled,” meaning it became even better whenever more information was added to the Internet. The domain name Google.com was registered in September 1997. At the time, Ethernet connections were then replacing dial-up connections. In 1999 venture capital arrived for Google both from Sequoia and from Kleiner Perkins. In exchange for the license rights to the search algorithm, Google granted Stanford 1.8 million shares. Google possessed the best Internet search algorithms—another highly capitalized idea that was not embodied in any physical capital equipment. Google was soon worth billions.35 ([Location 12963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12963))
- Given its 1990s acceleration by the capitalist credit cycle, aspects of it surely resonate with past speculative investment booms, like the stock market craze of the 1920s. Back then, at the dawning auto-industrial society, financial activity sponsored new long-term fixed investments, just as the 1990s saw new long-term investments at the dawning of an Internet-based economy. (By contrast, the 1980s had been a moment of speculative disinvestment, with little creation.) ([Location 12982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12982))
- At the same time, something truly new was arguably at work during the 1990s. The hypervaluations of many new economy firms that made no business profits whatsoever opened up the possibility that financial asset appreciation might delink altogether from business profit making, demanding the establishment of new (nonprofit?) criteria for what should be valued in economic life. ([Location 12985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=12985))
- at a minimum, perhaps financial appreciation could be appropriated toward other ends—“social investment,” as it now goes—rather than merely enriching the owners of capital. Something like that had happened after the 1920s speculative investment boom, when the New Deal and the labor unions successfully redistributed industrial incomes away from capital.

- By 2000 the market capitalization of publicly traded corporations in Silicon Valley was nearly $750 billion, while the market capitalization of the entire American auto industry was $136 billion. Capital had never before moved so quickly into a new asset class. By 2000 the state of California had the ninth-largest GDP of any national economy in the world.

- 2000, Cisco received $40 million a day in online orders. Sixty percent of them were automated by the website. Cisco then subcontracted the vast majority of production to an ever-shifting, low-wage “global supply chain.” The company formally employed 34,000 people (sitting on an average of $250,000 in stock options, smartly appreciating), mostly in design and logistics. Subcontractors manufactured products and shipped them directly to customers, with the brand “Cisco” stamped on the resulting bricolage. For this reason, through the globalization of supply chains, world trade in manufactures shifted during the 1990s—from between economies, like Japan and the United States, at relative parity, to the export of manufactures from the low-wage regions of the world to high-wage regions.

- In the 1990s the high modernist, reinforced concrete factories of the Machine Age were replaced by more malleable, portable, and cheaper factory “sheds.” In office design, long corridors and boxy executive office suites yielded to cubicles and shared desks.57 Breakout spaces replaced conference rooms.

- Enterprise became so liquid that it became more difficult for individuals to recognize corporations as collective agents responsible for their fates. Instead, individuals internalized both their successes and failures. This new economic personality has been called the “entrepreneurial self” or the “human capital self,” living in a constant and unending search for publicity and appreciation—the kind of person who in the twenty-first century would be obsessed with their social media “likes,” or even become a well-compensated “influencer.”61 This individual is future-oriented to the extreme, often discounting the past. For when improvisation is constantly called for, one’s past attachments—loyalties to people, places, and companies—can render one inflexible.

- during the 1990s, the female workforce-participation rate, that is, the percentage of adult women in the remunerated workforce, long on the ascent, leveled off at 60 percent. By contrast, during the same decade, the male workforce participation rate kept declining, falling below 75 percent. The rapid closing of the gender gap in earnings that had begun during the 1980s now slowed as well. Most significant was the entry of highly educated, high “human capital,” married women with children into the labor force. It helped increase incomes at the top of the household distribution. Less educated and less skilled men and women began to marry less, widening household income inequality from the bottom of the income distribution.

- the long-term rate had remained stubbornly high even when, to stoke the “jobless” post 1990–91 recession recovery, the Fed brought short-term rates down to 3 percent in 1993. Even if inflation was not yet presently appearing, Rubin speculated that bond traders were pricing inflation into the long-term rate. What the federal government had to do was balance the federal budget, signaling fiscal rectitude. Rubin could not read bond traders’ minds, but his reasonable analysis was that the high long-term interest rates of the 1980s had created a high hurdle rate for profit making, inducing leveraged speculation. Lower rates would free up capital for long-term fixed investment. Rubin thus recommended catering economic policy to the whims, real or perceived, of capital markets.

- after the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s, new legislation had forced banks to hold more “risk-free” capital. The Fed, enforcing the regulation, included U.S. Treasury bonds in that category, and so banks accumulated them. As long-term interest rates declined, the value of existing bonds, paying higher rates, increased. Flush with profits, banks parted with liquidity and made new loans, expanding credit.70 Altogether a new upswing in the credit cycle and allied macroeconomic expansion commenced.

- Following the IMF’s advice on how to recruit capital, the Mexican government had slashed public expenditures and pegged the peso to the dollar to guarantee foreign investors that it would not devalue their investments. Mexico, the model citizen, was rewarded with capital inflows. Yet, more manufacturing began to locate in even-lower-wage parts of Asia than expected, undermining the promise that NAFTA would induce U.S. multinational investment in Mexico. Meanwhile Mexican farmers were overwhelmed by lower-cost U.S. agricultural producers. Millions of Mexicans began to illegally immigrate to the United States—some becoming Silicon Valley gardeners and janitors.

- Rubin and his inner circle at the Treasury, including a young Timothy Geithner, learned that they could use the overwhelming force of government authority to provide transactional liquidity to credit markets and overpower any hint of panic.

- In 1995 the dollar began to rise in value. U.S. trade deficits reappeared. So did capital imports from abroad, which helped finance American consumers’ purchases of the world’s goods.

- The new political-economic settlement was that government must facilitate the mobility of capital, which, by assumption, would automatically flow to its best possible use, benefiting consumer welfare, so long as there was market competition. If the speculative upturn in the credit cycle rained capital down on Silicon Valley dot-com companies, they must, by assumption, have earned it. The Fed had the most important task, to manage the short-term interest rate in credit markets, lowering them in support of the new economy, while raising them, if need be, to guard against inflationary pressures. In a pinch, it could lower rates or intervene in open markets to guarantee transactional liquidity in capital markets. In the meantime, the federal government could continue to deregulate.

- The “era of big government is over,” he declared twice in his 1996 State of the Union address, the year he would sign into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.80 The act was everything Ronald Reagan had ever wanted. It ended a New Deal entitlement—federal-government-guaranteed support for indigent citizens. Aid to Families with Dependent Children became Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. By instituting block grants, it devolved much responsibility to states for determining eligibility criteria and benefits. It also let states contract welfare to for-profit corporations or to religious nonprofits (called “charitable choice”). It capped benefits at five years, lifetime.

- The old Progressive regulatory concept of a “public utility” was basically dead. In antitrust law, the new gospel among jurists, heavily influenced by the Law and Economics movement, was that the only relevant standard for antitrust law was consumer welfare, meaning short-term consumer prices—not market structure or barriers to entry in enterprise.84 The blithe assumption was that the market would maintain competition by itself, if left alone, without much state oversight or legal coercion. Monopolistic tendencies would not naturally arise. In this spirit, the Telecommunications Act promised that deregulation would promote “vigorous economic competition,” which always stood to benefit consumers. That alone was equivalent to the “public interest.”85 The Clinton administration noted the high level of telecommunications investment after 1996 and patted itself on the back.

- during the 1990s a new global, cosmopolitan consciousness was born. During the twentieth century, by choice or by necessity, industrial capitalists had tied their fates to nation-states.88 Now many owners of wealth were not so sure. New York, London, and Tokyo, all centers of finance, became recognized as “global cities,” where trends in food, fashion, and design began to move in unison. ([Location 13290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13290))
- new forms of private “global governance” emerged, in lieu of state regulation, whether arbitration agreements among multinational corporations, or entities such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), with its offices in New York, London, and Tokyo, among other cities, and through which banks created uniform contract language for very lightly state-regulated global financial derivatives markets.90 To some extent, sharing much in common with one another, global cities appeared to detach from their national locations.

- In 1997 IMF managing director Fischer argued that “put abstractly, free capital movements facilitate a more efficient allocation of savings, and help channel resources into the more productive uses, thus increasing economic growth and welfare.” That was the late-1990s gospel. But the actual concrete evidence since then for a link between financial openness and greater economic growth is not very good.

- Pulsating global financial movements are quite difficult to narrate historically, which says something about the degree to which they are difficult to put under political control. At the same time, global finance capital, unlike what Fischer predicted, can undermine the more slow-moving global economy of physical production and trade. In the late 1990s, as capital markets globalized, the most important global link to emerge was between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. From this linkage, a series of contingent events unfolded that threatened to bring down the entire global economy.

- Usually, LTCM bet that prices between assets would converge to their historic norms. Traders then hedged the risk of that trade by making counterbets, by writing derivatives contracts with investment banks, using the same models.

- With the spread of global commerce, trade cumulatively begat more trade, production cumulatively begat more production, and economic activity brought increasing returns. Throughout the world, millions of people escaped economic deprivation.6 In particular, China, which joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, led the rapid growth of the world’s low-wage manufacturing export economies. Chinese regions began to link together with many U.S. multinational corporate supply chains. As wealth multiplied, global commodity prices boomed, given the fresh demand that new economic production created for commodities all over the world, whether it was Brazilian iron ore, Indonesian rubber, or Russian oil. Meanwhile in the Eurozone monetary union, introduced in 1999, banks binged on cheap dollar funding. European economies “financialized”—finance growing at a greater rate than production—to a greater extent than anywhere else, even the United States.

- An upswing in the global credit cycle meant that money capital financed long-term investment in wealth-generating trade, enterprise, and employment. Prosperity boomeranged. Gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of world GDP, depressed relative to the postwar past ever since the 1980s, now even began to rise after 2002.8 But the upswing in the credit cycle also meant that money capital could fund short-term speculation for its own sake in liquid assets. Liquid assets, furthermore, potentially enabled a precautionary propensity to hoard, at the expense of either short-term speculation or long-term investment.

- The Chinese Communist Party did not direct its manufacturing export earnings to domestic investment, which was far more state-directed than dependent on the global financial system. Instead, China chose to invest much of the savings earned from its exports in the U.S. capital market, especially in U.S. public debt. These Chinese investments helped finance the U.S. trade deficit, which helped sustain American consumption of Chinese-produced goods. This was the post–Volcker Shock configuration of American global hegemony, on steroids. ([Location 13513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13513))

- That they would rise became ever more important, for the post-2001 business expansion featured a historically abysmal labor market, a “jobless” recovery. The labor force participation rate actually declined (the male rate falling, female rate holding steady). Meanwhile average household incomes did not recover their pre-2001-recession level until late in 2005. So how could American consumers, who were not saving, afford to buy the flat-screen TVs of U.S. multinational corporations that assembled them using Chinese labor?

- One reason was that the well-off kept doing well. The new economy was not a sham.

- Through a “wealth effect,” capital gains on leveraged property ownership could translate into new incomes for American homeowners. The housing stock thus became a new personal income flow. The age’s capitalism of asset price appreciation had found a new asset class to concentrate on, as many ordinary homeowners were given the chance to participate in the game of credit-fueled asset price appreciation.

([Location 13610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13610))
- how exactly did Enron make profits? The answer was accounting gimmicks and, given the blessings of the era’s commitment to transactional liquidity, trading with itself. If a seller finds no buyer for an asset at a profitable price, the seller could find a way to become the buyer, too—truly, the magic of the market. This kind of fraud had appeared in the savings and loan industry during the 1980s, when some individuals used credit to trade the same piece of real estate with themselves over and over again at a higher price, each time booking a profit.

- Enron CFO Andrew Fastow and Enron’s corporate lawyers created a series of “off-balance” shell corporations, called “special purpose entities,” so that the company could carry out such trades internally, creating the illusion of profit. Critically, the SEC had let the company use mark-to-market accounting standards, which meant that the values of its assets were determined by present market price—not by the price when purchased, or the running cost.

- Astutely, Greenspan noted of Enron that any firm was “inherently fragile” if its market value rested on “capitalized reputation,” or public confidence in its business model, rather than on “physical assets,” which could produce a product to be sold, above the cost of its production, for a pecuniary profit.

- the 2001 Bush tax cuts budged activity so much. The law slashed marginal income tax rates across the board between 3 and 5 percent. The Bush administration came back for more tax cuts in 2003, and the budget was back in deficit, after Bush had inherited a budget surplus from Clinton. “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter,” Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, declared.24 True, foreign capital—from Japan especially in the 1980s, from China especially in the 2000s—had proved willing to finance U.S. budget deficits. They purchased U.S. Treasury bills, depressing long-term interest rates, because they wanted assets denominated in the currency of the global hegemon, and they were happy to finance the U.S. trade deficit, if only to fund U.S. consumption of their goods.

- By the time American troops poured into Iraq, the Fed had reduced the federal funds target to 1 percent, where it remained until the summer of 2004. The Age of Chaos had opened with the high interest rates of the Volcker Shock, which reestablished the scarcity value of money capital. Now the historically low short-term interest rate of the Greenspan put induced a most extraordinary speculative upswing in the global credit cycle.

- Easily, the economy of asset price appreciation moved on from 1990s dot-com corporate stocks to the 2000s residential mortgage market. But 2000s economic life had other qualities.

- Silicon Valley and other places surged forward, creating high-paying jobs for highly educated and well-networked people, whose high incomes created fresh demand for typically lower-wage service employment—in retail and in restaurants, for yoga teachers, and for life coaches. Two-thirds of all U.S. jobs by now were in the “nontradable” sector—and thus more subject to local conditions.

- Still, these companies, racing to the top of corporate valuations, employed fewer people and stimulated surrounding businesses less than high-valued firms had done in previous eras. They had smaller footprints, compared to, say, General Motors in the 1950s. In 2010, 79.5 percent of all high-tech jobs were in the hundred largest metro areas.29 Not surprisingly, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle did well. So did, say, Austin, Texas, and Rochester, New York, specializing in optical technology, or Dayton, Ohio, with its research cluster in radio frequency identification.

- At last, in the 2000s, a number of its companies, though not all, found ways to realize profits from operating a business enterprise. Two strategies stand out. One was new: the extraction of data for sale to marketers. The other was quite old: the anticompetitive drive for monopoly. Both strategies, however, used the same means—prodigious long-term capital investments—to achieve the same desired end of being the first mover in a new IT business so as to become impervious to market competition. ([Location 13692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13692))
- Growth at all costs, heedless of losses, let alone profits, remained a corporate strategy during this decade. This led to some aggressive investment strategies and monopolistic tendencies—defying the governing Law and Economics movement, which had stripped the law of many antitrust enforcements on the assumption that short-term, rational profit maximization among firms would always increase competition to the benefit of all consumers.

- Unlike Wal-Mart in the 1990s, Amazon in the 2000s was not responsible for lowering retail prices—that new economy effect, cheaper goods, now trailed off. Amazon most benefited “busy, high earning households.”30 For these high-earnings households, increasingly, were two-income households, with less time for shopping. Amazon offered not lower prices so much as time savings. Because of Amazon, at the opening of the twenty-first century, the average well-off American consumer could, lying in bed, order with a click on the laptop or a swipe on the phone, various products from around the world and reasonably expect their rapid arrival on their doorstep in two days. But Amazon’s rise to market dominance through below-cost pricing meant it began to acquire the power to prevent market competition—as well as place demands on its suppliers. Further, when profits arrived at Amazon, they would come not from consumer retail but rather from Amazon Web Services, which offered data storage and “cloud” computing for businesses.

- The “data exhaust” left behind by so many Google Internet searches was personal information that, if extracted and aggregated at sufficient scale, then smartly manipulated by sophisticated algorithms, could be sold to companies and marketers as predictive guides of consumer preference—another synthetic construct of data, a “behavioral” rather than a financial asset. Google’s Gmail, introduced in 2004, the same year of Google’s IPO, allowed Google to scan (private?) correspondence and scrape it for marketing purposes so that Google could sell “banner” ads on its websites, with companies paying for “click-through” rates.

- Amazon made many fixed investments in its logistics and delivery networks, which better facilitated commerce—like investments in canals and railroads more than a century ago. But productivity growth in general disappointed because few potentially productivity-enhancing innovations appeared, given the overriding emphasis on finding ways to gather and use data to predict or even modify consumer behavior.

- Altogether in the twenty-first century, much because of mergers and consolidation, “competition…declined in most sectors of the U.S. economy.”40 For large firms offering no better services but operating in markets with little competition—telecommunications, airlines, and health care stand out—profits climbed. Thus one reason the labor share fell so precipitously after the 2000s was that consolidated, large corporations enjoyed monopsony power in labor markets—workers could not so easily bargain for higher wages, as there were so few firms with which to bargain.41 It was the same old story: the reality of increasing returns to economic activity came with the risk that first movers would acquire a monopoly share of a market. On top of that, firms used politics to acquire and reinforce such advantages.42 Any student of the nineteenth-century U.S. economy—think of the railroads—could have foreseen this possibility.

- Between 1990 and 2011, China’s share of world manufacturing exports climbed from 2 percent to 16 percent. From 2001 to 2011, the Chinese share of U.S. manufacturing imports climbed from 10.9 percent to 23.1 percent.43 After 2000, the “China trade shock” was a great contributor to the starkly diverging economic fates of American economic regions.

- After the Volcker Shock, the total number of U.S. manufacturing jobs had held steady at 17 million. Between 2001 and 2003, however, the United States lost 3 million manufacturing jobs. Exposed to international competition, U.S. manufacturing was one sector where concentration and market power did not increase.44 In addition to facing continued automation, any job was at risk of loss if a low-wage alternative was available overseas. Asia and eastern Europe had hundreds of millions of new wage earners, many newly lifted from economic deprivation even if by other criteria—poor working conditions, breached employment contracts, and unpaid wages—exploitation was rife.

- According to one estimate, “import growth from China between 1999 and 2011 led to an employment reduction of 2.4 million workers” in the United States. The above map of 2000s U.S. “trade exposure” reveals that cities such as Detroit, Buffalo, and Providence were hit hard. So were rural areas of Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Indiana.

- Decades earlier, U.S. trade with industrialized economies like those of Germany and Japan, which might have enjoyed some advantages but not so many, could not have had such an effect. The China “shock” did. For decades, U.S. manufacturing jobs had been shifting to the low-wage low-unionized South. By 2000 southern migration had played out, and jobs now went overseas.

- There was zero political management of the process. According to economic theory, displaced workers should migrate, and some of them did. Houston’s population boomed, and metropolitan Detroit experienced a population loss of 25 percent (nearly what New Orleans suffered after the 2005 Hurricane Katrina). But not everybody wants to or can move as much as economists’ models imply they should. ([Location 13779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13779))
- Between 2000 and 2005, average pay remained flat, as it had at the beginning of every jobless postrecession recovery since 1982. Prime-age U.S. labor force participation declined, as the share of women in the remunerated labor market finally stalled at about 60 percent in 2000. The male labor force participation rate kept falling. For those lacking education credentials at very young ages, lifetime earnings prospects had turned bleak.

- The population shut out of the labor market altogether fared worse—drastically worse. Data reveal that beginning in 1999 there were marked increases among white men aged 45 to 54 without college degrees in deaths due to drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol-related liver mortality. Such “deaths of despair,” responsible in the first two decades of the twenty-first century for an estimated “600,000 deaths of midlife Americans,” disproportionately took place in regions where the jobless recovery festered. The phenomenon did not appear in other countries. ([Location 13795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13795))

- Having social and economic life increasingly organized by networks had consequences: they not only “scale” and fluidly mutate, as recognized in the 1990s, but also have the capacity, it turned out, to rigidly exclude. Inequality increased, with respect to income and wealth, in the realm of abstract numbers. But more concretely, in a parallel dynamic of social exclusion, many individuals and groups were simply ejected from the production side of the new economy.

- In the cities, elites self-removed by marrying only each other or finding common cultural tastes with respect to, say, cuisine. Political polarization surged in tandem.53 Even estimations of human worth sharpened. Mark Zuckerberg’s warped conception was that “someone who is exceptional in their role is not just a little better than someone who is pretty good. They are 100 times better.”54 So corporations should hire only the exceptionally talented—and pay them well, due to their “human capital”—not the born losers.

- income politics were fast becoming anachronistic. Naturally enough, an economy oriented around property asset ownership benefits the rich, since by definition they tend to own most of the property. But there was an option to expand the ranks of ownership—if not through the actual redistribution of assets, then through access to credit, to purchase them. During the 2000s, politicians and financiers alike engaged in a genuine attempt to execute this strategy, through the vehicle of home ownership.

- In finance, the largest investment and commercial banks raced to provide mortgage loans to existing and aspiring homeowners. They believed that they had discovered the end of the capitalist rainbow—a way to make guaranteed profits, without incurring risk or sacrificing liquidity. The way to do it was to buy and sell liquid mortgage-related assets that they had synthetically engineered among themselves, and that they traded for a profit among themselves, funded by short-term interbank money markets among themselves, with everything then insured in the event of any loss, by another set of derivatives trades conducted among themselves.

- a Wall Street funding, rating, and trading cartel had emerged.58 The principal players were: the five great investment banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns; three mega-commercial banks with their own investment arms, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Bank of America; the three ratings agencies that stamped mortgage-related assets “investment grade,” Moody’s, Fitch’s, and S&P; and large, mortgage-originating savings banks (thrifts), led by Washington Mutual and Countrywide. The giant insurance company AIG backstopped it all. ([Location 13860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13860))
- Americans were not flocking to buy new homes yet, so much as pulling cash out of their homes by either refinancing their mortgages or going into debt through home equity loans—in which the home’s present value, and not the past value at which the owner purchased it, is the basis and collateral for a loan at a lower rate than the existing mortgage. In this way, rising home prices translated into fresh funds to sustain the personal consumption that pulled the U.S. and global economy out of the early-2000s doldrums. ([Location 13878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13878))
- In 2003 one in four American homeowners refinanced their mortgages at lower rates, some 15 million homes, cashing out $427 billion. Homeowners extracted another $430 billion through home equity loans. The Fed estimated 45 percent of extracted home equity went toward “medical bills, taxes, electronics, vacations, or to consolidate debt.” Another 31 percent went for “home improvements.” The remaining purchased “more real estate, cars, investments, clothing, or jewelry.” ([Location 13881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13881))
- Geographically, the housing boom exhibited variation. In high-income cities, such as New York and San Francisco, prices soared because real estate markets were tight. In steady urban markets, such as Chicago and Houston, prices rose, but at nowhere near so fast a clip. And in the regions of the born losers, no so-called fundamentals were at work—just the capitalism of leveraged asset price appreciation, dangerously democratized. Many of these regions were among those gutted by globalization and the China trade shock. ([Location 13886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13886))
- In the west side of Detroit and inner-city Cleveland, both longtime black neighborhoods, the expansion of “subprime” mortgage debt—loans extended to borrowers with bad or risky credit—strongly correlated with households’ negative income growth. ([Location 13890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13890))
- During the 2000s, residential lending geographically correlated with regions where labor incomes had flatlined for decades. Debt compensated for income growth. Cleveland was a city with a high volume of subprime mortgage lending, often predatory. Lending concentrated in the relatively poor east side, including in predominately black neighborhoods. ([Location 13894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13894))
- People with flagging pay and labor earnings prospects tapped their homes to maintain—not increase, but simply maintain—their level of personal consumption. ([Location 13898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13898))
- Here is how it worked.66 Mortgage brokers were closest to the ground in contact with borrowers. Savings banks, or thrifts, whose business model had long been in home mortgage lending, also originated mortgages. Since the savings and loan deregulations of the late 1970s and early ’80s, thrifts no longer originated mortgages locally, holding the investments on their books or selling them to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for packaging into mortgage-backed securities. Now the goal was to “originate and distribute”—to make loans and, instead of holding them on the books as investments, to sell them as quickly as possible in a competitive national and ultimately international market. ([Location 13906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13906))
- If homeowners were desperate for loans to compensate for flagging pay, investment banks were no less eager to fund and buy those same loans. ([Location 13918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13918))
- The banks packaged the loans into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). They cobbled together individual loans, then resliced them into different “tranches” of bonds, with different levels of risk and thus interest payments. They paid fees to rating agencies, Moody’s especially, to rate the MBSs according to their risk of default. ([Location 13922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13922))
- Moody’s, a publicly traded company after 2000, used mathematical models, just like the banks, to predict default risk by plugging in historical price data that hailed from a time when the market was different, because it was vastly more geographically disconnected. (The late-1990s hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management had previously made this mistake.) They did not inspect actual mortgage loans. ([Location 13925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13925))
- Banks sold the tranches in over-the-counter markets to investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, and university endowments. Or they held on to them as their own investments. In 2004 banks’ “private label” securitization surged past Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had long offered government subsidies to the mortgage market. With confidence in risk management due to MBS diversification high, banks believed they could profitably offer loans to riskier, subprime borrowers. Between 2003 and 2007, there was $4 trillion in new MBSs. ([Location 13928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13928))
- During the 2000s, banks and ratings agencies used the same models and historical price data they used for MBSs to engineer mortgage-backed CDOs. Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup specialized. Through the CDO process, 80 percent of A- and BBB-rated mortgage MBSs newly became AAA-rated CDOs. ([Location 13937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13937))
- The final link, was the “credit-default swap,” or CDS. A CDS was effectively an insurance contract that paid out if a CDO defaulted, using the same models and the same data. Here the London-operations-based financial products division of AIG took the lead. AIG wrote $20 billion in CDS contracts in 2003 and $379 billion in 2007. It collected 0.12 percent of the notional value of the swap per year, effectively an insurance premium. Its largest customer was Goldman Sachs. Since a CDS was an over-the-counter derivatives contract—it did not exchange in a public market, like the New York Stock Exchange—it was not regulated much. ([Location 13941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13941))
- Finally, to mask leverage, the banks used off-balance-sheet “structured investment vehicles” (SIVs) or accounting gimmicks—both practices recalling Enron. ([Location 13952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=13952))

- Their assembly line had only one constraint. It needed fresh material, actual people who bought—and even sometimes lived in—homes.

- Short-term interest rate hikes by the Fed beginning in 2004 did not cause a dent in long-term rates. The global demand for long-term U.S. debt—whether safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, government-sponsored enterprise debt, or even banks’ “private label” MBSs and CDOs—was simply extraordinary.81 Between 2000 and 2006, led by China, foreign owners of U.S. Treasury debt climbed from $0.6 trillion to $1.43 trillion, from 18.2 percent to 28.8 percent of all U.S. debt. Foreign ownership of Fannie and Freddie bonds increased from $348 billion in 2000 to $875 billion in 2004.82 European banks especially were buying up extraordinary amounts of American MBSs and mortgage-referenced assets.

- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fearful of having lost 20 percent of market share between 2003 and 2006, tried to win it back. They ramped up leverage 75 to 1 and also bought riskier loans. Origination standards degraded. In 2006, 27 percent of all new mortgages had no or low documentation proving income, and in the summer the number of mortgages defaulting within months of their issue doubled.

- After more than a year of “stress” in capital markets, on September 15, 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. The short-term funding of debts in global capital markets evaporated. Fearful, banks stopped trading and lending with one another. The magic of the market, the belief that there would always be liquidity in the form of a willing buyer for any asset, went up in smoke.

- Lehman was leveraged as high as 40 to 1.1 That meant that for every $40 it borrowed, it had $1 as a cushion in the event that its creditors all suddenly came calling.

Undoubtedly, without the 2009 stimulus, the Great Recession would have been worse economically.105 Politically, the stimulus was nonetheless a great failure. In the aggregate, it was simply not enough to close the gap in demand. At the same time, if only because of its reliance on tax cuts—given the dearth of public investment plans, and the lack of political will or capacity to carry them out anyway—the stimulus lacked the facility to push economic life in any particular, better direction. Republicans reaped great political benefits from these shortcomings. ([Location 14583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14583))
- The Fed had lost control of the long-term interest rate before the crisis, when raising short-term interest rates in 2004 did nothing to raise long-term rates. Now, with short-term rates at zero, long-term rates remained stuck high. So in another unconventional monetary policy, the Fed purchased billions of dollars of long-term bonds, mostly U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. mortgage bonds, hoping to bring down long-term rates. The goal of lowering the pecuniary return for parking cash on the sidelines was to induce greater immediate private investment and spending. The strange name for this policy was “quantitative easing.” ([Location 14590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14590))

- An administrative agency, the Fed, which prided itself on “independence,” standing outside democratic politics by its very design, could attempt to induce private investment only indirectly. Quantitative easing could depress long-term interest rates and assist the reflation of asset values, fueling inequality, but it did very little to reshape the kind of economic investments made.

- In another of the age’s jobless recoveries, after 2008 the owners of capital watched their liquid assets appreciate first—before the recovery of ordinary labor incomes. This time, the asset class was not homes, but largely corporate equities, much like during the 1990s. Conforming to the post-1980 trend, the rally was supported by the extension of debt. Not household debt—households deleveraged after 2008, one reason why weak household spending and demand for goods hobbled recovery. Public debt as a percentage of GDP rose until 2014, before stabilizing until 2020. But after 2014 a massive extension of corporate debt took place.

- When in March 2020 financial markets collapsed after the outbreak of COVID-19, the Fed, like in 2008, came to the rescue, cutting new paths in the arena of post-2008 “unconventional” and “accommodative” monetary policy. In fact, the Great Recession already appears to have only been a dress rehearsal for 2020. In March 2020, immediately the Fed stepped in to prop up asset prices, including supporting the troubled corporate debt market, something it did not do in 2008, because the corporate debt market was not then so distressed, but also because officials believed that to do so would have been a dangerous public encroachment upon private markets.

- Thus, many pre-2008 trends carried over into the 2010s. Investment and productivity growth remained weak. Infrastructure dilapidated. A fossil fuel–based energy system persisted—entrenched further by a 2010s domestic oil fracking boom, capitalized by the decade’s cheap credit.

- After 2008, as has been the case with every recovery during this age, eventually the expansion began to tighten labor markets, and income gains occurred at the middle to the bottom of the distribution, in this instance beginning in 2014. At this point, the expansion was led by a rising share of personal consumption in GDP, in another continuity: the enduring significance of the American consumer for the global economy. ([Location 14684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14684))
- The problem is that no matter how long, the briefest of downturns wipe out much of the gains from the expansion.

- In sum, to say that the 2010s American economy was roaring—maximizing its potential, distributing its deserts justly—is to engage in nothing short of “truthful hyperbole,” as Donald Trump memorably branded his business strategy in 1987’s The Art of the Deal. It is something that plays “to people’s fantasies.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.” ([Location 14691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14691))

- In fact, the American economy has been stuck in a liquidity trap of a broader kind, and for decades now. The Great Moderation, as Ben Bernanke branded the era in 2004, turns out to be a Great Repetition. For we are trapped in a recurring economic pattern dependent upon converting leveraged asset price appreciation into fresh incomes, a process not dependent in the first instance upon rising labor incomes, but upon the credit cycle and the magic of the market—beliefs and confidence among the owners of capital that there will always be liquidity in capital markets. What is now abundantly clear is that that liquidity is a product of state power, lodged inside the U.S. central bank.

- One bet seems safe. Politics stands to assert more authority over economics. But an authority wielded by whom, on what basis, and toward what ends? Giant technology corporations, promising greater ease of life? Authoritarian states, sustained by a politics of anxiety, recrimination, and fear? Reconstituted democratic publics? Institutions of global cooperation and governance? All of this remains to be seen, but the answers to these questions are likely to constitute the… ([Location 14736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14736))

- The New Deal state that emerged from the Great Depression and World War II shifted income generation, in distributive terms, away from the owners of capital to labor. Largely, it did so through income politics, the central… ([Location 14748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14748))
- the capitalism of the Age of Chaos has not been controlled through such means; given the fickle character of capital in this era it likely cannot be. The key is to transform the structure of investment. For that, income politics, which redistribute the spoils… ([Location 14750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14750))

- I have emphasized that American capitalism is an especially forward-looking economic system, in which expectations of the future play a prominent role in determining the present—whether it was seventeenth-century British rulers’ fantasies of Atlantic empire, white Americans’ dreams of racial domination and of conquering the continent, the innovations of industrial revolutionaries, mass expectations of abundance and employment after World War II, Silicon Valley techno-utopians, and on.

- the American economy has reached a point of repetition. By relying on the Fed to keep the music playing, we have turned the economy into a broken record. ([Location 14764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14764))
- Capitalism’s future orientation is a complex issue. It grants the owners of capital, charged with the task of when and where to invest, power over others. But investment is a broad phenomenon. At stake is not only ledgers of profit and loss. Investment concerns to what end and on what terms a community as a whole decides to direct its energies, capacities, and aspirations.

- Ethically, capitalism’s dependence upon projections of the future is its greatest potential virtue, as it urges us to imagine the possibility of a future that is qualitatively different from and better than the past—that includes post-capitalist futures.

- Not coincidentally, the United States, perhaps the most capitalist of all countries, has long been distinguished from other countries for its pronounced historical amnesia. In American capitalism, the urge to dispense with the past has led to many flights of economic fancy. Most recently, this happened with the new economy of the 1990s, when it was believed by many powerful figures that the U.S. economy had somehow moved “beyond history.” End-of-millennium faith in a finance-led vision of globalization, which persisted, incredibly enough, after the panic of 2008 and over the Obama years, may have been consigned to the dustbin of history by Trump’s 2016 election and then COVID-19. But we still live in the aftermath of that project. ([Location 14770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082ZQHT63&location=14770))
