### Highlights

- there is something badly off about how Paul is being read and proclaimed for much of the time as these legions march. Indeed, our deepest conviction is that for much of the time the proclamation is just plain wrong. The wrong God is being announced, the wrong account of Jesus, and bound up with this is a distorted account of those on the outside of the church, with an especially damaging definition framing Jews. A great deal of damage is being done in the name of Christ as authorized by Paul. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=134))
- it is not so much that the wrong gospel is being proclaimed and that is the end of the matter (although it can be). The situation is more subtle, as one might expect, when evil is involved. The right gospel is still present in much Protestant teaching, but it has been cleverly reframed so that its key truths have been lost. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=140))
- there is a clear path through the mayhem to the truth—to the recovery of Paul’s authentic gospel in all its wondrous power, and to the ensuing renewal of church life and cultural engagement. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=145))
- We begin, that is, with revelation, and with a revelation focused on Jesus Christ. Everything begins here, and unfolds from here, and Paul himself attests clearly to this starting point with his famous encounter with Jesus as he was near Damascus. Since this gospel grounds everything that follows, we spend some time unpacking this Christ-centered revelation through the first three chapters. It is vital that we understand the mode in which truth is present here (so chapter 1), the God it attests to (so chapter 2), and the way it understands the work of Christ on our behalf (so chapter 3). ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=153))
- Paul knows a God who is characterized fundamentally by revelation and by love. And he proclaims our salvation on the basis of what Jesus has done for us as he came to us as a person made of flesh, faithfully walked to the cross, died, was buried, was raised, and ascended. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=158))
- all of the Easter events are critical to the account Paul gives us of what salvation is, resulting in what we call a “participatory,” “resurrectional,” and “transformational” gospel. And the role of the Spirit is vital here as well, resulting in an implicitly trinitarian account of God’s activity among us, from which it follows that the great ecumenical creeds affirm our developing description. Paul refers to this gospel in a very abbreviated way by using the short phrase “in Christ,” or something… ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=160))
- We introduce in chapter 4 our hypothesis that a particular model of the gospel that is very different to what we have just set out is nevertheless frequently present within much teaching on the basis of Paul. Indeed, it is often presented as the gospel according to Paul. But we hold that it is not, and for reasons that will become increasingly clear. We will… ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=167))
- book by John Piper, The Future of Justification, to articulate the structure and details of the problematic gospel that we hold is distorting. Piper can be taken as a faithful… ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=171))
- This model of salvation has two characteristic phases or stages that track the journey of an anxious non-Christian (or Jew) to salvation, from “works of law” to “faith.” It is often known as “justification” because the texts it relies on in Paul frequently use the Greek verb dikaioō to frame this journey, and translators usually translate this Greek word in that way.… ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=173))
- is often presented as the correct account of salvation in Paul—or at least as the place where any account of salvation in Paul should begin—on the basis of 10 percent of what he wrote (and in fact just under 10 percent: it is frequently held to be the right reading, counting at times rather generously, of 172 of the 1,791 verses written by Paul… ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=176))
- Two key protagonists have stepped forward and dominated much debate in this relation with a so-called “new perspective” on Paul that ostensibly solves the problems caused by the “new perspective on Judaism” associated with Sanders and his post-Holocaust insights: J. D. G. Dunn and N. T. Wright. So we look carefully at their approach in subsequent chapters but, while finding several of their insights helpful, nevertheless conclude that their solutions to this painful problem fail to convince. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=205))
- problem in place in relation to Paul’s interpretation: his apparent utterly unfair characterization of Jews as mean-spirited legalists—and this problem plays directly into a mean-spirited characterization of non-Christians in general. The crisis of Pauline interpretation has deepened. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=209))
- in chapter 11 we identify what we take to be the key culprit and then sketch out the basic contours of our solution. The spectrum of tensions resolved unsatisfactorily by Melanchthon, the further tensions modern theologians and scholars detect between two basic models of salvation operating in Paul alongside one another, and the appalling description of Jews that is so acutely painful and dangerous in a post-Holocaust age, are all, it turns out, generated by the presence of JT within Paul’s description. It is JT that is demonstrably doing the damage at all these places. And so at this critical moment we simply have to ask if JT is really the right reading of Paul. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=214))
- Justification theory does after all only lay claim to about 10 percent of what Paul wrote, and it is spelled out in full in parts of just one letter, Romans. So might it not be the expectation that JT is present in Paul that has led to it being found in his letters? If so, by removing that expectation—in the way that we might take off a pair of rose-tinted glasses—might we see that Paul is saying something a little different in these texts? We go on to argue that this is in fact the case. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=220))
- Justification theory readers can be very attentive and accurate readers of Paul. We argue, however, that at a few critical moments they have overinterpreted Paul’s arguments, and JT has snuck into the gaps in these ancient texts and flipped a few key commitments around, finding itself by doing so. When this process is detected and resisted, Paul’s JT texts turn out to be talking about something that is very similar at a basic textual level to JT but very different at the theological level. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=228))
- First we address, in chapter 12, Romans 1:18—3:20, which is really the key to the problem and to the solution. This is where JT launches, from an apparent failure by a Jew to be “justified through works of law.” But we show how this approach badly misunderstands what Paul is trying to do, and we offer a different interpretation of Paul’s argument that subtly but significantly reorients it. Several features of the text that JT struggles to account for are resolved by our new approach, so we are confident that it is the correct one. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=238))
- when we are aware of the influence of JT on our reading, we can compensate for that and see that Paul is really talking in these texts about something else. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=260))
- We have excluded the Pastorals from consideration here (i.e., 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus). If they are included then the percentage of JT in Paul drops much further. It really only occurs, even arguably, in 1 Tim 3:16, where the verb is used. Note, many scholars would work with fewer letters than we do, excluding Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians from Paul’s authentic letters. This judgment increases the prevalence of JT—and we suspect it is often partly because of their loyalty to JT that this judgment of exclusion is made. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=266))
- Ever since the Reformation it has been fashionable in certain Protestant circles to speak blithely of the perspicuity of Scripture. A desire to democratize the Bible led to the wishful thinking that the proper interpretation of all Scripture is self-evident. But if anything is self-evident about the Bible, it is the glaring fact that a myriad of possible interpretations set forth by well-meaning exegetes compete for our allegiance. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=272))
    - **Note:** This is from the foreword, not Campbell. But it is an excellent point concerning emphases on the perspicacity of Scripture.
- Campbell and DePue convincingly show that the 10 percent of Paul’s texts that are the source of JT should not be read as Paul’s theology of salvation, but as Paul using a Socratic rhetorical device to set forth the arguments of his theological opponents—arguments that Paul then goes on to refute. Paul’s theological opponents (known as “the teachers” in Beyond Justification) were legalistic Jewish believers who were harassing Paul’s gentile converts, teaching that salvation for gentiles required Torah observance. The teachers seem to have had little or no understanding of the salvific accomplishment of Jesus’ death and resurrection—they appear to have regarded the resurrection of Jesus as God’s vindication of a righteous Torah teacher. For Paul, the resurrection of Jesus is not merely vindication, but the raising of the human race from our sinful, fleshly condition. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=295))
- Paul’s so-called JT texts are found primarily in his letters to Galatia and Philippi, where the teachers have already arrived and troubled Paul’s converts, and in his letter to Rome, where Paul anticipates the soon arrival of these missionary teachers. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=301))
    - **Note:** This highlight is from the foreword by Brian Zahd (sp).
- In these letters, Paul employs the rhetorical devise of Socratic debate in reproducing and refuting the legalistic “gospel” of the meddlesome teachers. The catastrophic mistake in Pauline interpretation has been the failure to recognize these Socratic debates, and thus to conflate and confuse Paul’s reproduction of the teachers’ legalism with Paul’s gospel of liberation. It is little wonder that read through the lens of JT, Paul’s letters so often lack coherence. For if we fail to recognize the Socratic debates as such, we literally end up with Paul arguing with himself (and making no sense), instead of Paul arguing with the legalists (and making perfect sense). ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=303))
- It’s the sort of thing that once you see it, you cannot unsee it. And once you see it, it changes everything! Instead of a thin JT gospel—which is not Paul’s gospel at all, but Paul’s lampoon of a false gospel—we discover Paul’s robust gospel, one that Campbell and DePue describe as a participatory, resurrectional, transformational gospel. At last we come to see that salvation is not achieved by retributive justice, but by participating in the death and resurrection of Jesus. Salvation is literally found “in Christ,” as Paul says over and over. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=309))
    - **Note:** This is from the foreword. Matches my experience, too.
- We need to think hard about who God is, which means that in the same breath we must think hard about how we know about God. A little counterintuitively, how we learn about God determines who we think God is, because how we find God leads to where we find God, and that in turn tells us who God is. And the stakes are high as we try to answer these questions. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=327))
- We grasp the truth about God only because God has first grasped us.1 The term theologians generally use to describe the disclosure of the truth about God by God himself is “revelation,” which literally means “unveiling.” God unveils himself to us and thereby shows us what he is like. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=337))
- Christ’s revelation is the proclamation, and there is no other. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=362))
- the zealous advocate of Torah and its Jewish commentary suddenly became the ardent advocate of pagans joining the Jesus movement—an entirely different career trajectory. God had suddenly interrupted his work with this radical new vocation. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=378))
- The very thing we were doing for God can turn out to be something that we are doing ourselves against God thereby resisting God and in the name of God! ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=382))
- But it is clear nevertheless that Paul himself was part of what we would now consider to be a kind of terrorist group—a religiously motivated death squad—whose particular interpretation of its Scriptures and traditions led them to endorse violence against those whom they thought were unacceptably different. Paul and his colleagues presumed that God was a God who commissioned people to punish and to kill those who were interfering with God’s righteous purposes. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=392))
- On the road to Damascus he was grasped instead by the fulfillment of the religion he was already a part of—a fulfillment, to be sure, that he wasn’t expecting. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=412))
- we need to pause here for a moment to think about what it would be like if a pastor in our own church inserted some extra clauses into the Nicene Creed and then proceeded to address a local issue from the pulpit on that basis! Yet this is basically what Paul does with the Shema when he writes, Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. (1 Cor 8:6) ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=445))
- Paul has included Christ quite precisely within the wording of the Shema, distinguishing between the two figures of the Father and the Lord all the while subtly holding onto their unity and their divinity. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=460))
- an accurate grasp of this truth is central to the very identity of the church. They clarify and repeat the basic truth about God that has been revealed to us. And they basically say that when we see Jesus we see God. We really need to let this truth sink in. We now understand in the light of this that there is simply no “part” of God hiding behind Jesus waiting to be found; there is no divine nature that is more real or true than Jesus. Jesus is God and he reveals the very nature of God fully. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=488))
- God became present among the Corinthians through the activity of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, who searches the “depths of God,” revealed God’s secrets to the Corinthians, disclosing “what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor human heart conceived” (2:9–10). In other words, a revelation took place, and the Holy Spirit thereby communicated to the Corinthians, in a profound and deep way, what God is like. The Spirit was revealing Jesus through Paul’s teachings and other actions but the basic agent at work within this event, driving it and shaping it, was God’s Spirit. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=511))
- Paul understood humanity’s relationship with God the other way around. It may be construed as a journey of sorts but it is a story of God journeying all the way down to us. In the person of Jesus, God comes to humanity, coming still further through the Holy Spirit, gathering people into his family. In this journey God finds us and discloses to us what he is really like, so a Trinity of divine persons is working together to draw us back to God. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=529))
- How do we know without a shadow of a doubt that Paul’s claims about God being revealed through Jesus are accurate?” And we would reply, like Paul, “Because the same process of revelation still holds—because the same God actively reveals himself to us in just these terms, in just this way, right here and right now.” ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=539))
- The only way we grasp the truth about God is for God to grasp us by telling it to us again and again and again. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=543))
- all persons, made in God’s image—which we are—are defined in the same way: by their relationships with one another. Human persons too are relational to the point that being relational is what makes them persons. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=701))
- God did not change to become more loving when Jesus arrived. Rather, the one who is both human and divine, Jesus, provides us with the clearest picture of what God has been like all along—a communion of love that has existed prior to the creation of the cosmos. Indeed, it is this loving communion that explains the creation of the cosmos. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=750))
- Douglas has argued elsewhere that the letter we know by the name Ephesians was probably the letter written by Paul to a community in Laodicea that he had yet to meet. Colossians, which was written at the same time, speaks of this companion letter and this destination in 4:16.29 (Laodicea and Colossae were just half a day’s walk apart, and were situated in the same river valley in what is now western Turkey.) ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=763))
- Paul penned “Ephesians” from jail. (He was probably locked up, Douglas suggests, somewhere to the east of Colossae, possibly in the important town of Apamea. This town lies between Colossae and the region of Galatia, in what is today central Turkey.) ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=768))
- “Ephesians” is consequently the closest thing we have to a systematic theology from Paul. It answers the question, “What does it mean to be a group of Christians?” ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=774))
- like many Jews in his day, Paul is probably conceptualizing sin/s here in terms of financial debts. As we will see shortly, this problem of debt is only one part of the human plight. But it is an indicative one. There is a sense in which we have harmed God and taken something from him—we have loaned from him without repaying, or have even just robbed him outright—and now we need to pay him back. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=834))
- Of course an important question now arises. What happens if we throw God’s loving plan off course (this being a question we have already touched on)? How does a God of love act when those he loves have turned their backs on him? He will rescue us—the ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=881))
- we also need to bear in mind that Paul’s position here in Romans is articulated in deliberate contrast to the sunnier views of certain opponents he was anticipating arriving in Rome whom the apostle thought were dangerously naïve about the challenges people face. ([Location 963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=963))
- these “teachers,” as some scholars refer to them,41 held that God’s written instructions in the Scriptures could help everyone out. “Read, obey—get circumcised if you are male—and be saved.” On one level, it was as simple as that. Hence, while these teachers viewed humanity’s existence in Adam as problematic, it was far from hopeless. Attention to God’s instructions in the Scripture would fix everything. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=968))
- He observes—arguably rather more realistically—that while part of the human mind might joyfully recognize God’s instructions given in the Bible, people will not always carry them out. Indeed, the presence of these instructions creates new opportunities for people to transgress: ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=972))
- Moreover, humanity does not seem to have any ability in and of itself to resist or to break away from these negative desires: “For I know that the good does not dwell within me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do the good lies close at hand, but not the ability” (Rom 7:18). ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=989))
- in chapter 7 of Romans Paul famously dramatizes sin not just as a small lapse in judgment or a mistake but as a dominating force or power—“Sin” we might say with a capital “S.” Sin “deceives” through the commandment(s) and then goes on to wage war on us, to enslave us, and to imprison us: ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1003))
- For Paul, Sin is vastly more serious. It is an evil force that has captured humanity and occupied its very constitution, constantly assaulting any desire to do the right thing with compelling alternative suggestions. In this situation, we are not free in any full or ultimately meaningful sense. Our willing and acting are contested domains, caught up in a great struggle. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1010))
- Paul’s constant emphasis on oppressive powers speaks to the sense in which individual people are caught up in a cosmos that is itself disordered and harmful. Our world both sustains us and assaults us. Our environments give us life but only at great cost, with ingenuity and hard work, and their unpredictable disorders can still catch us up in vast dislocations that harm and even kill us—floods, earthquakes, plagues. And we are caught up in the grip of vast historical forces beyond our control that manipulate and frequently coerce us. Systems and states and classes carry us to and fro; we cannot free ourselves from their strictures and diktats. Moreover, at bottom these forces can be malevolent. Deep tendencies can be at work seeking only to damage and to destroy. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1023))
- Paul’s account of death articulates a critical insight for us at this moment. It shows us how, from God’s point of view, sin and all that it contaminates does not and must not have a future. It must be terminated, which is to say, it must die. It must end. And this makes sense. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1037))
- The entire cosmos, as Romans chapter 8 tells us further, has been “subjected to futility” (verse 20) and is in “enslavement to decay” (verse 21). This fallen world must end one day. That is, our contamination is too deep and comprehensive to allow of some simple separation of the good from the bad; we are shot through with evil to the point that everything is polluted and must be shut down. The entire rotten mass must be eliminated. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1043))
- But what will happen to us in the midst of this deserved termination? The good will perish along with the bad, the personal with the impersonal. The wheat will be burned with the tares. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1047))
- Will not the entirety of God’s plan to gather us into communion thereby come to nothing as he closes the door rightly on our evil? Will the death of everyone and everything frustrate God’s cosmic purposes? ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1048))
- Even if death has the first word in God’s response to evil it will not have the last. As many Jews in Paul’s day knew well, God is not a God of death; the God of Israel is a God of life. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1051))
- We must go through death, but we must then be recreated after our deaths so that we rise and live in a new, perfected way that is free from the contaminations of sin and evil. We must be terminated, then raised and transformed. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1060))
- C. S. Lewis captures the point nicely when he asks us to contemplate becoming a crab or a slug to share life alongside those species in their respective habitats, to bear their burdens, and ultimately to save them. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1102))
- It is a fairly simple point so it is easily missed but we need to appreciate it fully. The Son of God, fully present in the person of Jesus, was dead and buried and so his flesh was also dead and buried. The evil desires within him thereby perished, and the vulnerability of the fleshly body to the suggestions of the evil powers living in the cosmos inhabited by flesh thereby ended as well. The Jesus who has died has had all his assumed and problematic existence as fleshly terminated. The first critical step has consequently been taken as God creates a way out of our current situation. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1106))
- He writes in 2 Corinthians 5:14 that “one has died for all; therefore all have died,” meaning by this that Jesus’s death creates a new existence beyond the flesh for all of humanity. Everyone in Adam can now move beyond their construction as Adam, which means as fleshly, thanks to Jesus. A doorway into a new, saved, and perfected condition has been opened. And we should be especially careful not to try to limit things when Paul says “all” here, however uncomfortable this might make us. This is, after all, what the text of the Bible says. ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1119))
- That is, we might be tempted to think, perhaps without even realizing it, “Paul probably means all Christians or all people provided that they meet a certain set of criteria. Surely Paul is not including in Jesus’s death people that I don’t particularly like.” That is, we limit the significance of what Jesus does. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1123))
- Paul tells of Adam in the light of Christ. We know that for Paul part of the problem we face is that sin came into the world through Adam and death thereby spread to all.53 But when Paul articulates this in Romans chapter 5, he makes a point of showing just how superior the resulting scope of Christ’s assumption of our fleshly condition is to Adam’s story. As a counterpart to the reach of Adam, Paul views Christ’s act of assuming humanity’s sinful condition of flesh as universal—as humanity-wide. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1129))
- (Eph 2:4–7) Paul is clearly not talking here about Christ’s enthronement as taking place exclusively in the future. He envisions this as having taken place already, with Christ seated on high at this very moment. But the further twist is that we are somehow thereby resurrected and seated with the liberating King Jesus as well. We are “in him” and therefore alive and raised up already as well. Indeed, for Paul this resurrected and enthroned location is the key to our current life in community with one another in the church, where we live beyond the power of sin and are able to respond to God’s will for us with a full and joyful obedience. This is one of the most crucial theological insights Paul ever gave us into God’s work on our behalf through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.

- A quick survey of some of Paul’s most important summary texts indicates that he really did believe that we are presently resurrected in some way, on some level, within Jesus. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1186))
- Paul’s most famous assertion of this situation, however, is probably Galatians 3:28, which is best read along with its two preceding verses: All of you who are in Christ Jesus are, by means of that fidelity,57 sons of God. For you have been immersed into Christ; you have been clothed with Christ. There is no “Jew” or “pagan,” no “slave” or “free,” no “male and female.” All of you who are in Christ Jesus are one and the same. (Gal 3:26–28)58 ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1196))
- To have left the old age behind definitively is the same thing as to claim that the new age has begun and is decisive. Race, class, and gender no longer determine our lives.59 Being a “son of God” (that is, a “child of God”) is what counts. And so, in Colossians 3 Paul makes the same basic claim in relation to ethnicity and class: ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1208))
- To live beyond the present age, and in the coming age, is to live beyond a mind gripped by evil lusts and oppressed by evil powers. It is to have taken the impress of a new image who has died and left the flesh behind, being raised in new, pure state. Hence, it is to be able to act like that image, Christ himself, obediently, lovingly, and wholeheartedly, and to do so now. It is to have been liberated and set free from the age of Adam even as we still walk through it. (Hallelujah!) ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1226))
- There is no way out of our current cosmos except through death because sin and all that it contaminates must die. But in equal measure there is no future without our resurrection and recreation. It is this act that brings God’s great cosmic plan fully back on track. Moreover, even as Jesus’s resurrection guarantees the completion of God’s plan at the end of the age, the Spirit introduces that “future” into our “present” now, claims Paul, by way of our transformed minds. We think like Jesus already. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1231))
- a particular theory of how we are saved, rooting that account principally in Romans chapters 5 through 8. And it will not be unfair if from this point onward we call this Paul’s “gospel.” This theory “proclaims the good news”—as the Greek word for “gospel,” euangelion, suggests—that God has resurrected us in Jesus Christ, so it is really a very Jewish story of salvation with this heavy investment in eschatology. The new twist is the proclamation that Jesus’s glorious resurrection and ascension guarantee our resurrected transformation in the future, in the new age, after our deaths—or at the second coming, Paul would remind us; whichever comes first. And, in equally good news, Paul tells us that this resurrection impinges already on our thinking and acting so that we are empowered to live now in a godly fashion, despite the constant pressures from the lusts in our flesh and the seductive operations of evil powers on us from without. ([Location 1380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1380))
- scholars like Schweitzer point out that after all this careful investigative work has been completed we can nevertheless see that when Paul addresses localized problems he almost always applies or develops the foregoing theological insights grounded in participation, often summarizing them with the phrase “(you are) in Christ” or a close equivalent. Underneath Paul’s arguments, driving them, is his resurrectional gospel, with our partial resurrection through Jesus being referenced by Paul in terms of our ongoing life “in Christ.” ([Location 1402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1402))
- The vast majority of what Paul teaches is explained with reference to being in Christ, which is simply the brief evocation of the resurrectional and participational gospel we have just described. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1412))
- a smaller, minority set of passages seems to speak differently—at least as they are usually explained to us. Of the many verses we have from Paul’s authentic letters,64 approaching 1,800, this distinctive, countervailing cluster of words and arguments appears in around 172, which is just under 10 percent of what he wrote.65 We will refer to this distinctive language in what follows as “justification,” since this is how it is usually referred to. ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1413))
- coordinating the interpretation of Paul’s justification material with what he wrote in the other 90 percent of his texts is one of the central puzzles of modern Pauline scholarship. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1422))
- We must know the 10 percent like the backs of our hands if we are ever to resolve the question of its integration with the 90 percent. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1427))
- with respect to the Bible in general, and Paul in particular, we already have certain expectations in place about what we are reading well before we start reading him for ourselves. We all stand within “traditions” of interpretation that help us to read, just as we have been tested and then taught to wear spectacles to help those of us with challenged eyesight to grasp the words on a page or a screen with clarity. Once we are reading with the help of our glasses, we don’t notice the adjustments our brains have already made to their lenses (and so on), although we certainly noticed that process when we first put on a new set. ([Location 1444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1444))
- Just so, we have often been taught that Jesus’s death on the cross, faith, justice, the law, and salvation all mean something very specific—and important!—and when we find these words in Paul’s texts we tend to assume we already know what they mean and how they cohere together, and our reading tends to confirm this prior viewpoint. The ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1448))
- In short, what we call justification theory—hereafter JT—is a particular combination of received expectations concerning what certain words and phrases that occur in around 10 percent of Paul’s texts mean, along with how they fit together into an extended account of salvation, and it has dominated much of Paul’s interpretation since the Reformation. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1455))
- The account of justification that Piper advances in his book against Wright is an especially cogent example of how JT works and of how it reads certain key texts in Paul. His treatment also makes the point nicely that justification is a theory. So when people speak of “justification” in Paul, even though they are, strictly speaking, referencing just a word that Paul uses in a variety of ways (i.e., the nominalized form of the Greek verb dikaioō), they generally mean that this word, read in a certain way, evokes arguments in certain key texts that are best read ultimately as a theory about how we get saved—in terms of something called justification.

    - **Tags:** #orange
- Much of JT is dominated by Paul’s supposed description of “the situation of the world,” to quote Piper, which is based almost entirely on a particular reading of Romans 1:18—3:20.75 There Paul seems to begin his argument specifically by saying that all individual human beings have an accurate and enduring knowledge of God’s expectations for them either by analyzing the cosmos or by looking inward. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1481))
- Romans 1:20–21 states this clearly,76 and this is the theory’s foundation—the thing upon which everything else rests. (Note, this looks initially like a rather different starting point for the gospel and its truth claims from the account supplied in the previous three chapters, where information about God came through Jesus and the Spirit by revelation.)

    - **Tags:** #orange
- This is a critical step in Piper’s articulation of JT that must be noted carefully. He has ended up by this point in his account arguing that God’s rightness is defined in terms of moral demands made of humanity that function like rules or laws, which means that God himself is functioning here above all like a judge. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1538))
- God is a judge—and a certain sort of judge—and the basic relationship between God and humanity is consequently legal. That is, God relates to us primarily through laws which he oversees, adjudicates, and enforces. ([Location 1541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1541))
- The definition of just what is right by these laws is, moreover, according to Piper, self-evident. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1543))
- 4. Reward or punishment result from fulfilling God’s demands (or not) ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1544))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- It follows directly from what we have just learned that a conditional logic lies at the heart of JT. It is not enough for Jews and gentiles to have access to God’s demands; they must fulfill them, and this means all of God’s expectations. If they do so, then they will uphold God’s glory and be rewarded. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1545))
- But if they fail to do so flawlessly and therefore turn away from God’s glory, they will be punished: “Jews and Gentiles will receive or not receive eternal life on the same terms,” that is, “‘according to . . . works,’ not according to their ethnic or religious advantage” (p. 105).80 God is clearly relating to humanity, whether Jew or pagan, in terms of rules and laws, which specify conditions that must be fulfilled if the judging God is to stay in relationship with them. ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1547))
- We should note here as well, most importantly, that God’s rightness is now further defined as retributive in the sense that actions must elicit the appropriate payment or recompense from God in response; the Latin verb retribuere from which the English word retribution comes means “to pay.” ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1552))
- The righteousness of God, or his rightness, is now clearly interchangeable with his justice, defining that justice in retributive terms. And this last qualification needs to be born in mind because “justice” can be defined in so many different ways.81 God’s retributive justice is now going to be the key aspect of his character. It will drive the rest of the salvific progression, ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1557))

- Piper neatly summarizes the situation thus far by saying, “Paul operates with the Old Testament understanding that the deepest meaning of God’s righteousness is his unwavering commitment to act for the sake of his glory. The belittling of his glory by all humanity is the problem Paul sets up in Romans chapters 1 to 3” (p. 68), although we have also learned from Romans chapters 1 to 3 that this belittling has a quite specific legal content. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1596))

- Disobedience to God’s law is “belittling,” and retribution is the appropriate form of justice by way of response. When your glory is belittled you respond with punishment. Hence there is a very real sense in which, according to this gospel, the restoration of God’s glory can only be achieved through the universal application to humanity of the death penalty.

- And although Piper does not spell out these considerations in detail, he clearly endorses this dimension within JT with his repeated emphasis on justification by faith alone. This is noteworthy, moreover, because Paul never actually uses this phrase. (It appears just once in the NT, in Jas 2:24.)86 But the phrase fits into the logic of JT very well—to the point that Luther added it to his translation of the Bible in Romans 3:28. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1684))
- we need now to appreciate that the distribution and influence of the basic model of salvation that he endorses—of JT—is hard to overestimate. It is everywhere. ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1694))
- The theory appears in recent scholarly and ecclesial journals,92 in confessional statements and declarations,93 and in evangelistic tracts.94 So when it comes to the interpretation of Paul, JT is a bit like the God it discerns in the cosmos—omnipresent if not also omnipotent. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1703))
- Justification theory only occurs, after all—and counting generously—in just under 10 percent of what Paul actually wrote. ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1710))
- We need now to appreciate very clearly, if we do not already, that the 10 percent of Paul’s texts involving justification exert an influence out of all proportion to their size because of their perceived importance for key Reformers. Luther, along with many of his colleagues and followers, are often remembered as viewing justification as foundational to any account of the gospel, and the two things were even identified by him on occasion. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1835))
- This claim is recognizable immediately as hyperbole, however—something Luther was famous for—because justification material focuses on the journey of the individual Christian rather than on Christ himself, and Luther at his best is relentlessly focused on Christ. But the equation is nevertheless frequently reiterated, often in contradistinction to some notion of Catholicism. ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1839))
- many Protestant and post-Protestant traditions, and especially those that root themselves directly in the turbulent events of the sixteenth century, view JT as their key denominational identifier or distinctive. The very identity of Protestantism as an authentic recovery of the heart of the gospel and hence as a legitimate divergence from Catholicism is held by many scholars and preachers to rest on an account of the gospel in terms of JT. ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1843))
- How does the 10 percent of material in Paul that, read in a certain way, delivers JT, relate coherently to the 90 percent that he wrote everywhere else, which emphasizes a highly transformational and participatory approach to salvation based on being resurrected in Christ? (And we should note that the Reformers emphasized this participatory material in Paul a great deal as well.) ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1847))
- The longest letter Paul ever wrote, moreover, was Romans, which was the first of Paul’s letters to appear in the New Testament canon precisely because it was the longest. (The Pauline letters are basically arranged in order of length.) ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1856))
- Melanchthon found that although justification material only occurred in 10 percent of what Paul wrote, its largest concentration (Romans 1:16—5:1) occurred in what Paul wrote first; this material occurred first of all in the first great Pauline letter. As a result of this Melanchthon felt that it was reasonable to treat this material as Paul’s gospel of salvation and then sequence all Paul’s other material after it as a second phase within salvation, which is what seems to happen as we read on in Romans (reading this letter, to reiterate, as a treatise on systematic theology). ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1859))
- what do we do with the material that follows Romans chapters 1 to 4, and that ultimately undergirds 90 percent of what Paul wrote? Melanchthon has a reasonable answer. The material in the second phase is usually designated “sanctification,” and it tells us, Melanchthon suggests, how to act as disciples—how to go on in the church—after we have entered the church by way of justification and faith. Hence for readers of Paul like Melanchthon this participatory material is not Paul’s soteriology or even his gospel and it is certainly not where theology begins. Paul begins with JT. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1867))
- after we have been justified then we need to get on with being sanctified—and justification does not involve that much for us, apart from faith—and participation describes the dynamics of this new situation and its implications. It is as if we enter a new delightful but strongly-walled garden by way of justification; our faith and our faith alone is the key that unlocks the gate. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1872))
- So the 10 percent is the wall around the 90 percent specifying its all-important gate; we enter the 90 percent through the gateway of the 10 percent, and hence only by going through the 10 percent can we get to the other 90 percent! ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1876))
- shortly we will suggest that some major problems are present here. It is as if the wall does not really fence off this garden; it presupposes a very different sort of garden inside its boundaries. Moreover, the garden we do find in Paul, once we begin to explore it carefully, asks us to set up a very different sort of boundary, with different entrances and different ways of getting in. Arguably it is even a garden without walls, surrounded by inviting fields and paths. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1884))
- Any wall erected by JT is consequently the wrong sort of construction altogether for this sort of garden. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1887))
- Many of the defenders of the classic Protestant reading of justification contend that JT is the gospel and that denying or modifying JT in any way undermines the gospel. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1888))
- Maintaining that JT is the gospel and advocating in turn the subordination of everything else Paul says to JT—subordinating the 90 percent to the 10 percent—obscures and undermines the real Pauline gospel, which is actually found in the 90 percent. It will become apparent, that is, as we press deeper, that Paul’s real gospel—in something of an irony—has been held in “a Babylonian captivity” for at least five hundred years, imprisoned by a false account of his gospel inherited from certain descendants of Luther (although arguably not from Luther himself) that has prefaced and overridden it—JT.

- these two models of salvation contradict each other at the most fundamental level. In particular, their accounts of the nature of God are different, and not just a little different; they are utterly divergent. Piper’s gospel of JT is based on a God of retributive justice whereas the gospel of resurrectional participation is based on a God of love, and these are different Gods. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1905))
- Melanchthon’s solution unworkable.101 His suggested arrangement of this material in a simple sequence of salvation followed by discipleship—of salvation by justification followed by discipleship by sanctification—is just going to come apart. It is an attempt to hitch a trailer to a fish. These two things are just different. They don’t fit together and they were never meant to. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1911))
- The United States in particular has a special fondness for doing things this way, which is to say, for organizing society in terms of rules that must be enforced if broken. US politics rests on laws and consequently it is conditional in this legal sense from top to bottom. “If you observe X and Y then you will be safe and unbothered, but if you break X and Y then you will be apprehended and appropriately punished.” ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1918))
- The way that we exchange goods and services in almost all of our economic and cultural domains is based on contracts. Indeed, capitalism is unthinkable without them. So most of us have signed important contracts—maybe for a job, or perhaps a book deal—and those of us involved with the direct provision of goods and services are signing them all the time.102 Every purchase that we make is a contract. And every time that we do this we are committing to a conditional relationship. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1923))
- we are saying when we sign a contract, or even tacitly invoke one, that we will fulfill certain conditions in order to receive certain promised rewards. If we fulfill the stipulated conditions then we will receive what we contracted for, and if we don’t then we won’t: ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1928))
- This sort of arrangement between parties feels quite natural to us even though it is, in fact, culturally constructed from top to bottom. Capitalism is, we should remind ourselves, a relatively recent entrant onto the human historical stage, gathering steam, both metaphorically and literally, from the eighteenth century onward.103 It is understandable, nevertheless, in view of the vast influence of contracts and their legal conditions on our politics, society, and commerce, that in the first quarter of the twenty-first century we would be tempted to think that God operates in this fashion too. ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1937))
- Christians growing up in highly productive societies of which they are quite proud find this a very “natural” way to think about God, and so many do. (Note the powerful influence of a “prior understanding” here.) ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1942))
- what happens if we suppose that God constructs his relationships with us in this way—that he has made the cosmos rest on the rule of law and the enforcement of legal and contractual relationships and their conditions? The consequences are theologically disastrous. ([Location 1943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1943))
- A God of contract would not be the God definitively revealed in the person of Jesus Christ. Why? Because Jesus revealed to us a God characterized by limitless love, and love is fundamentally unconditional, not conditional in a contractual sense, and we all know this once we sit down and think about it.

- a quick examination of our own lives suggests that kinship relations are not constructed in contractual terms, which terminate if certain conditions are not met. Indeed, the very moment we introduce a legal type of condition into kinship relationships we completely undermine what it means to be in a loving relationship. Kinship relations are utterly different from contractual relationships and it is critical that they remain so. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1956))
- God relates to us as kin, which means that he loves us extravagantly, unconditionally, and irrevocably—again, supposing that kinship is working at its best, not its worst. Our families and friends are meant to love us and God does love us. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1961))
- Love is what it is in large measure because it holds in spite of conditions. It defies conditions. “I will love you for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.” So to construe our relationship with God in terms of conditions like a contract is to fundamentally alter and to undermine it. Indeed, it is to fundamentally alter our picture of God. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1975))
- If God does not relate to us in an unconditional way as in the best sort of family relationship then he is no longer a God of love. The God of contractual relations and the God of kinship relations are just not the same thing; they are not the same God.

- If God only loves us after we fulfill certain conditions and enter the church then God has to be conditioned into loving us in the first place. So even if God does treat us with affection for a time, it is not really proper love. It began from another place after a two-way deal was made. God did not reach out to us and engage with us because he loved us. Moreover, he only loves us while we do certain things, and if we stop or falter then he stops loving us. This “love” will be withdrawn the moment that we slip up and break the conditions of our relationship. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=1987))
- Theologians who structure God’s relationship with us contractually basically admit all this when they characterize God’s deepest nature in terms other than love. So Piper states that God is characterized fundamentally by rightness, glory, and holiness, which he goes on to define in terms of retributive justice. But this is a very different thing from unconditional love. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2000))
- Indeed, it is quite fascinating to note that in his account of JT he mentions the love of God very seldom, and never in a fundamental position. Did we ever have to speak of a God of love as we set out his account of the gospel in terms of JT? We did not. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2003))
- Now justice—and this particular type of justice—is a good thing in its place. But if it is not controlled by Jesus Christ it can be brutally harsh and it can never be called love in any meaningful sense. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2005))
- all of our most important human relationships—the relationships that form us and that we in turn form others through—are not based on retribution. Indeed, it is fairly obvious that our key relationships are not contractual or based on some vague notion of “justice” at all. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2007))
- These critical, formative relationships are covenantal, which is to say, they are loving in the senses that they are strong, secure, and ultimately unbreakable.108 ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2010))
- love enters into covenantal not contractual relationships, and since we know that God loves us, he must be in a covenantal relationship with us. It is then precisely non-contractual and unconditional. God offered up his only beloved Son for us while we were still hostile sinners—when we were completely resistant to and alienated from his loving purposes, and hence refusing to fulfill any conditions, possibly never to do so (Rom 5:6–11). Nevertheless he still loved us extravagantly and unconditionally—enough to die for us—which is what love does. God loves us deeply and permanently in spite of ourselves. ([Location 2013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2013))
- the very idea that God must be conditioned into loving us, as JT suggests, undermines the central revelation that he does love us, along with any gospel that understands and proclaims this. A gospel that proclaims God’s deep love for us only after the fulfillment of key conditions would not be a gospel based on Paul’s deepest insights into God as revealed by Jesus, and it is not the gospel that we Christians should be proclaiming to the world. It would be a gospel unworthy of that name ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2018))

- Justification theory is conditional and contractual from front to back. It specifies conditions for any relationship with God, whether works of law or faith. So it is in fact a contractual approach to salvation and it proclaims a God of retribution. ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2040))
- As a result of this, it necessarily resists the suggestion that God is, at bottom, a God of love, and so, as we have just seen, it must fundamentally redefine love so that it ends up not being love at all. In terms of its very structure then it denies a God of love. ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2042))
- Paul clearly does think, after encountering Jesus, that God loves us and is in a covenantal relationship with us.

- When it comes to the relationship between the 10 percent of Paul’s material that freights JT and the 90 percent that delivers a gospel of resurrectional participation we can now see with absolute clarity that the theological differences between them are irreconcilable. And this is important. It simply will not do in light of this cleavage to claim that they can just be sequenced together like some sort of theological train.

- One reason we use JT rather than “the Lutheran reading of Paul” or something similar is to allow the appropriate nuancing of these relationships in due course. Justification theory is present in Luther, Calvin, and so on, but it by no means dominates their work. Scholars of Luther and Calvin continue to debate the real center of gravity in their thinking, and not usually in terms of JT.

- No one lays out the differences here more clearly than James B. Torrance. In two articles he describes the battle between these two accounts of salvation through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for the soul of Scottish Presbyterianism: see his “Covenant or Contract: A Study of the Theological Background of Worship in Seventeenth-Century Scotland” (1970); and “The Contribution of Mcleod Campbell to Scottish Theology” (1973). Although these essays present as somewhat technical, they are extremely lucid. They can be found as “Appendix A” and “Appendix B” in Tilling (ed.), Beyond Old and New Perspectives on Paul, 261–301. ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2086))
- Advocates of JT, and of a smooth, untroubled justification-sanctification sequence, have a vested interest in not seeing any problems in this arrangement! ([Location 2092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2092))
- Piper himself, however, is in fact deeply inconsistent here; what he gives with one hand in terms of a loving God he immediately takes back with the other hand, by way of the contractual God. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2111))
- In chapter 4 we began to see how JT works and is structured, in two broad phases. It begins with individuals trying to be justified by doing works informed by law, and when that process fails, it continues to another phase if an individual accepts the offer of salvation by faith alone. ([Location 2122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2122))
- Hence the knowledge of God is primarily information. We know things about God rather than knowing him directly and personally. Moreover, the entire thrust of the theory clearly pushes from our own capacity for understanding things, including God, to certain inferences and conclusions about his nature and expectations for humanity. ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2129))
- We work out all the key things about God for ourselves—and we detect an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God of retribution. Theologians denote this type of theology “general revelation” or “natural theology,” and it is doing foundational work here. Indeed, this last point is worth emphasizing. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2132))
- in terms of the model, we cannot understand that solution before we have generated the problem that leads to us grasping for the solution in the first place. So we only learn about Jesus after we have learned a lot of critical things about God and how God relates to us. And there is a very basic sense in which JT works forwards as a model. Natural theology grounds and leads to special revelation. ([Location 2138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2138))
- The gospel we described in the first three chapters of this book, however, which begins with a relationship with God established by God through Jesus, progresses in a very different mode: namely, revelationally. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2146))
- We know God because God has first known us.111 Hence the knowledge of God is “special” from the get-go. It focuses on Jesus and is disclosed by Jesus and the Spirit, both of whom often choose to work through designated followers—people like Paul, along with other preachers in the church. As a result of this, the entire thrust of the model is different, and really runs exactly the other way around, from God to us rather than from us to God. ([Location 2148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2148))
- God gifts correct thoughts about God to us rather than us generating correct thoughts about God. The struggle to think clearly about God—as here in this book—should still happen, but only in dependence on what we got and continue to get from God as that is focused and clarified by Jesus; it responds to a relationship that has been established rather than initiating that relationship. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2152))
- Moreover, this Jesus-centered information about God that is given to us is disclosed as one dimension within a larger saving process that draws us into relationship with God and with one another; this model is corporate and communal, not individual. People enslaved by sinful passions, evil powers, and ultimately by death, are released, healed, and transformed by participating in the loving communion of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And these realities are mediated most clearly—at least ideally—by the church. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2154))
- So the process is fundamentally interpersonal and relational, and ultimately communal, as against purely individual and informational. ([Location 2158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2158))
- In the participatory gospel, it is only after the event of revelation and salvation and in complete dependence on it that we begin to understand with real clarity our own situation, including our sinful pasts. Box B gives us real clarity into the nature of Box A, and not the other way around. ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2162))
- We may have had intimations of wrongdoing before we became Christians—or perhaps we did not—but the definitive insight into our sin is generated retrospectively, in the light of Christ. ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2164))
- So the model “thinks backwards,” understanding the plight of Box A in the light of the solution provided within Box B. The solution, which has been gifted to us, reveals with true clarity our plight. Like substance abusers who are working through a rehab program, the full horrors of addiction and its harmful impact on our lives in the past come slowly into view only as we are on the path to recovery and as part of that path to recovery. ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2167))

- Justification theory works forwards or prospectively. And sin is known immediately, in a foundational position, hence independently of any knowledge of God’s will as that might be revealed by Jesus. It is known from the laws of God inferred from the cosmos and the conscience. The direction, as we noted earlier, is from plight to solution.

- They clash fundamentally in terms of their accounts of the nature of the truth about God—and not just what we learn but where we learn and how.

- JT holds that harm must be visited retributively and proportionately upon those who do harm—something generally achieved by inflicting pain on a body. But in JT the harm due to us is of course visited instead upon Jesus. This is the way that retributive justice supposes that wrongs are righted, and the peculiar way it gets around the problem of our wrongdoing in relation to Jesus to save us. ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2195))
- So Jesus endures a great weight of pain, harm, and judgment as he is tortured by his captors and then dies on the cross, thereby experiencing the punishment that should be falling on sinful humanity. This event technically allows the removal of God’s wrath from sinful humanity, because it has been exhausted by falling on Jesus, although this benefit still needs to be appropriated by faith.

- Justification theory begins with natural revelation and the realizations that every thinking person ought to reach as s/he reflects on “the starry sky without and the moral law within.”117 We are in trouble! It is the realization that we are sinners who have violated the divine decrees and so will shortly be in the hands of an angry God that supposedly motivates us to grasp the offer of salvation by faith in Jesus. ([Location 2243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2243))
- There is a sense then that the gospel must begin with bad news and with the preaching of the law. Only once the bad news has been processed will the good news be accepted. (We once heard this put memorably as “the gospel is offered at gunpoint.”) It follows then that the bad news about our relationship with God is proclaimed first and the good news second—although because the bad news is first and is so basic, the good news is fairly heavily qualified. ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2247))
- Barth had a nice way of putting this, which we have already used once: he would observe that in this version of the gospel God’s “No” to us precedes and frames his “Yes.” ([Location 2250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2250))
- He would then generally add words to the effect that God’s “No” is more fundamental than his “Yes”; the “Yes” is only heard through the “No” and is qualified by the “No.” God’s “No” is spoken “in a very loud voice” and dominates his “Yes.” ([Location 2251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2251))
- Implicit in this model of address, with its essentially rational pressure and its focus on information, the heavy lifting in any evangelism can be done by straightforward proclamation, although proclamation of a certain sort. Evangelists essentially make a speech about all this to anyone who will listen, and at least some listeners—those who are, strictly speaking, appropriately rational and moral—can draw the appropriate conclusions and choose faith and salvation.

- A final useful observation: because the resurrectional model presupposes a relational God drawing us into a deeper relationship with both himself and one another, the emphasis within evangelism is less upon correct information and reasoning about God—although these will play their part—and more upon correct relating. ([Location 2284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2284))
- more informal and conversational than in the more rationalistic, structured, informational preaching of JT. Indeed, communication by evangelists may involve listening as much as it involves declaring. It follows from this, moreover, that there might not be a single important moment of conversion as much as a slow, gradual process, or a zigzag journey with many important moments, although it doesn’t really matter. ([Location 2287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2287))
- This is how the transformational and resurrectional model thinks about evangelism, so “friendship evangelism” can get quite close to this approach. We answer questions about the God revealed through Jesus as and when we are asked them, speaking about Jesus as someone we know (which, hopefully, we do). ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2293))
- And it should be fairly clear by now that these are really two different systems. So we will speak, moving forward, as we have from time to time in what has preceded, of two gospels in Paul (see Gal 1:6–7). In the previous chapter we identified how JT is based on a God of retributive justice and not, like the resurrectional and participatory gospel, on a God of love. Another way of talking about this is in terms of the contrast between a God who acts in terms of contracts as against a God who is covenantal in his dealings with us. ([Location 2300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2300))
- three further differences: ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2304))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- The first difference is the place where the decisive knowledge of God is revealed along with the means by which it is revealed. In JT the individual finds God through a process of rational reflection that happens before they meet Jesus; in the participatory gospel, God reveals himself to the person—who is not viewed or treated as an individual—through Jesus and the work of the divine Spirit. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2305))
- The directionality of the two models is diametrically opposed as well. The progression of understanding in JT works from the plight to the solution, so “forwards” from Box A to Box B. In the participatory model the understanding of the non-Christian situation is generated in the light of Christ, who illuminates its contours clearly, and who clarifies our minds; we look “backwards.” Like a recovering alcoholic, we understand our past more clearly in the light of our present location in Christ. ([Location 2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2309))
- The two models also understand the saving work of Christ in different ways. The emphasis in JT falls almost entirely on Good Friday and the cross, although in some variations of JT, like Piper’s, there is an emphasis on Jesus’s sinless life as well. The participatory gospel also emphasizes Good Friday, but the incarnation that precedes Easter is critical, along with Jesus’s faithful life leading to the cross.

- It is time to turn, that is, to a particular grievous problem set up by JT—the fifth major issue we are identifying at this stage in our description—and to face its awful reality with candor and humility.

- So JT provides answers to the question of the fundamental nature of God (retributive), to God’s key way of relating to humanity (legal and rule-governed), to the structure of the good and of ethics (legal), and thereby to politics (retributive and rule-governed), and to eschatology (legal and retributive again).

- much of the church has long fostered what has become known as a “teaching of contempt” concerning Jews. Centuries of anti-Jewish characterizations can be catalogued from the sermons, exegesis, papal bulls, lectures, pamphlets, and books of church leaders. The Jews are charged there, alone of all people, with “deicide,” namely, with the execution of God. ([Location 2450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2450))
- This othering had a practical bent, however. Jews were forbidden in many Christian states from owning property, and from living anywhere other than in certain urban quarters.

    - **Tags:** #pink
- The texts freighting JT in Paul, which are read in terms of “Box A,” speak frequently of the attempt by certain people to be pronounced righteous through “works of law,” obviously meaning by “works informed by the laws of Moses.” So these figures are Jewish. They possess copies of what we now call the Old Testament, and they have been seeking salvation by trying to keep its rules and regulations perfectly. ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2511))
- these specifically Jewish figures represent humanity in general in the non-Christian state. But everyone who is a non-Christian is really operating like a Jew; it is just that they do not possess written instructions exactly like Jews (as Romans 2 is well aware). Non-Jews infer God’s demands by reflecting with their minds on the cosmos without and with their consciences on the moral law within. Nevertheless, the basic structure of their situation is exactly the same. ([Location 2515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2515))
- in JT, the Jew is the quintessential occupant of Box A. More than this: Jews define the occupant of Box A, so Box A, in turn, necessarily defines the Jew. ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2518))
- First, the basic construction of Judaism must correspond to the basic structure of non-Christian humanity, and this means that there is something very generic about its account of people—technically, about its anthropology. It is the same at all times and in all places. ([Location 2521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2521))
- Hence, the relationship between God and the Jews is constructed legally with a corresponding politics. The entire situation is characterized rather strongly by “law and order.” Wrongdoing is defined by law-breaking and responded to by punishment, which is to say, by the infliction of harm on any law-breakers by some official figure or figures. ([Location 2527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2527))
- It follows in addition that this anthropology and the legally-informed cosmos that frames it will be universal; it can be found everywhere, at all times and in all places. There might be local variations but there will be a basic underlying uniformity. Box A is an account of all of human history apart from Christ—of all people not in the church. But the typical representative figure of unsaved humanity is, as we have just said, a Jew. ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2529))
- To grasp the parameters of Box A, which means here to understand fully what it means to be a Jew, is to learn that this situation should cease to exist. To grasp it clearly—to understand God’s purposes here completely—is to grasp that it should be left behind. The point of Box A is to propel its occupants into Box B, and Box B is Christian. We are not supposed to stay in Box A! ([Location 2535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2535))
- Moreover, Box B is entered through faith in Jesus, and accompanying this dependence on faith alone is a continued repudiation of any attempt to be saved through works. As we saw earlier, this emphasis is critical because any alternative emphasis—any addition to faith—is, in terms of JT, automatically to lapse back into Box A and its futile attempts to be justified by works. ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2539))
- It seems to follow inexorably then—and certainly many proponents of JT do emphasize this—that works of law should cease after salvation, from which emphasis it seems to follow that any Jews who understand fully what their Judaism involves should step out of that structure and into the Christian church, leaving their Judaism behind. Jewish practices are to be abandoned as a failed attempt to be saved; once saved by faith alone, these must not be revived. ([Location 2541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2541))
- People who consciously resist the lessons of Box A fall into the category of being recalcitrant and hence deserve the designation of being especially appalling sinners. They are necessarily irrational and/or immoral, because by resisting the obvious rational and moral lessons of the situation—which lead to Box B—they demonstrate that they are one or both of these undesirable things. ([Location 2550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2550))
- In short then, those who resist salvation and who continue to live in Box A, but who are nevertheless religious—or at least contend that they are—are appropriately described as immoral, irrational, hypocritical, legalistic, and mercantile. But it follows that these negative descriptors apply above all to unconverted Jews. Recalcitrant Jews who resist conversion to Christianity by way of faith alone are, of all people, immoral, irrational, hypocritical, legalistic, and mercantile. ([Location 2560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2560))
- What does JT prescribe for recalcitrant sinners? Again, we know well by now that JT threatens ongoing recalcitrant occupants of Box A with the appropriate retribution on the day of judgment. They will be executed by God as the appropriate punishment for their sins, since these have not had their punishment transferred onto the shoulders of Christ on the cross. ([Location 2565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2565))
- Moreover, in versions of JT like Piper’s, the recalcitrant will stand guilty and condemned for their own personal unrighteousness as God does not view them as clothed in Christ’s perfect righteousness. And… ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2569))

- The cosmos in Box A is constructed primarily in terms of law and order, and transgressors are appropriately punished even there by God’s appointed representatives (and Rom 13:1–7 might be invoked here).132 Moreover, resistance to the offer of forgiveness and righteousness through Christ is a transgression—it is the… ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2573))

The unsaved deserve punishment. A ghastly punishment for them is inevitable, so there are few… ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2578))

Moreover, if they resist this dynamic, then harsh retributive powers are unleashed against them.

- they are destined for retribution on the day of judgment. They will, that is, if they fail to convert, suffer the same fate as the Jews. But we can see at this point that JT has now framed these indigenous non-Christian people in a certain, rather sinister, fashion. ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2602))
- First of all, they have had their own accounts of righteousness and goodness overridden by the missionaries who have framed them in terms of JT. It is the missionaries’ accounts of the right and the good that must be accepted, not the indigenous accounts. There is no need in this model to hear what the indigenous people have to say for themselves. Their accounts of their own situation must necessarily be in error. Now, ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2604))
- JT insists that their accounts of the right and the good are irrelevant and, where different, necessarily inferior. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2609))
- Second, if the indigenous potential converts go on to resist the conclusions of Box A like recalcitrant Jews, they are also framed in retributive terms, by a structure of law and order, and destined for punishment. The non-converting indigenous are criminalized on account of their resistant behavior. ([Location 2610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2610))
- Their conquest is now merited, or, at the least, is unobjectionable, perhaps even if it is accompanied by their enslavement. ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2612))
- JT has a nasty colonizing tendency, and an integrated set of unhealthy dynamics is operative here. ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2615))
- Justification theory frames outsiders irrespective of their own circumstances and narratives; it frames them in terms of assumptions about rightness that are obvious to the advocates of the model. Moreover, those assumptions are not subject to any strong theological control; they are derived by thinking about the cosmos and consulting the inner voice of conscience. A recipe for cultural capture is harder to imagine. ([Location 2616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2616))
- JT advocates tell outsiders what to think. Moreover, if outsiders resist that instruction, they will be categorized by that very act of resistance as inferior. They are operating with some debased notion of rightness and hence are immoral; and/or they are resisting the obvious logic of the situation, so they are stupid. ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2618))
- the appropriate response to this foolishness is coercive. These inadequate responses to the overtures of JT are transgressions, which is to say, offences and felonies, and the appropriate response to felonies prescribed by JT is retribution. ([Location 2621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2621))
- Christians operating in terms of JT are basically trained to strongly other non-Christians, viewing them as morally inferior, and happily subjecting them to coercive actions if they resist. ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2624))

- is very easy to see the way that JT could both generate and reinforce Christian colonialism and authoritarianism (and an especially toxic dynamic will be unleashed when these tendencies intersect with racial, gender, and/or class differences). ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2627))
- Some scholars of race have argued perceptively that the mistreatment of Jews is intrinsically connected to the mistreatment by many Christians of other minority populations like Black or Indigenous American groups; anti-Jewishness they suggest is a litmus test for the presence of a sinister othering program that is operating with theological cover, as the will of God. ([Location 2633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2633))
- Justification theory strongly others the Jews, framing them ultimately in inferior and criminalized terms. And, as if this was not bad enough, this framing applies necessarily to every other non-Christian group as well, not to mention, to Christian groups who are regarded as misguided or deviant. ([Location 2637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2637))
- The parameters of Box A teach people about sin, explain the cross, undergird the construction of the cosmos in terms of law and order and, most importantly of all, propel non-Christians to reach out with a real sense of urgency and dread to become Christians, saved by faith alone. But this pressure is achieved by defining non-Christians essentially as cosmic felons—by criminalizing them. And this characterization applies above all to recalcitrant Jews. ([Location 2644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2644))
- Jewish resistance to these definitions—to the conclusions that they are religious felons who should leave their Jewishness behind—only confirms the “truth” of these conclusions more strongly. ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2651))
- we must now also mark well both that this negative construction applies in the first instance and hence above-all to Jews, and that the entirety of Christian salvation rests upon it, so it is not negotiable, and this last realization is absolutely critical. ([Location 2654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2654))
- The identity of the Christian when it is defined in terms of JT—and this is really the nub of the issue—rests on this powerful, initial, negative, othering operation. ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2659))
- the account of the gospel offered by JT—of its Christian claims and truths—is based completely and directly on this prior negative account of outsiders in terms of Jews. ([Location 2661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2661))
- The Christian, in order to remain a Christian in these terms, must define the Jew as a cosmic felon destined for divine execution. So JT only works, we might say, if the Jews remain on death row. ([Location 2663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2663))
- Justification theory is deeply involved in the teaching of contempt (and hence, albeit indirectly, at many removes, but nevertheless indelibly, in the final solution). And the right response to these realizations is repentance, so here, as we read Paul, to interpretative repentance. We need to turn away from a model that has caused this much harm and damage in the name of the gospel, and to endorse another way if that is possible. ([Location 2668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2668))
- Justification theory occurs primarily (and ostensibly!) in Rom 1:16—5:1; and Rom 10; and in Gal 2:15—3:26; with possible short summaries elsewhere, for example in Gal 5:5–6; Eph 2:8–10; and Phil 3:6 and 9. ([Location 2678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2678))

- Groups who are experiencing various types of marginalization will be defined by JT in meritorious terms, hence as guilty of their own misfortune and so justly liable to any existing inequalities and to any coercive consequences.

- He then sets this self-description over against what he sees going on principally in Paul—the 90 percent of the apostle’s texts that speak of what we have tended to call “participatory” and “resurrectional.” Sanders helpfully dubbed this material “participationist eschatology.” ([Location 2736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2736))

([Location 2742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2742))
- Sanders judged that all the texts, with just one or two exceptions,137 articulated the same basic underlying story of God’s relationship with the Jews. Moreover, and most importantly, this story was not a mercantile, legalistic story—a story of repeated attempts to be proved righteous by doing the works prescribed by the law thereby somehow earning salvation from God. ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2745))
- It was a very different story, which he named “covenantal nomism.” ([Location 2749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2749))
- “Covenantal” names the fact that the vast majority of these Jewish texts ascribe the relationship of the Jews with God to God’s initiative. God called them and summoned them into being just as he called creation into existence in the first place, as explained by Genesis 1.

- The relationship between God and the Jews is a covenant, like a marriage, and is consequently constructed more in terms of kinship than in terms of legality. God loves Israel and protects it as mothers and fathers brood over their children and partners love and covenant with their spouses. ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2754))
- (Marginally less intimately, God also acts here like a benevolent monarch who loves his people deeply and so nurtures, sustains, and, if necessary, delivers them.) ([Location 2756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2756))
- what Christians call the OT and Jews the Tanakh was the Bible of Paul’s day—the Scripture—and so Jews like Paul were devoted to it, learned from it, treasured it, and venerated it. It is consequently best not referred to as “law” but rather as “sacred teachings,” “Scripture,” or something similar. ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2764))
- Sanders described the expected response God prescribed in those teachings for Israel as “nomism.” The Greek word often translated “law” in Paul is nomos. So Sanders is deliberately nuancing the translation of this word here in a different direction from JT to denote the response informed by Scripture that God expects from his people, the Jews. ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2768))
- They are to live their lives guided by the instructions found in their nomos. Hence, they participate in a nomism, not in a legalism. They are operating within a nomistic or Torah-guided response, and this response is located within a secure and loving covenantal arrangement. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2771))
- They are not engaged in a legalistic relationship based on a reading of the Scripture as a law with certain stipulated conditions that must be fulfilled lest an essentially retributive God turn away and abandon them, having punished them as they deserved. ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2773))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- Whereas JT, by way of contrast, defines Jews rationalistically, individually, and very generically—the same across time and space—Sanders saw a corporate identity that travelled through history. Moreover, the Jews were whole people, so to speak, who responded to God with study (i.e., rationality) but also with devotion and piety (i.e., with prayer), with fidelity, and with emotion and commitment. ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2777))
- the Jews were aware that God accepted various practices that dealt with sin, beyond the temple’s specific removal of unintentional sin with the sin and guilt offerings, and the offering of appropriate compensation139 (and some of these received further emphasis after the destruction of the temple by the Romans in 70 CE). ([Location 2801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2801))
- Suffering could be accepted by God as a way of dealing with sin. Moreover, some Jewish texts argued that vicarious suffering by Jewish heroes or martyrs could function to cleanse the sins of other people.140 The story recounted by Genesis 22 of Abraham’s (near) sacrifice of Isaac rose to special prominence in this relation, being viewed by many Jews as a definitive event that locked the Jews into relationship with God in perpetuity. ([Location 2805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2805))
- like manner, alms-giving could be accepted by God as an appropriate response that maintained the covenant. The great generosity encouraged among Jews is exemplified in the charming story of Tobit, who gives money freely to his Jewish kin, although especially to the poor, and who even stops unbidden to bury a Jew who has died on the street—presumably no mean effort in the baked earth of the Mesopotamian plain. ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2811))
- However, perhaps most importantly Sanders noted the constant refrain in the Jewish texts that pointed simply to deep repentance and/or to accompanying requests to God for forgiveness as means of dealing with sin and maintaining the covenant relationship. ([Location 2816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2816))
- The view that God was loving and committed to his people and hence willing to forgive them like a parent persisted deep into Paul’s day. The pseudepigraphic Prayer of Manasseh speaks eloquently of God’s compassion and forgiveness as this infamous sinner throws himself onto God’s mercy (citing here the shortened version used in the Book of Common Prayer): ([Location 2821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2821))
- The covenant would hold and the Jews, in spite of any sin, would be forgiven—after which they would redouble their efforts to live as God’s people informed by their precious Scriptures. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2862))
- Did God “judge” the Jews? Of course! But this was a parental judgment, the sources attest—harsh, potentially yes, like many acts of discipline in ancient societies, but ultimately restorative. It was an exercise in discipline and not an utter repudiation or destruction that could be visited by God on sinful outsiders. ([Location 2863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2863))
- could the covenant itself be annulled? This was a much more important question and the answer was, “Emphatically not!” If this were to happen, the implications for God were simply unthinkable, whether in terms of his power or his commitments. The covenant could never bend to the point that it was broken so that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ceased to be the God of their children and of their more distant descendants. God’s loving choice and election of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—and of Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, and Rachel—could never be undone. ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2873))
- this is what Paul himself, a Jew, states quite clearly in Romans 9:6–13, and 11:28–29. The God who ceased to love and to be in relationship with the children of Abraham and Sarah was a God who had abandoned Abraham and Sarah and his commitments to them, and this was impossible. ([Location 2877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2877))
- Sanders set himself a massive challenge—to reverse centuries of false definition (by Christian scholars) of Jews as legalists. In his zeal, he argued much the converse: all Jews, with very minor exceptions, only attest to a warm-hearted covenantal nomism. Legalism is nowhere in sight. He also backed up his claims made in ([Location 2884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2884))
- It is as unlikely that all Jews in Paul’s day, with one or two exceptions, were compassionate covenantal nomists, as that they were all mercantile, narrow-minded legalists. They were probably, like any religion or ethnic group—not to mention, like the church—a mixed bag. ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2889))
- The Jewish people as they existed in Paul’s day were a complex, variegated entity. ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2894))
- they did not lack coherent definition altogether. They were recognizable as an ethnic group. Many outsiders would speak of them in typically racist but recognizable ways suggesting that Romans and Greeks had a fair idea about the existence of a people called the Jews, as well as of some of their key practices. ([Location 2895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2895))
- It is fair to suggest then that Jews, despite their differences, possessed a “family resemblance.” Moreover, that resemblance undoubtedly had a relationship with a key underlying family of narratives; all ethnicities do. ([Location 2898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2898))
- it is entirely fair to affirm that “covenantal nomism” describes, at the very least, a significant proportion of Jews in Paul’s day. This is how they understood God, the world, and their special relationship with God, and that story interwove with various other key practices—prayer, almsgiving, support for the temple, dietary and calendrical observances, endogamy, and so on. ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2900))
- A significant proportion of Jews in Paul’s day were not “legalists” (although some were); they were covenantal nomists of one sort or another. And this must have an impact on how we read Paul’s arguments that discuss Jews, and especially when JT is in play. ([Location 2907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2907))
- The judgment’s ground for us lies ultimately in the God revealed by Jesus Christ who is compassionate, unconditional, and covenantal. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2917))
- Furthermore, in the light of this covenant we also frequently learn that we are deeply fallible and broken agents, and so need a saving arrangement that rescues, liberates, and transforms us, rather than asking us to bring a lot to that arrangement in and of ourselves (and note the order of education in this sequence carefully; in the light of God’s gracious action we learn about our sinfulness, and not vice versa). ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2918))
- It is better to have a compassionate God in view: this is what God is really like; and this way of relating ultimately resonates with and operates through our most important human relationships, which are familial relationships, working at their best, or friendships that work in the same way. It is good and right that these relationships too function as covenants, not contracts. So we endorse the value judgment operative in Sanders’s characterizations, ([Location 2921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2921))
- we can see at this moment just why Sanders poses such a difficult problem for JT. It is just supposed to be obvious that all Jews are legalists and, as such, that they thereby represent Everyman, and the further unfolding of the gospel progression depends on this starting point along with its eventual failure. And Sanders asserted with overpowering documentation and clarity that this description is not true. Jews were not legalists. They were, in the main, something quite different, namely, covenantal nomists. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2940))
- The opening definition of this model—the key claims that get the whole theory going, which are focused on a particular definition of Jews—are false, at least for much of the time. Justification theory is based on a lie. ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2947))
- Sanders basically reaffirmed the famous thesis of Albert Schweitzer which had been asserted many years earlier in 1930 when that immensely famous scholar published his epochal book on Paul, The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle. ([Location 2958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2958))
- Schweitzer was an early—and remains a singularly insightful—proponent of the view that the 90 percent of material in Paul that we have described here in chapters 1 through 3 (the participatory and resurrectional gospel) is the heart of Paul’s thinking about God. ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2959))
- Although Sanders was not the first to point to the unfairness of a legalistic characterization of Jews, he made the case for their kinder, gentler definition in especially powerful terms and at an especially propitious moment.145 The 1970s was a great decade to be championing the cause of a previously-voiceless and marginalized minority, and to be doing so, moreover, as the full horrors of the Holocaust were emerging steadily into view. ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2974))
- we think that the solution offered by the NPP is inadequate. In particular, it has not grasped the underlying problem in Paul’s texts and their legalistic interpretation with sufficient clarity and depth. There is a sense in which the NPP is deeply superficial. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=2987))
- More important than the origin of the name, however, is the ongoing realization that the NPP is a response to the NPJ; they are not the same thing. The NPP attempts to reinterpret Paul in a way that takes both the post-Holocaust concerns and the descriptive claims of the NPJ on board successfully. ([Location 3040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3040))
- it is a rereading project, and it ends up concentrating largely on the material in Paul that freights JT, since this is where the legalistic description of Jews largely lies. Consequently the NPP characteristically addresses Pauline motifs like “works of law,” “justification,” and “faith.” Can Paul’s descriptions of Jews in the texts usually read in terms of JT be read in a way that aligns him with covenantal nomism, not with legalism? ([Location 3042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3042))
- Justification theory suggests that the inhabitants of Box A, who are prototypically Jewish, are attempting to be justified before God by doing works of law (Rom 2:6–10), a task that fails, opening up the way to faith. So the Jews as described there are supposed to be legalists. ([Location 3054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3054))
- Dunn’s central claim, in response to this challenge, was that the phrase “works of law” should not be read as referring to “legalism,” but as referring to “sociological boundary markers,” and that this solves our problems. ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3056))
- Dunn was well aware of this. So he went on to develop a covenantal account of Jewish sinfulness over against the usual legalistic account. ([Location 3064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3064))
- Hence, he opined, rather ingeniously, that the phrase “works of law” had something to do with Jewish ethnicity and went on to argue that the problem Paul detected in the Jews resulted from Israel’s privileged position vis-à-vis God as covenantal nomists. Something went wrong in this arrangement. ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3065))
- Paul was unhappy not with Jewish legalism then—a JT misreading—but with the exclusivism or the pride, the ethnocentrism, which resulted from being a covenantal nomist! Covenantal nomism had a dark side. ([Location 3067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3067))
- The result was that these important “works of law” functioned sociologically as “boundary markers” (whereas JT views these works strictly individualistically and ethically). So Dunn speaks of “works of law” as “an identity factor, the social function of the law marking out the people of the law in their distinctiveness (circumcision, food laws, etc.),” creating the Jews’ “religious and national peculiarities.” ([Location 3079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3079))
- Boundary markers, whatever they were, just had to go as boundary markers, so that everyone, from every ethnicity, could enter the church and be saved. Israel needed to be replaced by something less particular and more universal. We could call this Issue II. ([Location 3101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3101))
- Whatever the exact problem, whether in terms of Issue I or II, hoarding or distinctiveness, the Jews had begun to treat their special identifying practices in some deeply inappropriate way that othered the pagans too much for Paul’s tastes, and he is ostensibly attacking them for doing this in Box A, ([Location 3104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3104))
- Paul only elaborates on “works of law” once, in the opening chapters of Romans. Elsewhere the phrase occurs largely undefined and undeveloped. So his audiences clearly knew what it was already and just needed to supply that definition when they were reading his abbreviated instructions. ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3122))
- However, in Rome, apparently, his audience did not have this prior information. So how does Paul explain the phrase “works of law” there? The answer, in a word, is “legalism.” The phrase refers to a process whereby a person works their way to salvation. These works are informed by the Jewish Torah, which is indeed therefore functioning in this passage like a law. ([Location 3124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3124))
- Romans then finishes with a set of short summarizing statements in 3:19–20 which emphasize the difficult side of this legalism: verse 20 states, again quoting Scripture (Ps 143:2), that “all flesh will not be declared innocent before him through works of law” (our translation). But the same basic legalistic scenario is plainly in view. ([Location 3148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3148))
- The phrase “works of law” will resist any redefinition away from legalism by later re-interpreters because when Paul explains what he means with this phrase, in Romans 2, he clearly means something legalistic. ([Location 3155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3155))
- Here the Jews in Box A “hoard” their precious practices and refuse to share them, resisting a missionary movement into the surrounding nations, thereby becoming guilty to charges of ethnocentric pride, arrogance, and selfishness. We might say—cautiously—that they have been miserly with their Jewishness, at which moment we see immediately that we are still on very dangerous ground. But addressing the logical issue, we can also see fairly quickly that Dunn has just run into a major problem. ([Location 3206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3206))
- The appropriate response to a charge of inappropriate hoarding of Jewish practices would be an open-handed and generous sharing of those practices with anyone who wanted to adopt them. The answer to hoarding is Jewish missionary work qua Jews. “Convert to Judaism and be saved!” This is the journey that now unfolds from this account of the problem in Box A. Hence, we have clearly not arrived at salvation by faith alone and neither can we. ([Location 3210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3210))
- someone gets saved by faith alone, then any ethnicity (Jewish or non-Jewish) can be coupled with that, at least to some degree. So the church seems to be filled with all sorts of different peoples who live quite distinct lives in people groups with different languages, countries, customs, and so on. The church is more universal than any one of these groups, saved by faith alone. So Dunn seems to be on to something here. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3225))
- note that the terms of Dunn’s argument—and presumably of his account of Paul’s texts—have moved in a very important way. It is just wrong to be a Jew because that is ethnic and God wants the church to be universal. 2.But it seems odd for ethnicity per se to be accused by Paul of being deeply wrong. ([Location 3236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3236))
- No one can exist except within an ethnic group. Humanity is simply constructed in this way, with variations in terms of language, dress, food, calender, flora and fauna, aesthetics, domestic architecture, humor, entertainment practices, sport, rituals, and so on. Is all this wrong simply because it exists with all these variations? ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3239))
- Accusing someone of being ethnic seems to be like accusing someone of breathing or eating or wearing clothes. What else are we going to do? It would seem to be an indelible part of being human. ([Location 3242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3242))
- There is also a worrying dishonesty present within any program that supposes that Christians live in a universal church that lies beyond ethnicity. No Christian lives in a non-ethnic way either. No Christian is asked to repent of their ethnicity per se. They might need to reform its sinful aspects, and to accord it less value than they do; it is not sacred. But nowhere is anyone asked to abandoned ethnicity itself as sinful, and for the reasons we just noted, we can’t. ([Location 3254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3254))
- if we nevertheless think that we do live beyond ethnicity, we have just created a recipe for the cultural erasure of other less powerful people groups and for the imposition of our own ethnicity, unseen, upon them. Christians who think they are living in a universal church, beyond ethnicity, have not abandoned theirs; but that ethnicity is now the universal church that others must adopt. We have turned Christianity into a colonizing program. ([Location 3259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3259))
- JT’s construction of the Jew is odd. Justification theory’s account of the Jew in Box A creates a generic individual figure who operates in terms of strict rationality and philosophically driven morality. So he does not change through time and space. And this is simply not what the Jews were like. They were a people, with a distinctive sociological profile that waxed and waned under the pressure of historical forces, especially from aggressive paganism. They did change. And ([Location 3285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3285))
- As he writes in the opening chapter of his book Justification, “The theological equivalent of supposing that the sun goes round the earth is the belief that the whole of Christian truth is all about me and my salvation.”152 (Wright is directly criticizing Piper’s account of JT with this comment.) ([Location 3352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3352))
- Wright is clearly putting his finger here on one of the problems with JT that we have had cause to note fairly frequently earlier: it is strangely focused on the journey of an individual. The individual in question, moreover, tends to be a highly rational, moral, and self-interested figure who is both universal and yet also specifically Jewish. Wright just knows in his bones that there is something off here. ([Location 3361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3361))
- As we just saw, JT produces a strangely ahistorical, individual Jew who does not vary through time and space. So Wright reinterprets this depiction in historical and corporate terms. Paul speaks of all Jews, hence of Israel, and not of a generic, individual Jew. In tandem with this, instead of the rather philosophical progression of an individual from an unsaved situation toward faith, Box A is now the great journey of Israel that runs right through the Old Testament, from Abraham—and in fact, from the garden of Eden—to the coming of Jesus. ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3369))
- Moreover, since we are now following an entire people journeying through history, Wright can incorporate sociological dimensions into his analysis as well—the impact on the shape and identity of God’s people imparted by their distinctive ethnic practices like circumcision, endogamy, a special diet and calendar, a special temple in a special city, and so on. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3373))
- Someone could object at this moment that the Jewish leadership did return from exile, rather miraculously, establishing a small but long-lasting state back in Judea—“Second Temple Judaism.”156 But Wright integrates this epoch into his broader schema by arguing that the exile never really ended.157 God’s absence from the temple continued to be felt by the Jews in Judea, he suggests, right up to Jesus’s day. ([Location 3407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3407))
- Israel’s Messiah bears Israel’s sin, condemnation, and the “juridical punishment” previously directed at Israel because of its disobedience. God, in turn, declares “those ‘in the Messiah’, with his death and resurrection ‘reckoned’ to them, [as] the single forgiven family promised by the covenant God to Abraham” (964). Consequently, atonement has several dimensions suggests Wright, from representation to substitution to divine victory, all of which operate to remove those “in the Messiah” from exile and God’s wrath. ([Location 3422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3422))
- “Justification” denotes both a “forensic verdict” of acquittal from previous transgressions and a “covenantal declaration” of inclusion in the last Israel that Jesus has realized for Christians. And this last event fulfills God’s original promise to Abraham that he would be the father “of many nations” (937). ([Location 3426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3426))
- Wright proceeds to argue that in Paul’s theology we can find a large-scale retelling of the exodus narrative as the apostle elaborates on this salvation—what Wright calls “the new-exodus” (658). This event functions as the typically panoramic transition of a people from Box A to Box B. ([Location 3429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3429))
- After referencing the post-exilic hope represented in Isaiah, Zechariah, and Malachi (to name just a few of the key texts), which conceive of YHWH eventually returning to the temple, Wright even goes so far as to suggest that Paul views Jesus as the one who brings together the narratives of exodus, redemption, tabernacle, divine presence, God’s return, wisdom, and kingship, in a new-exodus as foretold by the prophets (655). ([Location 3432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3432))
- Wright claims that now “Pistis [i.e., the Greek for faith] is . . . the Israel-characteristic which, according to Romans 3.2 and 3.22, was lacking in Israel itself and provided by the Messiah. Pistis is the appropriate sign that a human being is a Messiah-person, ‘in the Messiah’, ‘belonging to the Messiah’ . . .” (931). But Wright provides an additional rationale that Dunn resisted for the view that the new people of God is characterized by the badge of faith. Jesus himself is spoken of several times by Paul as being the faithful One, says Wright, and he thereby reveals the covenant faithfulness of God. ([Location 3449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3449))
- Wright is clear that once God’s solution arrives in the Messiah those who become a part of this people through faith are shorn of “the symbolic praxis either of Judaism or of paganism” (729; see also 400, 444–45). Its practices are left behind, resulting in a unified community with a new corporate identity and a new worldview. A Spirit-circumcised community now awaits Christ’s return (1258), its bodily resurrection (1093f.), and its final judgment (840). ([Location 3456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3456))
- In the meantime, having been justified, Christians work out their sanctification so that they will receive some reward for their virtue on the great final day—at which moment Wright’s analysis is clearly visited by the shade of Melanchthon (see 957; 978).166 ([Location 3461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3461))
- When Wright boldly narrates Paul’s gospel on a broad narrative canvas, instead of in terms that are individualistic, rationalistic, and timeless, he gives his reader a way of speaking about the Bible as a whole by demonstrating its integrated history in relation to the Jewish people—and most of the time the Bible does talk about the Jews as they worked their way through history. ([Location 3468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3468))
- constrained them in Box A into a life of inheritance in Box B. And the New Testament seems now to fit neatly onto the concerns and dynamics of the Old, snapping in place like the final pieces of Lego needed to complete a model. Small wonder then that Wright’s viewpoint—ably complemented by his eloquence—has gathered such a following, and there is much to applaud in this impact.

- like Wright, we want the Bible to hang together and the Jews to have a key role within God’s purposes within history. But we are also concerned by the sort of God Paul is thought to be proclaiming within all this scriptural material, along with the dynamics whereby we know this God, and what God’s work accomplished through Jesus and through his Spirit exactly does. ([Location 3478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3478))
- we are also deeply concerned about how our construction of Paul describes Jews, and not just how the Jews traveled through history when the Bible speaks of them, back in the OT. For us the Jews are not primarily an interpretative cipher preparing the way in the Scriptures for Christianity. They are a people living in relation to Christians whom we must think carefully about relating to today. ([Location 3482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3482))
- we just need to grasp that this is what Wright has done. Certainly JT has been greatly expanded—extended and projected onto a huge biblical screen. The problem that JT sees facing the generic individual in Box A is now the problem that faces the Jewish people as a whole. The generic struggle to observe the demands of the law, which elicits God’s wrath after its inevitable failure, is now the struggle of the Jewish people through its history to be obedient to God. ([Location 3488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3488))
- this broader story basically still elicits repeated episodes of disobedience and punishment culminating in exile. And this is all still basically Box A. It is just Box A writ large, after which we realize that Box B in Wright, which describes the new community, is just Box B in JT writ large as well. Basically, everything has just gotten a lot bigger. ([Location 3492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3492))
- Wright’s dramatic reinterpretation of Box B in terms of a new exodus still offers the solution to the conundrums of Box A that JT prescribes by way of Jesus’s work on the cross, and still prescribes its reception through the badge of faith. ([Location 3501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3501))
- The traditional version of JT prescribed faith as the condition for membership in the church. And so very little here has changed as well. Moreover—and most significantly—since the community’s “badge” is faith, the church is a community that acts beyond Jewish practices. Hence, Judaism and its practices are again erased, just like in JT. ([Location 3504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3504))
- It seems, when all is said and done, that Wright’s new perspective is really just JT rearranged in broader corporate and historical terms. ([Location 3508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3508))
- this reading does not exactly jump off the pages of the epistles, which is to say that Paul never really says this directly. And Wright knows this. So he claims frequently that Paul presupposes a narrative about Israel, which we learn about by reading all the background texts written by Jews during late Second Temple Judaism. We should assume the operation of this Jewish narrative within Paul even when it is not explicitly stated because (supposedly) all Jews just thought this way, and Paul was a good Jew. ([Location 3516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3516))
- for Wright, intertextuality is in play pretty much everywhere in Paul in a maximal sense. A mere verbal gesture on Paul’s part allows an entire intertextual locomotive to steam into his thinking. ([Location 3524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3524))
- Romans 1–3 is an ahistorical stretch of text that begins with rational individuals knowing God by searching the cosmos, who then look inward in some sense and realize that because of their disobedience to God’s expectations his retributive wrath is upon them. This is clearly what the text is talking about, at least in some sense. ([Location 3535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3535))
- No account of the Jewish problem in terms of boundary markers, whether as selfishly hoarded or simply as boundary markers per se (“Jewish praxis”), can unfold logically into salvation by faith. The solution to selfishly-hoarded boundary markers is to share them; the solution to the possession of boundary markers per se as a construction of ethnicity is the erasure of ethnicity, which seems unrealistic if not shocking, and is ultimately hypocritical. ([Location 3567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3567))
- Wright places Israel centrally to a story about a people who no longer exist; they serve a historical reconstruction of the central subject of the Old Testament, generated to aid the exegesis of the New. It is not an orientation to the Jews themselves as they live and worship in Paul’s day, as well as in ours. So the Jews in Wright’s system function as a scriptural motif—and a negative one at that—and not primarily as the Jewish people themselves. They primarily serve a scriptural and canonical concern as against a concern with our appropriate relationship with a living people whom the church has horribly abused for much of its history. ([Location 3603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3603))
- Wright has long championed an understanding of Jesus Christ as “Jesus Messiah,” and we view this advocacy as both correct and somewhat prophetic. Other scholars are only now beginning to recognize the data that confirms this judgment and its importance. Jesus was the Messiah for Paul, “Messiah” functioning as an honorific rather than either a title or a name. ([Location 3622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3622))
- we can now affirm confidently, with Wright, that this category really mattered for Paul—although just what it entailed is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, in what follows, tutored by Wright and others, we will continue to recognize the importance of Jesus’s messiahship by frequently speaking of “Jesus Messiah” or “Messiah Jesus,” as he would have been known by his Jewish followers. ([Location 3626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3626))
- Piper holds to the particular classical view of JT that not only is the punishment due to the sinner for their sins imputed or credited to Jesus on the cross, but Jesus’s perfect righteousness is credited to the sinner. So imputation or crediting runs in two directions. ([Location 3633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3633))
- Wright, like most modern scholars, finds the exegetical basis for the second type of crediting spoken of here—of Christ’s righteousness to the sinner—to be implausible. (Amongst other things, Romans 2 gives no suggestion that such a system is in play; the judgment there simply affirms or denies the actual ethical worth and activity of the person in view, whether righteous or evil. A legal fiction and crediting of Jesus’s righteousness to a sinful person are simply not in sight.) ([Location 3635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3635))
- We regard the exegesis and arguments underlying Wright’s critique of the traditional, rather mechanical view of imputation language in Paul as correct.173 Furthermore, this is another problem for JT that we will need to keep in mind moving forward. Its reliance on a notion of “imputed righteousness” is unsupportable. ([Location 3645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3645))
- The faithfulness of Jesus consequently speaks of the faithfulness of God to his people, and of the answering faithfulness he expects from his followers in return. Hence, Jesus’s fidelity, displayed above all in his obedient walk to death on a cross, fits neatly into Wright’s panoramic, historical viewpoint, and he endorses this reading firmly. ([Location 3665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3665))
- We strongly affirm this judgment and will consider its implications carefully in what follows. ([Location 3668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3668))
- we affirm Wright’s deepest instincts that, on the one hand, there is something badly off about any account of “the Jew,” like that proposed by JT, which supposes the Jews can be detached from their existence through history as a people. Wright is entirely correct to affirm that “the Jew” is not a single, rational individual who holds constant in his legalism, through time and space. ([Location 3674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3674))
- This is not the Jew of the Bible! There we read only of the Jews, who journey with God through history as a people, complete with special practices, lands, disobedience, obedience, failure, success, triumph, and humiliation. Any reading of Paul that cannot account for this basic biblical viewpoint has to be wrong, ([Location 3676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3676))
- It is certainly fair to see these broader parameters in operation in Romans 9–11, as he does, but that stretch of texts is not the primary locus for JT. We affirm Wright’s basic claims here in the strongest possible terms. ([Location 3679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3679))
- the church’s “teaching of contempt” in relation to Jews—the recollection that for centuries many Christians have described Jews in deeply prejudicial terms, intertwining that rhetoric with harshly exclusive and frequently violent actions against them. For millennia Christian cultures have forced Jews to live in their own quarters within their villages and cities, characterized them with disgust and shame, looted and vandalized their shops and homes, and periodically gone on to butcher their inhabitants. ([Location 3803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3803))
- Sanders himself did not offer any satisfactory solutions to the problem he posed, although, following in the footsteps of Albert Schweitzer, he strongly endorsed what we have called Paul’s transformational and resurrectional gospel. Like us, he saw clearly that this participatory gospel was definitely what mattered most for Paul. ([Location 3814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3814))
- Why do Paul’s texts often seem to describe “the Jew” as monolithically legalistic? The Jews were not all the same and yet Paul seems to suggest in Box A that they were. And why describe Jews at their worst? Why not include some description of their better representatives? Paul’s approach seems both unfairly stereotyped and negative and hence really rather racist, and this when Paul himself was a Jew. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3825))
- In particular, the struggle to free Paul’s interpretation from a legalistic construction of “the Jew” tended to founder on Romans 2, which addresses a Jew and yet is unavoidably legalistic. The defenders of JT won this particular debate, and it is a key piece of textual territory to hold. Legalism just cannot be defined out of this text, and it clearly has something to do with a Jew. ([Location 3837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3837))
- The instinct that when speaking of “the Jew/s” Paul sometimes speaks in sweeping corporate, historical terms, as he does in texts like Romans 9–11, seemed to be profoundly correct. ([Location 3846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3846))
- Wright went still further than Dunn, tweaking Paul’s Box B texts in a more Christo-centric direction. There he saw Paul speaking of Jesus as Israel’s Messiah, not infrequently also mentioning Jesus’s great faithfulness as he walked obediently to a shameful death on a cross as suggested by texts like Philippians 2:6–8. ([Location 3848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3848))
- Paul’s justification texts are being read in terms of justification theory. And it is the construal of Paul’s JT texts in terms of this theory of salvation that generates the Jewish problem, as well as the broader problem of conceptual contradiction. The problem is bad theology from the get-go. ([Location 3872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3872))
- This model of salvation—JT, foundationalist, and forward-working—is permanently and irrevocably committed to the initial definition of “the Jew” in terms that are self-evidently legalistic because only this harsh definition can launch the individual’s journey to salvation by faith alone. Hence, the definition of the Christian in JT, in terms of faith, depends on the prior negative definition of the Jew. ([Location 3883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3883))
- In essence, any account of the Christian gospel in terms of JT arises entirely out of a prior, self-evident definition of a Jew who is necessarily under violent judgment for his immoral and irrational recalcitrance, at which moment we are clearly in touch with one of the most deadly tributaries for the teaching of contempt. The definition of the Christian (in these terms) rests on the prior negative definition (in these terms) of the Jew. ([Location 3890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3890))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- as long as JT remains, the Jewish problem remains, and Paul’s texts, and his gospel, contain the teaching of contempt. ([Location 3895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3895))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- The text of Romans 2 is overtly committed to legalism, just as JT says. The Jewish figure in view here is tangled up with some attempt to be declared righteous by God after doing works of law assiduously (although Romans 2 is followed by Romans 3, which asserts from verse 10 onward that no one is righteous and can actually do this, which creates a further puzzle). ([Location 3908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3908))
- The raft of tensions here is automatically expunged because it is the presence of JT that causes these tensions, working in terms of rational and self-evident truth, individualism, and forward, when everywhere else Paul depends on revelation, community, and a retrospective account of the past. ([Location 3926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3926))
- Clearly many Christians are deeply committed to JT as the account of the gospel and defend it vigorously if they feel that they have to. In particular, the model’s Protestant advocates often trace its church-historical roots back to key leaders in the Reformation and so to the very foundation and identity of their denominations, and they write and read accordingly. ([Location 3940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3940))
- Paul’s gospel, our earlier discussions suggested, is found clearly stated in 90 percent of what he wrote where he speaks of our transformation through the risen Christ. It is our participation in Jesus’s death and resurrection by way of the divine Spirit that transforms us—in part now, and in full in the future. And this is Paul’s gospel, which is to say, the good news that he proclaims. ([Location 3964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3964))
- Its central truths are enacted in the ritual of baptism, which originally was a full immersion into cleansing water and so signifies nicely our death, burial, and rising, within Christ. ([Location 3967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3967))
- Moreover, this is a covenantal gospel because at its heart is a God who offers up an only child on our behalf to be crucified while we were yet sinners, showing us thereby that he loves us in spite of all our foolishness and hostility. The God proclaimed by this gospel will reach out to us unfailingly and hold on to us irrevocably. ([Location 3968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3968))
- JT really offers another gospel, a contractual gospel, which has a different account of God nestling at its heart—a God not of love but of retributive justice. Indeed, it is really no “gospel” at all. And ([Location 3971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3971))
- The emphasis in the transformational gospel was on the entirety of Easter—Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—and included important emphases before and after Easter on the incarnation and the ascension. ([Location 3974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3974))
- The contractual gospel, by way of contrast, is tightly focused on Good Friday, when Jesus died on the cross, ostensibly to pay the penalty for our sins. So it struggled to generate a saving role for the resurrection and ascension, along with any real need for the other key moments in Jesus’s life like the incarnation. ([Location 3976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3976))
- it might be helpful at this point if we signal our solution in a brief way initially by engaging with a short text in Paul—Galatians 2:15–16. ([Location 3980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3980))
- Galatians 2:15–16 is a useful text for us to focus on for the moment because it lays out all the critical words, moves, and issues, in brief. We can reconsider here its interpretation, self-consciously resisting any unnecessary influence from JT, at which moment a rather new understanding emerges. And after the basic moves within this possible solution are clear, we can then turn to a more detailed exposition of the other JT texts, especially in Romans, to see if it is sustainable through the main texts that undergird ([Location 3985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=3985))
- We can see these expectations at work in the translation we just quoted, because the translators of the NIV are deeply convinced that JT is Paul’s gospel and so this must be what he is talking about in Galatians 2:15–16. Note carefully how there is no real sense in this translation that Paul is doing anything other than laying out his own thinking about God, Christ, and salvation. ([Location 4008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4008))
- we consider this participatory gospel to be in conflict with any account that explains the relationship between God and humanity conditionally and contractually. ([Location 4015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4015))
- where JT advocates see Paul’s gospel unfolding we see something that is not Paul’s gospel—unless he is having a very bad day. Paul’s gospel is emphatically not contractual, and Box A is contractual. So our expectations lead us to explore the possibility that something else is going on in Box A that is not directly expressing Paul’s own position. ([Location 4016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4016))
- If Box A, simply in conceptual terms, is not Paul’s gospel because of its radically different, and ultimately rather sinister, transactional structure, which so derogates Jews, then what is it? It is legalistic, because Romans 2 develops the phrase “works of Torah” clearly in this way. And it is wrong. Paul clearly negates it in the text and does so repeatedly. The word “not” comes up a lot. “We are not declared righteous by doing works as prescribed by the Torah.” ([Location 4019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4019))
- Paul’s letter to the Galatians was an urgent, and apparently very passionate, epistle that he composed to counter the influence at Galatia of a group of rival leaders. These leaders were Jews, but they were more than this. In a critical fact often overlooked, a close reading of the letter suggests that they were also messianic Jews, which is to say that they were Jesus-followers like Paul, so they were, technically, part of the early church. ([Location 4026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4026))
- the letter’s arguments show that they laid claim to a cosier relationship with Jesus’s original friends, the Jerusalem apostles, than Paul himself enjoyed. And so they were present in Jerusalem, weighing in, when the church’s leadership deliberated on important matters at a key conference ([Location 4030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4030))
- the letter reveals that there is no love lost between this group and Paul. They are opposed to Paul. They clearly think Paul is a dangerous renegade who must have his teaching corrected in all his congregations. He is perilously close to being a heretic, if he isn’t one entirely. So they are traveling around reconverting all his converts to a better gospel—to their gospel. ([Location 4033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4033))
- Paul is deeply upset by the teaching they have arrived with in Galatia, and so he urges his converts there, in all sorts of ways, to reject it utterly. It is a false “gospel,” unworthy of that name (1:6–7). Only his teaching is the true gospel proclamation about God that comes, duly authorized, from God. ([Location 4038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4038))
- instead of a thanksgiving paragraph, Paul launches a scathing comparison, complete with curses. 1:6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion  and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4049))
- we will follow the lead of one of the most gracious modern interpreters of this entire sorry scenario, J. L. (Lou) Martyn, and call this opposing group in what follows “the teachers.” ([Location 4067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4067))
- The key point to note moving forward is that Paul clearly wrote his letter to the Galatians to counteract the false gospel of the teachers who had apparently arrived in Galatia and started converting his followers to a “better” version of the gospel—to their version, but a version that Paul views as false through and through. ([Location 4069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4069))
- the original Galatian recipients of the letter would have seen here straightaway a basic opposition between the false gospel of the teachers and the true gospel preached by the apostle Paul, from which it would follow that Box A refers in some way to the false (contractual) gospel of the teachers, and Box B refers to Paul’s (covenantal) gospel framed in response. ([Location 4084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4084))
- This system would have involved any uncircumcised male converts in Galatia getting circumcised, and then everyone in the community taking on board all the instructions in the teachings of Moses. So the community would have undertaken distinctive Jewish practices in relation to eating kosher food, Sabbath-keeping, observing the Jewish calendar more generally, sending money to the temple in Jerusalem, and so on. Paul’s pagan converts would, in short, have become Jews, and Jews of a certain distinctive sort: messianic, legalistic Jews. ([Location 4096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4096))
- It is a little hard to see what Jesus himself was contributing to this entire situation as the teachers seem to have laid it out, and the short answer from Paul’s point of view would be “not enough.” But it is not hard to imagine very early Jewish followers of Jesus underplaying Jesus’s saving significance. ([Location 4103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4103))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- First, it is, as later church tradition would say, “Pelagian.”183 It is far too optimistic about human nature and so about the possibility of salvation by works. For Paul, human nature is deeply corrupt. It cannot act rightly even if it wants to. (Paul is more “Augustinian.”) ([Location 4111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4111))
- the teachers’ gospel is, in its own terms, a one-way trip to hell. It proclaims salvation in terms that no corrupt person can actually achieve. “No one will be declared righteous on the day of judgment,” Paul asserts, quoting a scripture that also seems to know this important truth (see Gal 2:15c quoting Ps 143:2). ([Location 4114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4114))
- more importantly, this “gospel” directly undermines the only thing that can transform human nature and save the person: the gospel that points toward our participation in Christ. We are transformed and saved as we enter into the death and resurrection of Christ, as enacted in baptism, and as we are filled and revivified by his Spirit. ([Location 4117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4117))
- Box A is nothing more or less than the false contractual gospel of the teachers, and the reason why it clashes so deeply with so much of what Paul says elsewhere is now obvious; it does so because it is not his theology at all! Paul is bitterly opposed to this theology. Small wonder then that there are tensions. ([Location 4124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4124))
- we are reading his texts circumstantially, as an engagement with the practical concerns of his audience. This is always why Paul wrote his letters. He never wrote systematic theology per se, which is what JT advocates have to assume that he is doing uniquely when he starts into his JT arguments. ([Location 4129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4129))
- we expose here one of the most critical biases of JT advocates, which they have inherited unwittingly from church tradition. They read Paul’s JT texts anachronistically, as if the apostle was writing his theology out abstractly for the later church to ponder and to benefit from. And he is imagined as writing that theology out, moreover, from a position that is insensitive to Jews, who are viewed as having long separated from the Christian church, which is another important anachronism. ([Location 4131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4131))
- Box A is “another gospel.” It has nothing to do with Paul’s own theology, and he is deeply and angrily opposed to its imposition on his converts. ([Location 4136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4136))
- The legalistic depiction of the Jew in Box A is actually a depiction of salvation by a small legalistic group of Jews within the church who are, like all Pelagians, wildly over-optimistic about their own ability to act consistently in a good way. It is true that these Jewish teachers and their followers are legalistic. But there is no need to suggest this is true of all Jews or of Jews at their best. ([Location 4139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4139))
- All religious traditions seem to contain pockets of legalism, including the Christian tradition. But these are not necessarily representative of these religions at their best. ([Location 4142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4142))
- Box A has nothing to do with his own theology, except to highlight that he is emphatically not a conditional, contractual, transactional thinker when it comes to salvation. He is implacably opposed to this approach to salvation. His God is kinder and gentler all the way down—a God, in short, of grace. ([Location 4147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4147))
- As noted earlier, in chapter 4, JT occurs (ostensibly) in Rom 1:16—5:1; 6:7–8; 9:30—10:17; Gal 2:15—3:26; 5:5; Eph 2:8–10; and Phil 3:2–11. We estimate that this is about 172 verses within a total from Paul of around 1,791, or just under 10 percent of what we have from him. ([Location 4176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4176))
- We will be working with the NIV for much of what follows because that translation is so heavily affected by JT. Tracing this influence will be instructive. ([Location 4186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4186))
- These figures are best viewed as a rival missionary team within the early church, so they are messianic Jews, and we suggest that they lie behind all three letters that Paul composed where justification terms and arguments appear, Romans, Galatians, and Philippians (and we infer partly on these grounds that these letters were all written around the same time, from the fall of 51 through the spring of 52 CE; it was a difficult winter season for Paul). ([Location 4202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4202))
- It is very clear that the enemies, whom Martyn more respectfully calls “the teachers,” are present in Galatia, and equally clear in Philippians 3 that they are about to arrive in the city of Philippi. ([Location 4206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4206))
- But Romans is not usually presented as an engagement by Paul with a rival group of figures and their problematic theology. ([Location 4208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4208))
- Within the final instructions at the end of this great epistle we read: I urge you, brothers and sisters, to keep an eye on those who create dissensions and hindrances, in opposition to the teaching that you have learned; avoid them. For such people do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the simple-minded. ([Location 4210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4210))
- The language here is very similar to the language that Paul uses in Philippians to describe his enemies; they are driven by their “appetites” (literally “stomachs”) and not by God. (This is an ancient philosophical slur suggesting that someone is in the grip of their base instincts and not guided by the elevated thoughts and morals of the mind.) ([Location 4225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4225))
- Unlike in Galatia, however, where the teachers have already arrived and stirred up trouble within the region’s communities, this warning in Romans suggests that the teachers are on the way to Rome and have not yet arrived. The Jesus-followers at Rome are supposed to be on the lookout for their arrival (which is also what we see in Philippians 3, especially in verse 2). ([Location 4230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4230))
- Paul’s initial response is quite brilliant. The first thing he does is to show how this “gospel” collapses in on itself in terms of its own assumptions. So his audience in Rome does not even have to agree with him to see that his rivals are offering nothing useful. ([Location 4238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4238))
- We see this technique being used constantly by one of the ancient world’s most famous philosophers, namely, the figure of Socrates as he is presented in Plato’s dialogues. Plato has Socrates often beginning his dialogues by questioning some unfortunate passer-by or arrogant opponent and showing how their confidently held beliefs collapse in upon themselves.

- Few things are more effective at undermining an opponent’s credibility before a neutral audience than showing how their own position, taken on its own terms, falls apart once one knows where to look. Why listen any further to someone who can’t even present a coherent position? ([Location 4249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4249))
- order to attack the teachers’ gospel in its own terms Paul will first need to tell his Roman audience what it is, and like any good tactician, he chooses his ground carefully. He begins with the portion of the teachers’ teaching that creates the most vulnerabilities—their opening preaching with its fiery rhetoric and harsh judgment of outsiders, who are pagan. ([Location 4255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4255))
- while verses 18 to 32 are a rather short summary, they provide Paul’s Roman audience with just the right amount of information they need to recognize the teachers when they arrive. ([Location 4258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4258))
- it differs significantly from the material preceding it, especially 1:16–17, which we will spend some time focusing on a few chapters hence. In those verses, as we will see, Paul talks about God’s deliverance being revealed through the saving activity of a preeminently faithful figure, Jesus, who dies and rises again for us. We see here a God of compassion acting to save his people from an awful predicament within which they are distressed and helpless. And we see a powerful focus on Jesus as the expression of that compassion. These concerns are strongly signaled by verses 16 to 17. ([Location 4263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4263))
- These figures would also have been schooled by Paul at Corinth in just how to present the text of the letter, when they first received it to take it to Rome.) ([Location 4269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4269))
- In the language of Karl Barth we could say that the teacher begins with God’s “no” to humanity, after which he will try to speak a “yes.” But the initial “no” on his part has trapped him. His basic beliefs about God, uncorrected by any insights as revealed by Jesus, will prove to be a massive problem for the rest of his program—for ([Location 4278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4278))
- This is the basis of the teacher’s overall argument: every person knows what God is like, which is why pagans are fundamentally culpable for their sinful behavior. This position is commonly known in theological circles as “natural theology” or “general revelation,” because everyone in their natural state, wherever they are, can recognize the truth about God by observing the things around them, in general terms. ([Location 4291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4291))
- According to the teacher, not honoring God leads to people to dishonoring their bodies sexually with members of their own gender, by adopting “homosexual” and/or “effeminate” behavior, which in the case of males leads to some further punishment—quite probably sterility. ([Location 4332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4332))
- many Christians today actually agree with this theology. This kind of preaching tends to get deployed frequently against unbelievers and sometimes against other Christian groups as well. ([Location 4357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4357))
- The accusations about the retributive wrath of God being revealed against sinful people apply to others and not to the teacher himself or to people like him. And this is a common failing in arguments that a Socratic move will expose quite quickly. ([Location 4373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4373))
- Paul is basically saying to the teacher here then, “According to what you just said in your judgmental opening, O teacher, we must affirm that every person is saved by their good deeds in accordance with God’s will, or be damned in accordance with their bad deeds, right?” To do anything else would be unfair, and fairness is the whole basis of the argument—and the teacher will probably agree. ([Location 4431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4431))
- But these commitments are going to have a devastating impact on the rest of the teacher’s gospel, as he is forced to remain consistent with them. ([Location 4434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4434))

- the existence of this group causes a further problem for the teacher. It casts doubt on the positive proposals that the teacher is trying to introduce, namely, salvation through circumcision and Torah-observance. These are the practices that the teacher is urging on Paul’s gentile converts. The existence of a category of sinful Jews proves, however, that these practices do not… ([Location 4445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4445))
- Second, it follows from the teacher’s basic commitments as well that some pagans could exist who get saved by grasping God’s righteous commands by way of natural theology, simply by gazing at the cosmos, who now do not need to convert to the teacher’s Jewish program, getting circumcised and observing the teachings of Moses. They can be saved by attending simply to… ([Location 4449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4449))

- In 1:18–32, the teacher stated that pagans are without excuse because they know what is good but intentionally do the wrong things. So Paul points out here, quite fairly, that there is clearly sufficient information about God and what God expects of the pagans present for them to act correctly without the possession of the Jewish Torah if they choose to do so. ([Location 4483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4483))
- Because pagans have an innate Torah they can do the necessary good things required by God on their own without any instruction from the written Jewish Torah and so still be declared righteous by God. And it follows from this that, strictly speaking, the teacher now has no reason to evangelize them! They do not need him. His mission to the pagans converting them to Jewish observances is pointless. ([Location 4491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4491))
- while Paul is primarily concerned to engage Socratically with the teacher through chapters 2 through 3, he will occasionally insert small anticipations of his own position which lies further ahead in the letter: it is as if he finds it difficult to refrain from including what he himself actually thinks, so little comments can slip into the text. ([Location 4496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4496))
- One such comment is the statement we read here: this judgment according to deeds will take place when “according to my gospel, God through Christ Jesus judges the secret thoughts of all” (2:16). ([Location 4498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4498))
- one of the shocking features of the teacher’s gospel articulated in 1:18–32, is that it does not mention Jesus. Jesus plays no clear role within its assumptions, and he has no real function for the teacher in relation either to the knowledge of God or God’s nature. These all come from the Jewish Torah. ([Location 4501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4501))
- in fact Jesus cannot have a significant role within the teacher’s gospel. His centrality has been closed out from the beginning. An approach to righteousness and damnation based on deeds which are potentially known and performed everywhere self-evidently necessarily overrides any contribution coming from any particular or special revelation, which is how all knowledge of Jesus comes. ([Location 4503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4503))
- the teacher’s approach necessarily overrides the information we might get about God from the unconditionally liberative act effected through Christ, which occupies the very heart of Paul’s own thinking. Those who operate in terms of general revelation do not need special revelation, and Jesus is the heart of special revelation. ([Location 4506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4506))
- For Paul, true judgment takes place before Jesus, as Romans chapter 14 will state later on quite clearly, and this is a very different sort of judgment from the harsh scenario he is sketching out in Romans chapter 2.188 “My gospel,” says Paul, “views things very differently, especially on judgment day, with the help of Jesus.” ([Location 4511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4511))
- As we move into 2:17–29, Paul deepens his Socratic exposure of the teacher, pressing into the two embarrassing implications that he has already set up, namely, the presence of both sinful Jews and righteous pagans. ([Location 4518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4518))
- “The name of God is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you.” (Rom 2:17–24) ([Location 4538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4538))
- The teacher is clearly convinced that the written law supplies a decisive moral advantage for its adherents as well as a resulting advantage in terms of salvation. The pagans who lack the Jewish Torah also, in the teacher’s mind, lack the embodiment of knowledge and truth that it reveals. They are sinful to the core and need the saving presence of the Torah in their lives. ([Location 4548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4548))
- The teacher clearly believes that Torah-observance will help reverse this bad situation by illuminating the minds of pagans about God. Through the ongoing observance of Torah, they will regain and then maintain control over their sinful lusts. The spiral into disgusting sins will be reversed. ([Location 4555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4555))
- And circumcision doesn’t necessarily help either, as the teacher seems to have suggested. ([Location 4559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4559))
- Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law your circumcision has become uncircumcision. So, if the uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?  Then the physically uncircumcised person who keeps the law will judge you who, though having the written code and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law. (Rom 2:25–27) ([Location 4560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4560))
- So the teacher’s positive suggestion to sinful pagans that they get circumcised—if they are males, obviously—and start vigilantly observing the Torah’s instructions is not necessarily going to be any use. The existence of sinful rabbis proves this. ([Location 4576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4576))
- So it is now possible that these righteous pagans who keep the Torah written on their hearts will condemn an unfaithful Jewish person on judgment day, as verse 27 makes clear: “the physically uncircumcised person who keeps the law will judge you who, though having the written code and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law.” ([Location 4590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4590))
- As we press ever deeper into the assumptions driving the teacher’s “gospel” the very definition of who a Jew is begins to fall apart. For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something external and physical. Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by spirit,190 not the written code. Such a person receives praise not from humans but from God. (Rom 2:28–29 NRSVue modified) ([Location 4595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4595))
- Paul is effectively saying to the teacher here, “According to what you’ve been saying about people deserving damnation or salvation depending on their deeds, the righteous are the ones who are truly Jewish, right? You’re basically admitting that righteous gentiles are the true Jews! People who just look like Jews don’t really count. After all, they are not always saved. And these righteous pagans are.” ([Location 4605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4605))
- The word “Jew” comes from “Judah,” which means, in Hebrew, “praise.” So Paul is suggesting here that, in terms of the teacher’s system, those who receive “praise from God” are really the true Jews, right? And they are not actually Jews . . . ! This is where your “gospel” has led us! ([Location 4608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4608))
- The teacher has foolishly ended up defining Jewish identity in terms of anyone who has access to God’s expectations through nature and obeys them; such a person receives God’s “praise” on the day of judgment, and so will effectively be called a “Jew” at that moment. So the teacher has unwittingly undermined the importance and distinct privilege of Jewish Torah-observance in general and circumcision in particular for gentiles. He has made himself and his people irrelevant. ([Location 4612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4612))
- The two complementary arguments of chapter 2 have done a lot of damage. The pagans clearly do not need to convert to the teacher’s particular Jewish program. They could just get saved on their own. And there is no guarantee that Jews are any better than they are. ([Location 4621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4621))
- He is in Corinth at time of writing, and he has to go to Jerusalem first, before he can head for Rome—exactly the wrong direction, and a very long journey. ([Location 4630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4630))
- A careful reading of Rom 14 reveals that while there is an important moment of accountability before Jesus’s judgment throne, this is not a salvific examination but more like a pedagogical, parental evaluation. It is an evaluative judgment, and this is categorically different from the judgment being talked about in Rom 1–2. ([Location 4634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4634))
- Philo, who may have influenced the thinking of the teachers, held that circumcision of the heart, which was the seat of the person, could take place in a spiritual way, literally by way of the “breath” animating the body. This statement in Romans closely reproduces a statement in one of his writings. ([Location 4640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4640))
- So Paul asks the teacher a question directly in 3:1–9 that was implicit in 2:17–20: Do Jews, according to the teacher’s gospel, have any advantage at all when it matters? ([Location 4733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4733))
- The result of the conversation in general then, and this final back and forth between the two interlocutors in particular, is that the teacher ends up giving a different answer from the one he gave in response to Paul’s initial question in verse 1. Paul places that question again in verse 9. And the teacher responds now as he should have answered in verse 2. Jews do not enjoy any advantages in the final judgment, and if they sin they will be sentenced to death like everyone else. ([Location 4765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4765))
- The Scriptures, which the teacher knows and swears by, “entrusted by God to his people,” speak repeatedly of the way that all humanity, obviously including Jews, sin, in multiple ways and on every level. ([Location 4791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4791))
- If it is the case that all have sinned, then it follows that in terms of the teacher’s own account of salvation—his gospel—no one will be saved. And no one can be saved. ([Location 4814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4814))
- it is pretty crippling to have to admit that a gospel offering a way to salvation with God in fact saves no one. It is literally a gospel that does not work. The good news is just bad news. ([Location 4824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4824))
- Universal sinfulness, which the Scriptures attest to so clearly, entails that everyone will be condemned, including the teacher himself. So his gospel is not merely pointless as a missionary endeavor; it is a complete failure in salvific terms. There is no salvation on offer through its teachings at all! ([Location 4832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4832))
- Box B is not the second stage in Paul’s gospel; it is Paul’s gospel and so it needs to align with what Paul declares in his gospel everywhere else. ([Location 4926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4926))
- It is not that JT is entirely wrong. As we have had frequent cause to note in what precedes, JT exegetes are accurate readers. It is just that here their reading is too thin. Their reading of Box B focuses too strongly on the journey of an individual convert to faith—because this is all that it expects to find—and consequently overlooks the role that Jesus is playing. ([Location 4934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4934))
- But it is the recovery of the centrality of Jesus to what is going on that opens up the possibility that this data is a special sort of announcement of what Paul says everywhere else in his writings—about how we are saved by participating in Christ. ([Location 4937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4937))
- The way forward then will turn out to revolve almost entirely around what Paul means by faith when he speaks of it in his JT texts, which he does so repeatedly. It is the central motif in Box B. ([Location 4945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4945))
- the translators of the latest NIV cited below, render Paul’s original Greek in key JT texts like Galatians 2:15–16 roughly as follows: 15 We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. ([Location 4950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4950))
- The word “justified,” used here three times, is translating the Greek verb dikaioō, ([Location 4960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4960))
- Wright sees Jesus’s faithfulness to the point of death in Box B as revealing the covenant faithfulness of the God of Israel because Wright attributes such a strong and pervasive role to the God of Israel in Paul’s writings.194 And if Wright is correct, even in basic terms, then a new perspective opens up on what Paul is saying in Box B that could sustain our new approach to this material as a whole. ([Location 4978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4978))
- We actually have numerous examples of just this sort of ambiguity in English genitives as well. The phrase the “love of my wife” is a genitive because it uses the word “of.” THE LOVE—OF—MY WIFE But it is not clear what this phrase means exactly when we read it in isolation. ([Location 4986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4986))
- Since she is the acting subject of the love we would call this “a subjective genitive.” The word in the genitive, here “of my wife,” consequently denotes the acting subject of the verb. ([Location 4998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=4998))
- The most common translation, which you will find in the vast majority of English Bibles, is “faith in Christ.” This is an objective understanding of the genitive because Christ is the object of a person’s faith in this reading. We could call this an I-centered understanding of faith, as the emphasis is on the person who has faith in Christ, here “me” (or you).198 Clearly the translators of the NIV think that this is what is going on. And if a translator is grounded in JT then this decision just looks obvious. ([Location 5012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5012))
- there is very little room within the logic of JT for Jesus himself to have faith. He alone of all humanity does not need to journey from sinful legalism to salvation by faith alone. He is the one person who is saved by perfectly doing works, and the entire model relies on this, especially as someone like Piper develops it; we need Jesus’s perfect righteousness to be imputed to us. So a subjective reading just makes no sense to a JT advocate whereas an objective reading seems to fit like a hand in a glove. ([Location 5020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5020))
- Galatians 2:16 is not the only text in Paul that contains the critical genitive phrase “faith of Jesus” or its close equivalent. He uses it about half a dozen times: see, in addition to the two occurrences in Galatians 2:16, 2:20, and 3:22; Romans 3:22–26; Ephesians 3:12; and Philippians 3:9.200 And some of the clearest and most concise evidence that Paul is speaking in all these texts of Jesus’s own faithfulness, and then derivatively of the faith we get by participating in him, can, we suggest, be found in Romans, Galatians’s sibling text, in 3:22. ([Location 5048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5048))
- read in this way, with this verb supplied, verses 21 and 22 contrast a righteousness of God revealed not by the Torah but by faith, which is what Paul is always doing in his JT texts. He is writing about Box A and Box B stating that the former is wrong and the latter is correct. Verse 21 is a negation of Box A, although it also contains other crucial information, and verse 22 is Box B, which always revolves around faith. ([Location 5076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5076))
- now comes the all-important realization. If “the righteousness of God” is “made manifest” through “faith” in some relation to “Jesus” then the ambiguous genitive construction “faith of Jesus” present in Paul’s Greek really has to be Jesus’s own faith and not the faith of converts, whose faith is mentioned here just after Jesus’s in a derivative location when Paul writes “for all who believe.” Why? Because of the little word “through.” This denotes instrumentality. ([Location 5089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5089))
- The faith of Jesus spoken of here is the instrument by means of which something is happening, and in these verses it is the instrument by means of which the righteousness of God is made manifest or revealed. ([Location 5093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5093))
- It makes complete sense to suppose that Jesus reveals God’s dramatic action that saves the cosmos from sin. Jesus is God’s dramatic action that saves the cosmos from sin. Jesus’s death and resurrection are obviously the focal point of everything Paul wants to say that God is doing on our behalf in relation to a fallen and broken world. ([Location 5102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5102))
- We are transformed as we participate by way of the Spirit in the critical Easter events Jesus experienced, the journey that baptism enacts and Romans chapter 6 will spell out. This is Paul’s gospel, a gospel that speaks of a divine act accomplished through Jesus that discloses to the world just what God is like and what God is doing through Jesus. Jesus’s faith—understanding this motif especially as Philippians 2:6–8 does, as his obedient faithfulness ultimately to a death by crucifixion—clearly reveals or makes manifest and so shows the world what God the Father is doing through him. ([Location 5104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5104))
- In short, Jesus is the instrument by means of which God the Father’s righteous plan and purposes are both effected and disclosed. ([Location 5109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5109))
- Conversely, it makes no sense to suppose that our faith functions to reveal God’s righteous action to save the cosmos, ([Location 5111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5111))
- at this point we notice a problem for the JT reading in terms of the individual’s saving decision of faith. Our faith just doesn’t really work this way—as an instrument for making things known. It does not and cannot operate as a kind of tool that takes things that are unknown and makes them known because it just doesn’t mean this or work in this way, and especially when we are talking about God. ([Location 5117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5117))
- Think of something you don’t know but would like to know, like the question we sometimes ask ourselves—is there intelligent life on an M-class planet in some part of the galaxy around Alpha Centauri? Now try to use your beliefs or faith as a tool to figure out if this is true or not. ([Location 5123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5123))
- in Romans 3:22 Paul is speaking about something concerning God being made known by an instrument. God’s righteous nature and plan are being revealed. And faith here is some sort of tool that makes that happen. (We are talking about the first instance of faith in this verse, through which something happens; the second instance of faith—our faith—denotes for whom it happens.) ([Location 5137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5137))
- So a subjective genitive reading fits here perfectly. And it fits in with a revealing God. God is making himself understood and obvious through Jesus. The Father is revealed through his Son. ([Location 5145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5145))
- We should re-translate this text accordingly. 21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it; 22 [And t]he righteousness of God [has been manifested] through the faith of Jesus Christ for all who believe. (ESV suitably modified) ([Location 5155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5155))
- Once we notice the details of the text, we realize that Paul is talking about something subtly different—something that revolves around Jesus and not around us. And what can be problematic about suggesting this? Paul is always talking about Jesus. Indeed, after 3:22, he doesn’t really stop talking about Jesus until he is well into chapter 9, and even then Jesus is everywhere presupposed. ([Location 5179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5179))
- This sentence should be translated as the footnotes in the NIV recommend: 15 We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified on the basis of the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. ([Location 5184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5184))
- an important question then arose after we had reached this conclusion, namely, just why does Paul refer to Jesus’s faith? We turn to answer this important question here. ([Location 5243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5243))
- The phrase “by the works of the law no one will be justified” is a verbatim reproduction of Psalm 143:2 which Paul quotes again in Romans 3:20 just before he writes 3:21–22. Hence, it seems that Paul is quoting or alluding to Jewish Scripture in his JT discussions, and this should not surprise us. ([Location 5269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5269))
- it follows that Paul must try to counter that learning, which is so shaking his converts, by presenting them with his own array of scriptural texts. He must show that the Scriptures are on his side. He must win this particular, very early, battle for the Bible. ([Location 5290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5290))
- We can see Paul repeatedly either quoting or alluding to—in no particular order, and not even counting some of the secondary scriptural appeals—Psalm 98:2, Leviticus 18:5, Deuteronomy 27:26, Genesis 15:6, Psalm 143:2, Isaiah 28:16 and 52:7, Joel 2:32 (which in the Septuagint is 3:5), and Habakkuk 2:4.204 Paul stitches all these verses together throughout his JT texts into a powerful refutation of his opponent’s gospel and an affirmation of his own. ([Location 5294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5294))
- (This was a standard expository technique that trained rabbis in his day used that we sometimes refer to as “pearl-stringing” or “catch-word linkage.”) ([Location 5302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5302))
- When we read Paul’s Box B texts carefully, especially in the original Greek, we can see that the phrase that he often uses to speak about faith, namely, “through faith,” is a direct allusion to one of these Scripture texts. This phrase reproduces exactly the faith phrase that occurs in the middle of Habakkuk 2:4: The righteous one through faith will live. (Our translation) ([Location 5308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5308))
- we can see that Habakkuk 2:4 was a very important scriptural text for Paul. He echoes its key faith phrase, “through faith,” through Galatians and Romans, his two key JT letters, no less than twenty times. And these are the two letters where he quotes Habakkuk 2:4 explicitly as well. ([Location 5312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5312))
- So Habakkuk 2:4 is clearly grounding a lot of Paul’s faith talk in his Box B texts. No other text receives this level of emphasis from him—not even Genesis 15:6 and Isaiah 28:16, which also use believing language. ([Location 5315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5315))
- now we can see that the Greek used to refer to the faith of Jesus, which usually speaks of something important happening “through” the faith of Jesus, is being drawn directly from Habakkuk chapter 2:4. So it follows from this in a fairly straightforward way that Paul must be reading Habakkuk 2:4 as a messianic prophecy that points toward Jesus. ([Location 5321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5321))
- The righteous one through faith will live. This Jesus-centered reading of Habakkuk 2:4 by Paul becomes clearer for us modern readers when we realize that “The Righteous One” was a title that many early Jesus-followers used to refer to Christ, probably because of the influence of Isaiah 53, where that description comes up in verse 11. (Few texts were as important to the first Christians as Isaiah 53.) Out of his anguish he shall see;     he ([Location 5324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5324))
- In like manner, when Habakkuk 2:4 says that the Righteous One “will live” it predicts—of course—Jesus’s resurrection from the dead. ([Location 5337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5337))
- Habakkuk 2:4 as a whole is read by Paul as a wonderfully compressed prediction by the prophet of Paul’s gospel, as it announces the death and resurrection of Jesus: “The Righteous One [that is, Jesus, whom we also see predicted in Isaiah 53] through faith [that is, through his extraordinary journey of faithfulness to the cross] will live [that is, be resurrected, lifted up, and enthroned at God’s right hand].” ([Location 5338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5338))
- When we grasp that Paul is using the faith language of Habakkuk 2:4 to speak about Jesus, and to speak in particular about his faithful walk to the cross, we can see straightaway that Jesus can be right at the center of Paul’s Box B texts, just as he is at the center of the transformational material that Paul develops directly in the 90 percent of material outside of the JT texts. ([Location 5344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5344))
- Every time the language of Habakkuk 2:4 is either quoted or alluded to we must realize that Paul is talking about Jesus, so about twenty times in Romans and Galatians at least. ([Location 5347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5347))
- every time he uses the phrase “through faith” he evokes Habakkuk 2:4 as a whole, which speaks of the entirety of Jesus’s activity on our behalf through all the events of Easter—his obedience, death, resurrection, and ascension, although we can probably detect a special emphasis here on the events leading up to the cross. ([Location 5348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5348))
- the words “through faith” in all of Paul’s Box B texts do nothing less than repeatedly evoke “the old rugged cross.” ([Location 5352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5352))
- We must be constantly attentive to the way that Paul’s language of faith can open out directly into Jesus, and only within us as it passes through him—a thoroughly participatory claim.208 Our faith is still important! ([Location 5354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5354))
- we must be constantly alert to the degree to which scriptural language is influencing the language in his JT texts as a whole, sifting their distinctive vocabulary and imagery. When we read in this way, connections with the transformational gospel that he speaks of everywhere else become apparent. Box B, properly understood, really does unpack into the other 90 percent of Pauline data. ([Location 5357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5357))
- Paul uses a distinctive verb frequently in his JT texts, the usual translation of which even gives justification theory its name: “justification” (strictly speaking, rendering the verb here as a participle or verbal noun). Advocates of JT claim that this verb points directly toward the retributive God who underlies their model, and that this meaning needs to be held constant from Box A to Box B. ([Location 5365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5365))
- when it occurs in Box A, we suggest that the verb often translated “justify” is really more accurately translated “to pronounce righteous” or “to pronounce innocent of any wrongdoing,” and we will translate accordingly. The view underlying this translation and use of the verb is of course retributive, because here, in this broader scenario, the teachers expect God to be retributive, measuring out the right proportion of either reward or punishment and “paying” ([Location 5376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5376))
- Paul does not want his converts frightened insecurely by the teachers into thinking that there is still something to do. Salvation is a fact, not a future event to be waited for uncertainly—and this even though the people who have been baptized into Jesus and raised through the power of the divine Spirit are still obviously, in certain respects, wicked, sinful, mortal creatures made of flesh like him. ([Location 5385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5385))
- How does Paul get from the teachers’ claim concerning the need for converts to be pronounced innocent of all wrongdoing in the future to his own claim that this has already happened as we have participated in the death and resurrection of Jesus as symbolized by baptism? ([Location 5391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5391))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- this. A verdict enacts, performs, and achieves certain things. It does not just pronounce that certain states of affairs exist (which would be simply to recognize the presence of a piece of information). It is a “doing-word” in Luther’s terminology—a command! ([Location 5399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5399))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- The teachers are consequently urging Paul’s followers to convert to full law-observance and to seek a verdict of “fully righteous” that will save them. They are basically frightening Paul’s converts into obedience with the prospect of this uncertain, future, retributive scenario (and this is what all “turn-or-burn” preachers do). ([Location 5413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5413))
    - **Tags:** #orange
- Paul’s constant counterclaim to this suggestion by the teachers through his JT texts is that his own converts have already experienced this “verdict” from God since they have been baptized into Jesus and they already participate in him. This verdict is past and it is positive. (It is also not retributive.) To have died and risen with Christ is to have passed through the only “verdict” that counts. This was when the decisive step into salvation took place, into the glories of the age to come. The sentence of death has been replaced by a judgment of life. ([Location 5416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5416))
- God has pronounced us released from sin, the flesh, and death. We have been set free. ([Location 5422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5422))
- In him, as we participate in him, we are released from the prison of our flesh. When we were in the flesh, as descendants of Adam, we were enslaved and imprisoned, guarded, and ultimately sentenced to death. But by being connected to Jesus we have passed through his death and entered into his resurrection and thereby into glorious, new, and incorruptible life. So any verdict has already taken place, and it has been positive; we have been “exonerated” and “acquitted,” which is to say, set free. ([Location 5435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5435))
- Moreover, we know what sort of God we are involved with because he has paradoxically “acquitted” the ungodly! He must be a God of overwhelming compassion. And this God will not suddenly turn on us and sentence us to death on the day of judgment. He has released us from our sin, liberating us from its grip and its consequences. ([Location 5439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5439))
- Paul’s baptismal use of dikaioō is also seen very clearly in 1 Corinthians 6:11 and his liberational use in Galatians 3:24. So these texts allow us to supply this meaning wherever he is using the verb to explicate his own position. ([Location 5450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5450))
- it will no longer be necessary to use the translation “justification,” which tends now to do far too much theological work. When the teachers speak of “justification” they really do mean that a retributive God judges someone to be righteous—literally, innocent of wrongdoing—and so worthy of salvation. However, when Paul speaks of “justification” he means that a compassionate God has set us free from the prison of our sin and from the sentence of death. ([Location 5456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5456))
- As a rough rule of thumb, when Paul uses the verb within the system of his opponents, the teachers, it is future and it means “to declare righteous [or, innocent of all wrongdoing].” The underlying assumption is retributive because the gospel of his opponents, the teachers, assumes a retributive God. When Paul uses the verb to evoke his own gospel, however, it operates in the past, or in the present presupposing a past event, and denotes the transformation of the “ungodly” by the resurrected Jesus. ([Location 5460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5460))
- grasp Paul’s meaning in Galatians 2:15–16 rather more clearly than we possibly did before: 15 We who are Jews by birth and not “sinful pagans,” 16 who know that a person is not released by doing works prescribed by the law except also “through the faith” of Jesus Christ, even we believed concerning Christ Jesus that we are released “through the faith” of Christ and not by doing the works prescribed by the law— [and so we know also]213 that “by works of the law no one will be declared righteous.” (Our translation) ([Location 5468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5468))
- Paul’s compact argument now makes excellent sense. Jews like Paul, who were Torah-observant, have encountered Christ, been baptized, and so set free from their sin so that they can taste the presence of the resurrection at work now, even as they continue to shape their lives from the Torah’s instructions. It follows from this, however, that the release that has just been experienced comes through Christ and not through any Torah-observance that they were undertaking prior to his arrival. ([Location 5480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5480))
- It was Christ who made the difference! We are saved and resurrected through Christ and not through Torah. Moreover, in the light of this discovery, experienced through Jesus, we can see, as Scripture says, that no one is going to get declared righteous on a putative future day of judgment by undertaking Torah-observance. Again, ([Location 5484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5484))
- seems likely that Paul is again drawing on material from the Scriptures here, specifically the opening of Psalm 98:1b–3: ([Location 5505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5505))
- In this psalm God is described as saving in relation to Jews and pagans (literally, the house of Israel and the nations), and this action is even said to be “revealing” his righteousness to them. There is so much overlap in vocabulary and thought evident here that we can be confident that the language of Psalm 98 is informing Paul’s words in Romans 1:16–17. ([Location 5513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5513))
- this basic connection helps us to grasp what Paul actually means when he uses the phrase “God’s righteousness” or its close equivalent. We can turn to the psalm to mine a much richer vein of information about the special meaning of this distinctive phrase. ([Location 5517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5517))
- when “righteousness” language occurs in these specific contexts, it is referring to a saving or rescuing activity, and to an associated executive judgment, and so the Jewish Publication Society’s translation of this verse in their edition of the Old Testament even renders “righteousness” here as “triumph.” ([Location 5523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5523))
- In situations where God’s people are in some kind of difficulty or struggle or overwhelming battle, something “right” happens precisely when God rescues them and delivers them. ([Location 5532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5532))
- God’s righteousness in biblical terminology, by way of texts like Psalm 98, while it often referred to judicial actions, could also refer to the sorts of executive, kingly actions that we find in stories like that of the exodus (see Exod 12–15), the conquests (see Josh 1–12), and the saving of Jerusalem from the Assyrians (see Isa 36–37). These were the right delivering acts of Israel’s divine King and here God’s righteousness is revealed through God’s activity of visiting executive judgment on his people’s enemies and liberating his people. ([Location 5540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5540))
- this is the sense that is present in Psalm 98:1–2, which is being taken up again by Paul in Romans 1:17. ([Location 5545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5545))
- it makes the good sense to translate the Greek here as “the deliverance of God is being revealed through faith . . . ,” the latter being a reference to Jesus’s death and resurrection. ([Location 5546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5546))
- What could be more plausible than to suggest that Paul is declaring here that God’s greatest act of triumph and deliverance is both accomplished by and seen in the death and resurrection of Jesus?! ([Location 5547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5547))
- It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Paul sees Jesus as the physical embodiment of God’s royal rescue operation, although this obvious focal point allows us to be even more specific. ([Location 5567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5567))
- God’s “triumph” over a rebellious and enslaved cosmos—his kingly “righteousness” that saves and liberates—is for Paul definitively effected by, and revealed through, the events of Easter. In particular, when Jesus rises from the dead he triumphs over the hostile forces of sin and death. So the content of God’s “righteousness” for Paul is Jesus’s resurrection, which is of course just what Paul talks about everywhere else in his Box B texts. ([Location 5569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5569))
- The faith of Jesus is a reference, by way of Habakkuk 2:4, to his faithfulness to the cross, followed by his resurrection to new life; the verb dikaioō speaks of the “judgment” from God that takes place as we participate in this journey, through baptism, and are thereby liberated or released from the prison of our sin and the sentence of death; and “the righteousness of God” evokes the liberating intervention and victory of our divine King, as he delivers us. ([Location 5576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5576))
- Strictly speaking, “faith” is a metonym or synecdoche in which a part stands in for a whole. So Paul will also allude to the entirety of Easter by speaking of Jesus’s “obedience,” “submission,” “death,” “cross,” and “blood.” Each one of these is, strictly speaking, a single element within the broader story, but each one evokes the entirety of that broader story. ([Location 5592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5592))
- We have learned from 3:21–26 that Paul makes his claims vis-à-vis the teacher in scriptural language; moreover, controlling for this texture in his writing, one of his key assertions is that God’s own righteous act is a great act of deliverance on our behalf effected through Jesus’s “faith[fulness],” and apprehended by all those who have faith, which really means, it is effected through Jesus’s obedience that culminated in his death on the cross, followed by his resurrection and ascension. ([Location 5623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5623))
- This event revealed God’s “triumph” over a sinful cosmos, and his “deliverance” of his people. And it is this event that led to a “judgment” from God over us of release and liberation as we participate in Jesus through baptism and are thereby released from the captivity of our sin and liberated from a sentence of death. ([Location 5627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5627))
- for JT advocates, Romans chapter 4 is where Paul uses an authoritative illustration from Scripture to explicate his central belief in justification by faith alone and not by works. Understood in these terms, this chapter has been viewed as a towering fortress for the theory’s central claims. But we have a rather different understanding of what is going on in Paul’s JT texts. ([Location 5633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5633))
- The important subsection that leads into Romans 4, namely, 3:27–31, tends to be neglected by JT readers (especially verses 29 to 31), as does the back third of chapter 4, verses 16 to 25, which is a big chunk of material. Liberated from JT’s expectations, we will read 3:27—4:25 as a whole and show how the short subsection of 3:27–31 integrates neatly into Paul’s ongoing critique of the teacher’s gospel, ([Location 5639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5639))
- our non-JT reading of 3:27—4:25 is better than the JT approach; it is closer to Paul’s text and makes excellent sense of all of it. ([Location 5644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5644))
- Paul’s basic claim throughout is, as we might expect, that “Abraham—properly read—supports my gospel and not yours.” ([Location 5645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5645))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- he runs this thesis through several specific issues before finishing with a compact statement of his resurrectional gospel in verse 25. ([Location 5646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5646))
- We are reading Paul’s JT texts as a debate between an advocate of a false gospel in Box A, the teacher, and Paul’s advocacy of a resurrectional gospel in Box B, by way of a heavy use of Scripture. So what we find from 3:27 onward is that more than one issue is in play, as is usually the case in debates between complex positions. ([Location 5652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5652))
- several features of the teacher’s gospel are compared with Paul’s gospel in relation to the authoritative and decisive figure of Abraham, features we have already met before as we processed the unhealthy internal dynamics of the teacher’s viewpoint. Paul effectively announces these issues that he is going to revisit now from a scriptural viewpoint rooted in the Torah in a jaunty dialogue that runs from 3:27 through 3:31. ([Location 5655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5655))
- The teacher’s entire approach is based on merit. So we can understand why the teacher would be worried that Paul’s gospel of Box B has removed the boasting that results from doing good works. It is good to boast about one’s accomplishments and to glory in their achievement, he would say. That is what motivates people to try to be good. Who doesn’t rightly boast about winning a gold medal at the Olympics? You earned it right?! So the teacher’s concern that Paul’s approach cuts against this behavior is correct. ([Location 5667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5667))
- But the teacher follows up quickly. The teacher: “Through what kind of teaching [nomos]? A teaching of works?” (3:27b NRSVue modified) Paul: “No, rather through a teaching [nomos] based on faith. For we hold that a person is released ‘through faith’ apart from works prescribed by the law.” (3:27b–28 NRSVue modified) ([Location 5679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5679))
- While we have often spoken in what precedes about two gospels, both the teacher and Paul would also have described their programs as “teachings,” in Hebrew, torah(s), rooted in the Jewish Scriptures. Torah was translated in Paul’s day by the Greek word nomos, and most English translations of the New Testament go on to render nomos in English very unfortunately as “law.” ([Location 5688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5688))
- Torah, along with nomos in the right contexts, is really best translated as “teaching.” It denotes the sacred teaching handed down to the Jewish people by God at Mount Sinai. So when we read “law” in our Bibles we often should really be reading “sacred teaching” and thinking of the discussion as focusing on the Bible and what it instructs. ([Location 5692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5692))
- we can now see that what the text is really talking about here are two different sets of “teachings” (not two laws). These teachings are of course supposed to be attested to by the Scriptures; we could say that they are Teachings with a capital “T.” ([Location 5695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5695))
- So basically the teacher is challenging Paul to prove how his gospel, which excludes boasting and is centered on faith, is a legitimate teaching from the Scriptures, and he is doubtless going to challenge him to get this teaching from the most important part of the Scriptures for Jews, namely, the first five books, which comprise the teachings of Moses—the torah proper! Nothing matched this part of the Tanakh for Jews in authority and centrality. ([Location 5699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5699))
- the teacher now expresses a worry that Paul’s gospel revealed “apart from the law” and “through faith” has broadened out the boundaries of God’s people much too far. For the teacher, God’s people are defined by their observance of the Torah, and by their observance of one of its most crucial commandments, circumcision. So he asks: The teacher: “Or is [not] God the God of Jews only?!” ([Location 5704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5704))
- The teacher: “Or is [not] God the God of Jews only?!” (3:29a) Paul: “Is he not the God of gentiles also?” (3:29a) The second question here is not a repetition; it is Paul’s own quick counter-assertion framed in terms drawn from the Scriptures that the teacher must accept. ([Location 5713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5713))
- Paul: “If God is one, or unified —the God who will deliver the circumcised ‘through faith’— then it follows that he will also deliver the uncircumcised ‘through that same faith.’” (3:30) ([Location 5723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5723))
- Paul’s point will be missed if we fail to catch the echo of Habakkuk 2:4 though. Read as a reference to the Messiah, Paul’s point here using the language of this Scripture in particular is that both Jews and gentiles are delivered because of the faithful Christ’s journey to death and his subsequent resurrection to new life. ([Location 5731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5731))
- follows from this then that the verse as a whole is suggesting that the unified God has acted in a unified way over all of humanity, which he created and rules—so why restrict the boundaries of salvation to the circumcised? ([Location 5734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5734))
- As we noted earlier on, the teacher, like all Jews, regarded the first five books of the Bible, handed down personally to Moses on Mount Sinai, as especially authoritative. So the issue being introduced here is the concern that Paul’s emphasis on Christ’s faithful death and resurrection decenters the Torah, meaning the Pentateuch, in a way that is inappropriate, ([Location 5741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5741))
- So the teacher is really just asking, are we eviscerating the teachings of Moses if we follow your strange emphasis on the faithful One and those who have faith within him? ([Location 5746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5746))
- how does Paul find Jesus and the resulting gospel that he preaches to the pagans in the Torah? It is not easy. Jesus is much easier to find predicted in the Prophets. But then Paul is a very skilled exegete, as we will see through the rest of Romans ([Location 5769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5769))
- This chapter has three subsections that run through the three issues that the teacher has just introduced—the exclusion of boasting and works, the broadening of the circle of salvation beyond the circumcised to uncircumcised pagans, and an upholding as against a negating of the Torah—all ([Location 5771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5771))
- The teacher: “What then are we to say was gained by Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about.” (Rom 4:1–2a, emphasis added) ([Location 5780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5780))
- the teacher is appealing to a common reading of Abraham by Jews in Paul’s day when he does this. Many if not all Jews venerated Abraham and held that he was a perfectly righteous figure. He was fully righteous, justified by his works, and so he could boast. Hence, the teacher makes a quite understandable appeal to Abraham as someone who was declared righteous by God because of his works. ([Location 5787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5787))
- So JT readers will sometimes take this text as suggesting that God views or considers Abraham (and later us) as in some sense righteous. God considers Abraham as righteous. But it is better to read this word in context as “credited.” ([Location 5805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5805))
- An act of giving to those who do not strictly deserve it is in view here, and not an action of giving in relation to deserving and earning. This is just what the text says. Those who believe, and not those who “work” or “earn,” receive deliverance. ([Location 5826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5826))
- So it seems that in God’s economy something is simply given to people as they trust in him without working or earning, and it is just as well because in this way God can gift important things to sinners who are undeserving. Thus, Paul points out fairly that the Torah here, in this verse, clearly disavows any notion of works as the basis of God’s activity of gifting deliverance to Abraham. ([Location 5828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5828))
- Abraham is not treated by God in accordance with works and desert in Genesis 15:6, and so works-based achievement and any boasting about this are excluded, as Paul earlier claimed in 3:27. Rather, we see here the importance of trust. God has written a divine check, as it were, to the patriarch, that was not worked for or earned, ([Location 5843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5843))
- God relates to us by giving to us, and not by rewarding us. ([Location 5846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5846))
- Throughout verses 9 through 12 Paul makes the simple argument that God’s deliverance was promised to Abraham in relation to his trusting, as attested by Genesis 15:6, and this trust took place well in advance of circumcision, although a little knowledge of the Pentateuch will be needed for any understanding of what Paul is getting at here. ([Location 5851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5851))
- it is technically fair of Paul to point out that the promises were made to Abraham in advance of the covenant of circumcision, and were initially responded to simply by faith. A considerable amount of time actually elapsed in Abraham’s life between the two events. In Genesis 16:16, some time after the giving of the promises in chapter 15, he is eighty-six. In 17:1, when the covenant of circumcision is given, he is ninety-nine (and in 21:5, when Isaac is born, he is one hundred). So he is faithful, without being circumcised, for at least fifteen years. ([Location 5860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5860))
- Paul’s argument in these verses in Romans is that “righteousness” is given to Abraham in both the uncircumcised and the circumcised state, hence he can technically be the father of both types of later believers. So it is important to see that Paul does not exclude Jewish believers here, and he also makes room for circumcision as a sign of the covenant. ([Location 5864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5864))
- believing pagans do not carry this precious sign in their bodies. They believe and are gifted with deliverance, like Abram was in Genesis 15, while messianic Jews believe and are gifted with deliverance in their circumcised state, like Abraham was in Genesis 17. There is room for both groups and both groups can be said to be copying Abraham in some sense. ([Location 5867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5867))
- it follows from this, more controversially, that pagans do not need to be circumcised in order to receive God’s promised salvation, and that salvation does not need to be restricted to the circle of those who are circumcised. ([Location 5888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5888))
- Paul also does something a little strange here with the meaning of circumcision. He redefines it in terms of a “seal.” Circumcision would have been considered a “sign” of involvement within God’s covenant people by most of the Jews in his day because this word is in the scriptural text, in Genesis 17; and in fact circumcision was the sign of the covenant made by God then with Abraham and his posterity. However, Paul qualifies this function by suggesting that circumcision is a seal or a stamp. ([Location 5890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5890))
- “Seals” confirm something that is already established on other grounds. So ancient figures sealed or stamped goods that had been purchased, and Paul himself speaks repeatedly of the way that the Spirit seals Jesus-followers, marking them as God’s possession before his return in glory and the final acquisition of his purchased property (so to speak). ([Location 5894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5894))
- By using the word “seal” then Paul is saying that the prior, more fundamental state in Jesus-followers that the sign of circumcision “seals” is their faith (which is really another seal or stamp on their life within the faithful Jesus). ([Location 5896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5896))
- So here Paul affirms the primary importance of the underlying state of being in Christ, which is denoted by the presence of faith—at which moment we see how the circumstantial arguments of Romans 4 continue to unpack into the participatory and resurrectional gospel. ([Location 5898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5898))
- In the light of Genesis 15:6, Paul is also able to counter the teacher’s suggestion that his gospel eviscerates or negates the Torah, ([Location 5904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5904))
- All the laws about blood and purity and food and communal behavior—the teachings that rabbis later expanded into the sixty-three volumes of the Talmud—seem to have been left to one side. Paul’s gospel seems to be gutting most of the important things the Pentateuch says out of the picture entirely, and the teacher simply names this shocking fact. But Paul rejects this suggestion and reverses it. Anyone who tries to detach the inheritance of the future world from faith is eviscerating the Torah, he asserts rather boldly. ([Location 5907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5907))
- If the terms of the later inheritance promised to Abraham and his descendants are changed, so that only those who are observing the Torah are heirs, then it is the original promise made to those who have faith that has been eviscerated, and this promise is a part of the Torah. Resisting this later switch in terms is therefore the only thing that continues to uphold the Torah and what it says in this early verse. However paradoxically, to uphold the integrity of the Torah as prophetic Scripture, that speaks of an inheritance in the world to come which arrives in relation to faith, that inheritance must not be narrowed down and connected only to those who later observe the Torah as a teaching. ([Location 5912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5912))
- Faith for Paul points toward Easter, speaking especially of Jesus’s faithful walk to the cross. So Genesis 15:6 is a prefiguration of the way that God has sent his Son to die and to rise for us, and through that event, to resurrect us all. That is something that upholds the entire point of the Torah, and not a set of rules, irrespective of how helpful and inspired the latter might be. ([Location 5931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5931))
- Obedience to God is only possible in the new reality inaugurated by Christ through his faithfulness and resurrection and entered by the Spirit. It is this new state then, somewhat counterintuitively, without Torah (because it is beyond Torah), that upholds the Torah and its larger promise of life, and allows humanity to fulfill God’s expectations (see 1 Cor 7:19). ([Location 5945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5945))
- when we live out of the flesh that is rooted in the old world, instead of the new reality, which the teacher’s gospel of works appears to recommend, then we eviscerate the Torah because we are then vulnerable to the manipulations of evil powers and our lusts, and we transgress and sin. God’s anger is rightly elicited. ([Location 5948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5948))
- There are lots of reasons then, once one presses into Paul’s gospel, for claiming that “faith” upholds the Torah, while a primary dependence on works and rule-observance eviscerates it. ([Location 5950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5950))
- By leaning into Genesis 15:6, Paul has shown his Roman audience that boasting of achievements on the basis of deeds or works is indeed excluded; God’s deliverance is a generous gift correlated only with faith. ([Location 5953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5953))
- Moreover, circumcision is not mandatory and the circle of God’s deliverance is not limited to the Jewish people (although it is certainly meant to include them). ([Location 5954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5954))
- Finally, maintaining the connection between God’s promised deliverance and faith upholds the Torah in both a narrower and a broader sense. It respects this text and does not overrule it. And it affirms its all-important covenantal promises to the Jews of life by upholding the solution God ultimately offers to the problems of sin and death through the events of Easter. ([Location 5956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5956))
- the NRSVue and NIV lead their readers astray by translating it “. . . as righteousness.” It is rather difficult for the Greek eis to mean “as.” Our reading, “. . . with deliverance,” makes much more sense in relation to the underlying Semitism and Paul’s crediting language that we will talk about shortly. ([Location 5984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=5984))
- The account of trust in God that we see developed here by Paul in relation to Abraham is so extraordinary that it is simply not a realistic action for a sinful human to undertake in order to transfer from an unsaved to a saved state, which is to say, from Box A to Box B. If this is what Paul thinks faith is—and if faith is what we must generate for ourselves in order to be justified—then we are all doomed. No one can match Abraham’s heroic faithfulness as it is described here. ([Location 6000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6000))
- So emphatic was this promise God renamed Abram as Abraham, which literally means “father of many peoples.” ([Location 6064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6064))
- You were entirely focused on Abraham’s extraordinary faith, which began in Genesis chapter 15, continued through Genesis 17, and was vindicated in Genesis 21. This faith was obviously what really mattered, even in the midst of Genesis 17. How incredibly impressive it was! And how foolish to suppose that anything else crucial was really involved—anything as trivial as circumcision, which was merely a seal on that faith! ([Location 6120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6120))
- But who can maintain their faith in God in relation to something utterly impossible for over thirteen years without a single moment of doubt? Most of us couldn’t maintain that posture for thirteen hours, assuming we were able to believe at this level at all. And yet this is the picture of faith that Romans 4 supplies us with. The strength of this faith is exceptional, and not something that sinners like us and you can conjure up for ourselves. ([Location 6154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6154))
- But there is a figure who did display this level of steadfast, steely endurance—who did not waver in unbelief for a moment, despite the suffering and death that lay before him, but gave glory to God. Jesus! And if Jesus possessed this faith, we can grow into this faith as he gifts it to us and we learn to walk in this way with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit. ([Location 6158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6158))
- In short, the extraordinary faith that Paul depicts in relation to Abraham suggests that Jesus lies behind his portrait as the only human being who could possibly share this level of fidelity. ([Location 6160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6160))
- It is a critical shortcoming on the part of JT that it has no room for the saving significance of the resurrection. All that needs to be done for salvation is effected in this model through an exchange between the Father and Son on the cross, by way of penal substitution. The resurrection is either an apologetic moment that “proves” Christ was the Son of God, or it is a vindication that declares Christ “in the right” before God. But neither of these approaches make sense of 4:25, where Christ’s resurrection is clearly liberating and saving humanity. ([Location 6193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6193))
- The resurrection of Jesus does critical saving and transformational work for Paul—and does so here, at the conclusion of the one of JT’s key texts. It is a final sign that the JT model is not getting Paul right. ([Location 6197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6197))
- this later material presents our solution with three specific challenges: (1) there are two remarks that connect Israel as a whole with “works” (9:31–32), possibly suggesting that Paul and not just the teacher views Jews prior to the coming of Christ as defined by legalism and “works”; ([Location 6220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6220))
- (2) one remark could state that Christ ends or terminates the Torah, which appears to dovetail with JT’s forward-thinking and its erasure of Jews and law-observance in the church (10:4); and ([Location 6223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6223))
- (3) a long account of faith through chapter 10 is often interpreted as Paul’s further emphasis on the all-important condition for salvation that an individual needs to meet through their own efforts from within Box A to transfer to justification in Box B—the “decision” of faith! ([Location 6224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6224))
- As we read on it then becomes clear that when Paul looks at the state of present Israel he sees this rejection bringing two types of “righteousness” into view. ([Location 6246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6246))
- One type is the singular, saving act by God effected through Christ. God acted to save and to resurrect through this dramatic “right” act on his part. ([Location 6247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6247))
- On the other side, Israel is pursuing their own alternative system of achieving righteousness and salvation that is necessarily—one would have thought—less effective. Hence, we see now very clearly that when people reject the gospel as presented in Box B, they automatically end up in some form of Box A, trapped in a system of their own manufacture. Box A is all about our own ideas about how we can get saved. ([Location 6252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6252))
- Many pagans have accepted Paul’s teaching, and yet many Jews have rejected it. Surely this is bizarrely anomalous? God’s own people have turned their backs on their own God, yet those who are not God’s people have embraced him, and done so in a way that effectively by-passes the great gift to God’s people of the Torah? The basic absurdity of this situation calls Paul’s entire program into question, the teacher is suggesting. ([Location 6278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6278))
- Think about how we would feel if a so-called apostle turned up today and proclaimed a Bible-lite “gospel” that the vast majority of Christians in the church rejected. Imagine further that a vast number of non-Christians accepted this “gospel” and proceeded to become Jesus-followers, yet had scant interest in the Bible, leaving it behind as “unnecessary.” Many Christians would find such a situation immediately and completely unconvincing. So the teacher has a point as he places the equivalent scenario in his day for Jews in front of Paul. ([Location 6281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6281))
- Paul: “What are we to say then [in view of all I have just said]?” The teacher: “Pagans not pursuing righteous activity have received righteousness?!” (v. 30a) Paul: “—the saving righteous act [of God] ‘through faith.’” (v. 30b) The teacher: “But Israel, pursuing a torah of righteous activity, toward the Torah, have not?!” (v. 31) Paul: “Why? Because they did not strive for it ‘through faith’… ([Location 6287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6287))
- To catch what Paul is doing here we need to press into the imagery he is using. The motif of “striving” and “pursuing” is prominent, and this operates within the broader context of Greco-Roman athletic imagery, which is focused here specifically by Paul on running a race. We should recall at this moment that Paul’s Greco-Roman culture was as athletically obsessed as ours is. Appeals to… ([Location 6296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6296))
- this imagery lends itself easily to the gospel of the teacher. For the teacher, the truly righteous need to be involved in constant practice, running, and effort, guided by the Torah, to receive the future prize of resurrection offered on the day of judgment. The athletic metaphors of training,… ([Location 6300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6300))
- It is highly likely then that he was using this imagery to make appeals to Paul’s converts, potential and actual, couched in terms of athletic training and seriousness, and that these further highlight the apparent anomalies… ([Location 6303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6303))
- “God’s athletes, the Jews, who train and work and compete, are, according to you Paul, not actually going to get the prize, but those who sit and watch, the pagans, who are not athletes, not trained, not involved—who are useless bystanders—are going to get the… ([Location 6305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6305))
- First, from verse 30, Paul accepts that the pagans are not actually running at all. They are not participating in a race, striving for the prize of righteousness through their own efforts like the teacher says that the Jews are. Nevertheless, true righteousness—which is God’s saving act of deliverance through Christ’s… ([Location 6310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6310))

- It is as if Israel is being trained by the Torah and is striving after the Torah, with all its might and main. The Torah is the entire focus of the race. But Paul now points out, if this is the case, then the Jews are heading in the wrong direction, and this is a crucial assumption on his part. They are pursuing the Torah when they should be pursuing Christ because only Christ will award the ultimate… ([Location 6317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6317))

- According to Isaiah 8:14, which is quoted here,227 Christ is a stone laid in Zion. This might seem odd at first glance, but the Hebrew for “stone” and for “son” was so close (eben and ben) that Jews could pun on the similarities. And so many early Jesus-followers who knew their Scriptures well applied “stone” texts to Jesus because he was God’s “son.” Having said this, here the Son of God, Jesus, is the stone foretold in Isaiah, which is also a stumbling stone—a stone that trips people up. ([Location 6330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6330))
- We cannot work our way to heaven, training and striving like athletes, because our moral nature is incapable of such training. We are too far gone. As the great philosopher Immanuel Kant once put this, we are made from crooked timber, and the teacher’s gospel wants to build a house that needs huge beams of timber that are perfectly straight. ([Location 6341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6341))
- So the teacher’s “gospel” really asks people to help themselves when they cannot—a constant problem for the entitled. Such optimism is really thinly disguised cruelty. ([Location 6343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6343))
- It might also be worth noting here that by affirming this approach to salvation, the teacher anticipates the great problem of Pelagianism, while Paul’s response anticipates the insights of Augustine.228 Corrupt and depraved humans need liberation before they can be asked to act in the right way and to train hard in virtue. ([Location 6345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6345))
- Paul’s statement that Christ is the telos of the Torah here has led to much scholarly conversation about whether he means “end” or “goal,” the Greek telos being capable of both meanings. Is Paul saying that Christ terminates the Torah? This would have very serious implications for the ongoing existence of Jews, especially messianic Jews. (This would be what JT advocates expect though.) Or is he saying that Christ is the goal of the Torah? ([Location 6355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6355))
- If we introduce the racing imagery from the context that we have just been discussing, however, it seems fair to suggest that he can be simply speaking of the “goal” of the Torah in the sense of the finishing line of a race toward which people are supposed to be running. The telos or goal of the Torah is Christ, as Paul also said in Romans 3:21, and has demonstrated with frequent citations throughout the letter. ([Location 6359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6359))
- we see here the assumption on which the subversion of the athletic imagery from 9:30 onward is based. Everything turns on Christ being the center of God’s activity and the goal of the Torah. He is the real finishing line, and he comes as a gift, at the behest of the electing God. If you miss this then you’re running the wrong race in the wrong direction. ([Location 6363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6363))
- reading telos in this sense alone allows us to retain the space that Paul seems to keep open so carefully elsewhere for Torah-observant Jesus-followers in the early church. The Torah is not completely gone. It is just not an end in itself. And if it is a part of a discipleship aimed toward the Messiah, then it is a fine and good thing. ([Location 6366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6366))
- First, as we have just emphasized, the goal to which Torah points is somehow enacted through Jesus, not through the Torah itself (10:4a). And, second, ultimately those who believe are saved, so any pagans who believe are legitimately saved, and any Jews who don’t are not (10:4b; see also 9:30–32). ([Location 6382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6382))
- It follows that “live” in both these quotations denotes eternal life. So this sentence is addressing how we get saved, which for both Paul and the teacher revolves around the question of how we get resurrected and thereby enter into the age to come.230 And in the light of this we confirm that Paul is suggesting in verse 4 that the goal of the Torah has always been to give its recipients life. It is focused on saving them and consequently on resurrecting them. ([Location 6394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6394))
- resurrected Christ fulfills the Torah. God has given us resurrection life through him. The promises of an eternal inheritance made to Abraham and to all the other patriarchs and matriarchs are thereby fulfilled. ([Location 6400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6400))
- The “working your way to heaven” approach advocated by the teacher and stated in verse 5 is clearly wrong. The correct approach has something to do with faith. But it also has something to do with Scripture, and with the Torah, as Paul will go on to argue. Moreover, the Jewish people have to accept that they have rejected their God, who has reached out to them with outstretched arms. ([Location 6404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6404))
- It is universally admitted that it reaches those who believe. It is they who will receive “deliverance” and “salvation.” This is why the believing pagans are saved and the unbelieving Jews are not. We all should respond, at the least, by believing that Jesus really is the one sent to resurrect us. ([Location 6424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6424))
- But the $64,000 question is how we all believe. What mechanism is in play linking the work of Christ, who was resurrected, with the promised resurrection of those who believe? ([Location 6426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6426))
- JT offers us an account of this argument that is again too “thin.” The model only knows of the faith of individuals, and, moreover, they generate this faith for themselves. So JT readers suppose that Paul is simply speaking of a basic saving contract here. Those who choose to believe will one day be rewarded by God with resurrection and salvation—and the logic underlying this easy saving contract that offers resurrection in response… ([Location 6429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6429))

- We hold that Christ plays a much more powerful and active role in Paul’s argument, joining hands with the Spirit, ultimately to provide us with a much more persuasive account of how God saves and resurrects us. Moreover, it is also a more comforting and reliable account! We certainly still… ([Location 6435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6435))
- recall the key statement in 10:6a again as we do so. But the righteousness that comes “through faith” speaks in this way. . . . . . . But what does it say? “The Word is near you,     in your mouth and in your heart” (the Word about “faith” that we proclaim). That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart,… ([Location 6439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6439))
- The first instance contains the intertextual cue from Habakkuk 2:4 that we have encountered many times already in Romans (ek pisteōs or “through faith”), which we know is an allusion by way of that Scripture to Christ’s faithfulness, death, and resurrection life.231 And reading verse 6 Christo-centrically is supported by the two references to Christ in the Deuteronomy quotation in verses 6b and 7 that immediately follow. Paul is talking about Jesus’s death and resurrection here. Once we have made these connections, we can then see that “faith” in the phrase “the… ([Location 6454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6454))
- we are encountering once more, although in a more expanded form, the faith progression that we have encountered in several other places earlier in Romans, from the series “through faith to faith” in 1:17, to the slightly expanded series in 3:22, to a broader analysis in much of chapter 4, which moved easily from the faith of Christ to the faith of others.232 (And there are some similar texts in other places in Paul’s letters, like Galatians 3:22.) There is a broad movement within the text… ([Location 6462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6462))
- The presence of this verbal phenomenon should not surprise careful readers of Paul’s broader argument. The “word of God” was a key player as he began his all-important sketch of the origins of Israel in the patriarchs and matriarchs in 9:6. The word is active again in verse 9, creating Isaac, and then in verse 12, calling Jacob and Esau into being. And in verse 24, after a suitable proof of its legitimacy, God “calls” followers, presumably using the “word” again, not only from among the Jews but also from among the pagans. But perhaps this is all just what we would expect after the way exactly the same thing happened in Romans 4:16b–22, where God’s words accomplish what they say they will. ([Location 6473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6473))
- There is then a key actor present here alongside Christ and his believers—a divine word. This word speaks the words of Scripture and reaches right down into the depths of people. And it works through Paul’s words, eliciting both hearing and believing. Paul’s reliance on a divine word operating dynamically through his own words is also evident in some of his other letters. ([Location 6479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6479))
- In 1 Thessalonians 2, for example, we read: We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God’s word, which is also at work in you believers. (1 Thess 2:13) ([Location 6482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6482))
- And in 1 Corinthians 2 he writes in a very similar vein: My speech and my proclamation were made not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God. (1 Cor 2:4–5) ([Location 6489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6489))
- From which it follows that we speak . . . in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual. . . . (1 Cor 2:13) ([Location 6496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6496))
- This word is the speech of the Spirit then, who is the creative and dynamic power and presence of God reaching into every corner of the cosmos. So the Spirit can reach right down into the depths of humanity, bearing its divine information and insights as it does. ([Location 6501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6501))
- the Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ for Paul, molding and shaping God’s people into the image of God’s Son, a son who was faithful and obedient to the point of death, and then raised from the dead and enthroned on high. ([Location 6503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6503))
- Once we realize that the word in context is the word of God, which is to say, the divine Spirit, spoken by the Father, and that the Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ, the Son of God, shaping us in his image, Paul’s argument comes into sharp focus. ([Location 6509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6509))
- the Spirit is now drawing those who are willing and responsive into him, drawing them into his image or shape, so that they too now evidence the same faithfulness as he did. Their faith is not just a copying then, or a pale imitation of Jesus’s. It is concretely connected to it. It is Jesus’s faith as the Spirit takes from what is Jesus’s and imparts it to his followers. Our believing is a sharing in Jesus’s perfect believing. It shows that we are connected together. ([Location 6512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6512))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- it is this connection that guarantees that the journey of faith will result in life, which is to say, in life from the dead. Those who believe bear the sign—and even the seal Paul might say—of their concrete connection with the one person in human history who has already been raised from the dead. So their own resurrection is guaranteed. (And the Spirit is indeed the seal on God’s possessions, denoting them as his, waiting for the future day of complete redemption.) ([Location 6516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6516))
- Those who believe in the one who raised Jesus from the dead and enthroned him as Lord are channeling Jesus who believed pretty much the same things. This is a place where the character of Christ peeps through into our lives. But as we well know, he is now in glory—and so that is where we are as well! ([Location 6520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6520))
- Moreover, we can possibly now better understand Paul’s confidence that this is what the Torah was always all about. The Torah points constantly away from death and sin and toward life; it carries the all-important promises to Israel of eternal posterity and inheritance with God. ([Location 6522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6522))
- So its central concerns are emphatically fulfilled by the risen Jesus and his introduction of his followers into the glories of the age to come. ([Location 6524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6524))
- First, we know by now that Paul’s use of faith is principally about Christ and his faithfulness, which has irrupted graciously and righteously into the cosmos, and then human faith as an inclusion within that person of fidelity effected by the Spirit. That is how the progression works. ([Location 6535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6535))
- So 10:6–10 begins by focusing on Christ’s story—his death, resurrection, and enthronement—recounted in verses 6–7 and 8b. The story then continues as Jesus’s followers join his journey, believe in and confess his lordship, and wait for their resurrections. ([Location 6537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6537))
- Second, just because the structure of verse 9 is conditional at the grammatical level does not entail that it speaks of a conditional theology, although we can see this more clearly once we have left JT’s expectations behind. ([Location 6539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6539))
- These verses are simply saying that if A (belief and confession in this fashion) is present, then so is B (salvation), in just the way that if a bird with a flat yellow beak waddles, quacks, and swims, then it is a duck. The sentence is factual! The bird didn’t choose a flat yellow beak, waddling legs, a quacking voice, and so on. ([Location 6541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6541))
- What we do learn from the conditional grammar is that Paul is correlating belief and confession with salvation. If belief and confession occur, then one is saved. We can be completely confident of this. ([Location 6543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6543))
- that means that any pagans whom the teacher is trying to threaten can stand firm fully assured that they are on track for salvation. They do not need to be bullied into Torah-observance out of anxiety that they will not be saved on the day of judgment. ([Location 6545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6545))
- The teacher: “But how are they to ‘call’ on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to ‘believe’ in one whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him? And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent?” (vv. 14–15a NRSVue modified) ([Location 6558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6558))
- Paul: “As it is written, ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!’” (v. 15b) The teacher: “But not all have obeyed the good news.” (v. 16a) Paul: “[And] for this reason, Isaiah says, ‘Lord who has believed our proclamation?’ So then, belief comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.”(vv. 16b–17 our translation) The teacher: “But I ask, surely they did not hear?” (v. 18a our translation) Paul: “Indeed they have: ([Location 6563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6563))
- Paul’s point here is to emphasize further, using Israel’s Scriptures, contra the teacher, that much of Israel has specifically and knowingly rejected Christ. God’s “Yes” has come near in Christ, but unbelieving Israel has said “No” and has instead chosen to establish their own way of salvation. Messengers have been sent and have not been believed. Their message has been heard and understood. But it has not been obeyed. Fortunately, this awful situation is not the end of the matter. ([Location 6585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6585))
- The teacher: “I ask, then, surely God has not abandoned his people?” (11:1 our translation) Paul: “Of course not! I am an Israelite. . . .” (11:1 our translation) ([Location 6589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6589))
- while Paul does hold Israel accountable in the present for their lack of response to Christ, Paul will not allow the issue to end here. Just as God’s electing purposes triumphed over pagan ignorance in 9:6–26 and 30, so too they will ultimately triumph over Israel’s rejection. No one gets the last word but God in Christ. ([Location 6595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6595))
- Paul, that is, views our faith in participatory terms (of course!), and so holds that our faith derives from Jesus’s faith, just as all our virtues derive ultimately from Jesus—our love from his love, our holiness from his holiness, and so on. ([Location 6641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6641))
- every now and again Paul speaks of faith twice in a series or progression, with the first reference pointing toward Jesus, and the second to us. His point is that our faith, which is important, derives from Jesus’s. But ([Location 6643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6643))
- you will have in your hands a Paul who makes sense. He is possibly simpler than you have been taught, but also, more importantly, he is more deeply and profoundly in the grip of a God of love, and that is the point of our book. Paul attests with great power and clarity to a God who loves us so much that he offered up his only beloved Son for us. It is a wonderful message. ([Location 6649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6649))
- Everything for Paul begins with God: the God who has disclosed himself to us through his Son, Jesus, and folded us into that disclosure with his very own Spirit. ([Location 6655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6655))
- We emphasized that we learn through this process that we are being embraced by a God who has loved us from before the foundation of the world, and who will love us to the end, and even beyond it if necessary; we are involved with a God who never lets go. ([Location 6656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6656))
- So it makes all the sense in the world that this God has personally reached into our current state, which is riven by sin, corruption, and ultimately by death, to carry that state to its end on the cross, so that he can rise again, beyond it, and thereby create a pathway to draw us into a new existence—one that is cleansed, renewed, and glorified. (Hallelujah, we murmur.) ([Location 6658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6658))
- This is the Pauline gospel, attested by the creeds, and it really is good news. ([Location 6660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6660))
- It followed from this realization, quite quickly, that Paul’s Box A texts were a direct attack on the teachers’ legalistic approach to salvation—and these particular messianic Jews were legalists, although there is no need to attribute their moralizing views to the rest of the Jewish people. So these texts do not represent Paul’s position at all, although they are certainly a clear statement of what he was against. ([Location 6691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6691))
- His rivals were an early anticipation of Pelagius, and recapitulated the unintentional cruelties of the Pelagians by exhorting people to undertake moral activity and be judged on that basis when their sinful nature could not help but fail them—a position that appalled the more Augustinian Paul. ([Location 6694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6694))
- A sophisticated argument for assurance was apparent as well, the faith of Jesus’s followers attesting to their participation within the faithfulness of Jesus himself. ([Location 6698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CRXJMJ66&location=6698))
