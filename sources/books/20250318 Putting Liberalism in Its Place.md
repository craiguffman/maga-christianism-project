### Highlights

- Every age has its own point of access to ethical and political deliberation. For us, that point is the problem of cultural pluralism. Lacking a conviction in the absolute truth of our own beliefs and practices, we are uncertain how to respond to those who live by different norms. We are all too aware that such differences exist, as we interact with cultures that put different values on life and death, family and society, religion and the state, men and women. ([Location 43](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=43))
- We constantly confront the question of whether some of the practices supported by these values are beyond the limits of our own commitment to a liberal moral philosophy and a political practice of tolerance. We worry about moral cowardice when we fail to respond critically, and about cultural imperialism when we do respond. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=47))
- The problem is both theoretical and practical: theoretical, when we struggle to find a form of reasoning that can occupy a position between a discredited claim to universal moral truth and an incapacitating moral relativism; practical, when we must decide how to respond to groups and individuals that offend our own values. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=49))

- The problem of cultural pluralism has both an internal and an external face. Internally, we confront cultural differences within our own society. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=52))
- More importantly, differences arise because of contemporary critiques of traditional practice and beliefs. These critiques purport to expose the manner in which the traditions carry forward entrenched status relationships. Is the traditional family, for example, a cultural inheritance to be treasured and preserved, or does it perpetuate gendered role differentiation and patriarchal values that should be rejected? Is religion a source of values to be protected or of irrationality to be cabined? Is ethnicity a legitimate or an illegitimate source of political difference? Confronting this internal pluralism, we wonder how much normative difference can be absorbed by a single political culture and what common principles can hold together a multicultural society. ([Location 54](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=54))
- Differences between ourselves and others are not mere matters of degree or of interpretation of common standards. Rather, we have radically different understandings of the appropriate social norms and, consequently, very different expectations of politics. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=62))
- We are forced to think critically about our own claims for universal norms. We are no longer quite so confident of the status of our own truths. We find Islamic states today—and even a Jewish state—but we do not find Christian states. The contemporary truths of the West are procedural and economic: the rule of law, democracy, and free markets. We wonder whether any of these constitutes adequate grounds for rejecting the moral truths of others. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=69))
- We appeal to the idea of human rights—“It is the law,” we say—but beneath the legal rhetoric we find disagreement about the nature of the individual and his or her relationship to the community. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=72))
- Western states, including our own, have traditionally been quite willing to force people to comply with moral truth. The theoretical project, in the form of theological and philosophical inquiry, was to defend and elaborate that truth. Once the truth was grasped, there was no more difficulty in making it compulsory than there was in making individuals follow the rules of mathematics. As long as the good and the true were believed to be one and the same, moral science had the same status as natural science. Even as tolerant a country as our own has a past marked by little toleration for deep religious difference (consider the treatment, at various times, of Mormons, Catholics, and Muslims), for claims of racial and gender equality, or for the beliefs of non-Western immigrants and Native Americans. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=75))
- Across a broad domain, we have tolerated difference. Toleration for some religious differences is deeply embedded in American history. Free speech, too, rests on a principle of liberal tolerance for difference. Intolerance appears at the margins of a field of tolerance. Those margins have moved substantially over the course of our history. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=81))
- As a matter of law, we protect certain fundamental rights. Individuals and groups are free to live as they wish, as long as they respect fundamental norms protective of individual dignity. This still leaves a wide range within which ordinary political forces, as well as individuals, make choices among competing norms. At times, certain values or norms become so important that they shift from the domain of choice to that of constitutional law; that is, they are taken out of the ongoing political and moral debate and protected as a matter of fundamental law. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=85))
- Our own liberal political culture, in these cases, is uncertain where to draw the line between uniformity and toleration. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=96))
- A tolerance based on respect for choice easily becomes a reverse image of itself: intolerance for the actual choices made. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=101))
- Theoretical approaches to the problems of cultural pluralism reflect a similar conceptual aporia between universalism and tolerance as competing first principles. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=103))
- We can articulate a set of universal values and supporting norms, against which cultural practices and belief systems are to be measured. This is the approach pursued by contemporary advocates of human-rights law. Alternatively, we can begin from the perception of difference among groups. The intuition of difference is no less fundamental than that of commonality. This is the approach of those who perceive in human rights discourse a neocolonial, Western enterprise. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=104))
- On the other hand, an approach that begins from the perception of difference can quickly dissolve into an extreme moral relativism. In this extreme form, there is no foundation from which one can gain sufficient purchase to make any compelling criticism of different cultures. Every criticism is thought to rest on a particular community’s values; there is no way to make cross-cultural comparisons of value. To condemn another’s practices is simply to produce a kind of tautological affirmation of one’s own values. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=110))
- From the fact of difference, nothing follows about whether to accept it or reject it. There may be no common ground upon which to justify condemnation, but neither is there a common ground upon which to justify acceptance.9 Intervention may be an imposition of one’s own values, but failure to intervene may be a violation of those values. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=114))
- The problem of cultural difference is not like that of difference among cuisines, in which each culture values some distinct set of flavors and tastes. Rather, different cultures affirm values that others reject. Some reject what others insist upon as a matter of right—for example, gender equality. Affirmation and rejection are not abstractions. They invoke passions and these passions run into each other, sometimes in a violent way. Societies may be defined by their hatreds as much as by their attachments. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=121))
- It is often difficult for Americans to know how to react to these social hatreds. Not only our religious traditions but also our political culture pursues a practice of proselytizing. Other people never appear as permanently alien; they appear instead as the object for our efforts at conversion. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=125))
- Our contemporary missionaries preach democracy, free markets, and the rule of law—all institutions founded on our belief in the equality and liberty of every person. This dogged commitment to a universal community is a product of both our Christian and Enlightenment traditions. We experience this commitment simultaneously as a kind of open-ended love and as a faith in the capacity of each individual to enter a rational debate that will result in mutual agreement. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=131))
- No one, we believe, is beyond conversion to our values. When we dream of a global order, we project our own values onto it. We do not imagine that the global community of the future will be led by an Islamic cleric. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=134))
- Other cultures do not necessarily share this proselytizing attitude toward the alien other. They do not pursue a universal mission of either love or reason. Difference, for them, may not be understood as a problem to be overcome, but as a border establishing identity. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=136))
- Ours, after all, is an era marked by the simultaneous, but opposing, development of globalization and ethnic nationalism. From the latter perspective, Western universalism may appear as yet another form of cultural imperialism. For the West, the story of colonialism was one of Christian proselytizing and the progress of civilization; it was simultaneously a project of imperial destruction. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=138))
- Individual moral autonomy may be a bedrock first principle for us and an immoral denial of the primacy of a community of faith for others. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=145))
- As long as we focus on difference itself, we cannot solve the problem. We will alternate between a rhetoric of the universal and a rhetoric of the particular, each of which can collapse into the other. Proving yet again that liberalism follows from a certain understanding of the autonomy of the moral subject is hardly a convincing argument to those who accept neither that view of the subject nor the primacy of reason among the possible forms of argument. But for those who find that autonomy an obvious and undeniable first principle, no claims by the other—whether the parishioner, the communitarian or the multiculturalist—will shake that faith. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=146))
- Our ambition must be to create a space from within which to assess our own normative beliefs and practices, which include, but are hardly exhausted by, liberalism. This is not a neutral space from which to judge others, nor a space from within which we can pursue a program of reform. Its end is neither to make others like ourselves nor to… ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=153))
- Cultural pluralism is not a problem to be solved, as if we could finally articulate the right set of universal values or the appropriate scope of the particular. It is, instead, a warning that normative inquiry can no longer take the… ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=156))
- The assumptions within which liberalism operates generate the familiar oppositions that have dominated modern political theory, including that between the universal and the particular, the public and the private, and reason and interest… ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=162))
- fails to see. Most of all, liberalism fails to see the way in which citizens committed to American political culture occupy a meaningful world. It fails to see what I will describe as the erotic foundations of modern political life. We cannot understand the character of the relationship between self and polity without first understanding love. To understand love, however, we need to… ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=165))
- This linking of will to love, and both to meaning, expresses the Christian inheritance of our political tradition. This is Christianity not as a source of religious doctrine but as a form of understanding of self and community. Much of this study is an effort to explore the way in which our political life draws as much upon the Christian tradition of love and will as on the Enlightenment tradition of reason. Modern American political practices and beliefs have achieved a kind of stable synthesis of these two sources. That stability, I will argue in the conclusion, is under considerable stress today as the erotic conception of the citizen’s body is… ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=169))
- Many of the tensions in contemporary political life, and particularly the tension between the United States and its European allies, arise from the fact that Americans generally remain embedded in a modern conception of the… ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=175))
- To understand our own political culture, we need to begin by putting liberalism in its proper place. To put liberalism in its proper place, I need to emphasize, is not to put liberalism down or to dismiss its norms. I take for granted that most of my readers share—as I do—a commitment to basic liberal values. These include respect for the dignity and equality of individuals, a skepticism toward fixed hierarchies, broad acceptance of diverse social groupings whether religious or ethnic, a demand for representative government limited by a doctrine of individual… ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=177))
- To put liberalism in its proper place is to take up the question of the nature of the unity of the political community—in particular, of our political community. It is to turn from the rules of governance to the character of political meaning. Charles Taylor usefully labels this distinction as advocacy versus ontology.14 Taylor notes that to criticize liberalism’s understanding of the nature of the subject (the ontological perspective) does not commit one to a similar criticism of liberal politics (the advocacy perspective). In his terms, this is a work in political ontology. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=189))
- The pursuit of liberal norms as a matter of advocacy may really have a tendency to build citizen character in the way liberals conceive of the self—as an autonomous subject who applies reason to individual choices. Conversely, belief that community relationships are constitutive of individual identity may lead to the advocacy of traditional values. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=200))
- I will speak of the rule of law and political sovereignty. The rule of law is the normative ideal of a liberal politics: it guarantees individual rights against the state, organizes and limits the exercise of state power, and provides the conditions for market transactions. Issues of advocacy concern the content and character of the norms given expression and life in the rule of law. Rights, markets, and limited government are transnational norms. The liberal discourse of law easily becomes a universal discourse, that is, the rule of law is not bound to a particular political space. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=207))
- Political sovereignty, on the other hand, is always bound to a particular community temporally and geographically. Claims of sovereignty reflect a community’s understanding of itself as embodying a distinct set of meanings that are substantive not formal, realized at a particular historical moment, and limited to members. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=211))
- Traditionally, sovereignty was thought to precede law in two senses: first, the sovereign is the source of law; and second, sovereignty defines a political community, establishing the jurisdictional reach of law.15 This is the sense in… ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=214))
- we will never understand the character of the American rule of law without first understanding the way in which it is embedded in a conception of popular sovereignty. More importantly, we will not understand the way in which the nation-state presents itself to the citizen as an ultimate value,… ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=217))
- Liberal thought, as well as liberal politics, believes claims for sacrifice are exterior to the purposes and functions of a legitimate political arrangement—a kind of unfortunate, historical accident. I will argue that recognition of the possibility of sacrifice is at the base of our experience of the political and an… ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=220))
- To speak of sovereignty—in the American case, popular sovereignty—is to speak of a relationship of meaning between the citizen and the community considered as a unified, historical subject. Our liberalism operates within this politics of meaning, but liberal theory lacks the conceptual tools by which to grasp this context. It lacks these tools because of its broad privileging of reason. It believes that political commitments as well as political order can and should be the products of reason… ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=223))

- A religious analogy can help to clarify the distinction between law and sovereignty. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, God speaks the world into being. There is a difference between God’s speaking and what it is that He says. To understand the religious experience of the world, we cannot simply dismiss the belief that it is God who spoke; we cannot concentrate only on the content of that speech. For Americans, the polity has its origin in the speech of the popular sovereign. That the sovereign… ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=231))
- Liberal theorists generally do just that: they focus on the content of the speech, that is, on what it is the sovereign said or should say. They do not reflect on the significance of the belief that it is the popular sovereign who does the speaking. If the idea of popular sovereignty arises at all, it tends to be equated with majority rule. That conception, however, is hardly adequate to the transhistorical idea of a people creating and maintaining itself. Voting is… ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=235))
- In considering the problems of cultural pluralism, we have been the prisoners of liberalism. The approach of liberalism to difference has been to assume that the thinner the… ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=240))
- We will have greater success in understanding the significance of cultural conflict if we start from the opposite end. A thicker description of our own normative order will put us in a… ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=241))
- But self-awareness is a necessary condition of avoiding the cultural imperialist’s mistakes of the past—mistakes made even with the best of intentions—as well as the mistakes of that particular… ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=244))
- Different liberal philosophers interpret these assumptions differently, and they assign different weights to different aspects of this core. Still, none would place faith above reason in the construction of public norms; none would affirm that some individuals are worth less than others; and all agree that individuals must be relatively free to set for themselves their own conception of the good. Liberal theorists believe in the primacy of autonomous individuals who share a capacity for rational deliberation but do not necessarily share a common set of interests. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=248))
- Apart from their commitment to autonomy and dignity, liberal theorists also see a world of individuals competing under conditions of moderate scarcity to satisfy their own interests.17 Scarcity means that individuals of necessity share a common world; they must regulate themselves and deal with others. Unless individuals can take up the perspective of reason, which means temporarily to bracket one’s own immediate interests as a source of direction for the will, there will be only competition and chaos. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=255))
- To bracket interest and pursue the common perspective of reason is not, however, to abandon the self. For reason expresses that virtue of the self most emphasized by the modern, liberal theorist. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=258))
- work in political theory of the last fifty years. Many of my examples of liberal attitudes will, therefore, be drawn from Rawls, supplemented by other prominent liberal theorists, including Habermas and Ackerman. All three stand squarely in the Enlightenment tradition, with its faith in reason’s capacity to generate a just public order. All three are particularly concerned with the role of reason as public discourse in the liberal polity. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=266))
- Liberalism is a political view that rests on a moral epistemology. It combines a theory of reason and a conception of interest to construct a political world divided between the private and the public. My ambition is to put liberalism in its place by juxtaposing to it other normative strands of our culture that I hope the reader will sympathetically recognize. It is, in other words, to shift the point of reflective equilibrium in a way that allows us better to comprehend the place of liberalism in our self-understanding. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=277))
- My most fundamental claim is that liberalism lacks an adequate conception of the will. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=280))
- The will is the faculty by which, or through which, we understand ourselves as participants in a meaningful world. This is not a world of abstract ideas, but rather one in which ideas are always attached to particular subjects. The domain of this conception of the will is history, which refers equally to a meaningful past and a significant future; it is neither the timelessness of reason, nor the present of interest. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=292))
- We are most familiar with this conception of the will in its Christian form: the will is the faculty that makes possible the experience of grace. This is the will as a capacity to experience an ultimate or transcendent value as an historical experience in the world. Neither reason nor interest provides access to a world that shows itself as an image and product of the divine. Through the will we do not transcend the world, yet we find ourselves in a world of transcendent value. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=295))
- In our own revolutionary-constitutional tradition, we project this conception of the will onto the popular sovereign. The sovereign will, we say, is the source of law, and indeed of the nation itself. To identify with the popular sovereign is to understand the self in and through will. It is to read the self—quite literally the finite body—as a point of access to, and expression of, the nation, which confronts us as an ultimate value. This is never a matter of abstract reason or of the particularity of interest. Neither can account for our sense of the nation as a unique historical actor, nor of ourselves as participants in this political project that has both a privileged past and a necessary future. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=298))
- The world constructed by the will is miraculous; it is one in which every object can take on an infinite value. This is a world of faith, which liberal theory sees only as a threat to the order of reason. While liberal theory would cabin faith within the domain of the private, this cannot be true of the faith that holds together the public world of politics. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=307))
- Religion, politics, and love all demand an understanding of the will that is simply unavailable in the liberal tradition. The reason at the center of liberalism rapidly becomes a demand that one’s actions and one’s demands be reasonable.22 Reasonable means moderate and reciprocal: one must offer fair terms of cooperation to others, which requires a willingness to abide by a common set of standards. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=310))
- A will in thrall to the infinite is not easily bound by the reasonable. Neither religious belief nor love is reasonable. Neither, in the end, are our political practices. They too are founded on faith. In all of these cases, we are claimed in ways that cannot be contained by the reasonable. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=313))
- Politics, even the politics of a liberal state, remains a deeply erotic phenomenon. The state makes a claim upon us that we perceive as one of ultimate meaning. Quite literally, we can be conscripted by the state: it can demand of us that we sacrifice the self for the maintenance of the political community. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=315))
- To understand what is at stake for us in the current controversy over multiculturalism, we must confront some very unliberal experiences of the self and the polity. This is not a work for the faint-hearted liberal who lacks the ability to push him or herself beyond the polite boundaries of rational discourse, on the one hand, and the individualism of interest on the other. My aim is to bring us face to face with an idea of the politics of the will that presents an ultimate value and demands of us that we be willing to sacrifice. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=321))
- A liberal conception of interest must be set within a richer understanding of love, just as the liberal conception of politics as contract must be set within an understanding of politics as sacrifice. Love and sacrifice are the terms within which we conduct a meaningful life. Politics hardly exhausts the domain of love and sacrifice, but it does compete with other understandings of the self within love’s domain. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=326))
- Some may object that those sources include the thought of that most illiberal of political philosophers, Carl Schmitt. Schmitt’s categories of friend and enemy, as well as his insistence on the autonomy of the political, are useful tools in exploring those aspects of political experience that are beyond the reach of liberalism. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=338))
- groups around the world. By bringing liberalism into contact with Schmitt, I mean not to undermine liberal practices, but rather to expand our horizon of under-standing. Schmitt can be read as celebrating a violent politics, which he took to be a more authentic experience than ordinary political practices. I think our politics continues to demand sacrifice, and it is all too often violent. I don’t, however, celebrate these aspects of our experience. Nevertheless, I do insist that we confront the character of our political faith. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=345))
- Our faith in popular sovereignty does not make us indifferent to the liberal content of the rule of law. Law and popular sovereignty exist in a reciprocal relationship. Our faith in the popular sovereign is to some extent a function of the law it speaks. Were the law to appear to us regularly to violate our deepest moral commitments, we could lose faith in the popular sovereign. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=348))
- our faith in popular sovereignty makes us broadly tolerant of a legal order that never quite meets our moral standards. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=352))
- While the structure of Schmitt’s theory of the political offers a useful set of concepts, the content of his theory is not similarly useful. He believed that sovereignty had to be based on some prepolitical conception of a people’s substantive homogeneity. The recent rise in ethnic nationalism is surely a warning that there are still real dangers in this direction. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=354))
- But American political experience has been directly to the contrary. Here, the popular sovereign brings itself into existence in the distinctly political acts of revolution and constitutional construction. Our conception of popular sovereignty has had to be adequate to a nation of diverse immigrant groups and diverse faiths. For Americans, popular sovereignty is always linked to the rule of law. Indeed, apart from revolution, the only act of which the popular sovereign is capable is the making of law. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=356))
- Conversely, all law must show itself, directly or indirectly, as the speech of the popular sovereign. Without that, what purports to be law is only “action under the color of law”; it is unconstitutional. More than theory is at stake here, for if we allow liberalism to block our view of this political experience of popular sovereignty, we will not comprehend the nature of the law in what may be an emerging American Empire. Nor will we understand our deepest disagreements with our old European friends or our new enemies. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=359))
- internal dimensions. I am aware that my argument is not easy to follow. Our liberalism is a cultural practice drawing on a vast amount of conceptual material—philosophical and theological—that is itself a part of a larger,Westerncultural practice. It is also a response to very specific historical conditions. I explore the historically contingent character of that which appears to be a priori truth for us: the autonomous character of the individual, the privileged place of reason, and a government that respects the distinction between the private and the public.

- The multiculturalists have succeeded the communitarians in the role of critics. Together, communitarianism and liberalism took up two sides of a single antinomy of meaning, which understands the subject as simultaneously bound to and transcending context. Liberals systematically privilege one side of this antinomy; communitarians the other. The same antinomy is at issue today in the debate with the multiculturalists.

- Chapter 2 offers a genealogy of the practice of American liberalism. I explore the resources out of which American liberalism is constructed and demonstrate that these actually support two different forms of liberalism: a liberalism of faith and a liberalism of speech. These point in quite different directions: one privileges the private, the other the public; one privileges the particularism of faith, the other the universalism of reason. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=390))
- American liberalism has had to maintain an awkward relationship with an experience of our politics as a source of ultimate value. Liberalism has served as a kind of creed. Every creed derives its symbolic energy not from its specific content, but from the identification of the individual with the underlying social reality. As Americans, we are liberal. It is not because we are liberal that we are Americans. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=395))
- Chapter 3 takes up the results of the inquiry into the historical a priori and asks whether they can form the basis for a stable and adequate conception of politics. It focuses on the role of reason in delineating the public order and the distinction of the private from the public. These critical elements of the liberal project are shown to fail: the discourse of reason becomes a discourse of the body; the political always seems to bridge the private and the public. The conceptual apparatus of liberalism is incommensurate with the experience of the political. Liberalism offers a theory of political order, but liberalism cannot understand the conditions of the political upon which it depends.

- Third, liberalism refers to a political culture that has neither the sophistication of a theory nor the partisanship of a political party. This is the sense in which we speak of American political culture—or, more generally, of the West—as liberal. Liberalism in this third sense characterizes values and institutions both private and public; this liberalism provides the context within which both liberal theory and liberal partisanship operate.

- Nevertheless, my concern in this work is primarily with the third level: liberalism as a cultural phenomenon. By this I do not mean culture in the sense of popular culture, but in that broader sense in which our law, our political rhetoric, and our political philosophies all contribute to an expression of who we are and what we stand for. Literature and art, as well as popular culture, also operate here. My point of access to our liberal culture, however, is through law, history, philosophy, and religion.

- Chapter 1 describes that architecture as a set of dichotomies: reason/unreason, autonomy/heteronomy, public/private. Liberalism provides a normative ordering within each pair by privileging the subject’s capacity to separate self from context and to re-form the self on the basis of deliberative choice. The opponents of liberalism, on the other hand, privilege context over choice—that is, the already formed self over a critical capacity for reform.

- Chapter 2 traces the genealogy of American liberalism deep into the Christian past. That past extends well beyond the idea of religious liberty that emerges out of the sectarian wars of the Reformation. Liberalism carries forward the deeper idea that ultimate truth is to be found in a turning away from politics. That turning away of the soul—toward God—is the source of liberalism’s radical egalitarianism. But if liberalism bears the imprint of Christ on the cross, it equally bears that of the church, which offers the first and most successful paradigm for linking institutional expression to an ideology.

- Chapter 3 completes the inquiry of part I by taking a more critical stance. Having elaborated the architecture and genealogy of liberal belief, I argue that there is a disequilibrium between those beliefs and the character of our political practices and beliefs. The fundamental categories of liberalism do not help us to understand the character of our own experience of political meaning. The consequence of this disequlibrium is not just the unresolvable debate between communitarians and liberals, but a similar sort of unsettling dialectic among all of liberalism’s fundamental concepts: the private/public distinction, and the separation of reason from interest. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=565))
- the end of liberalism is to create a form of public discourse in which these differences would have no significance. This is the ambition behind the effort to theorize from the perspective of Rawls’s original position. From the point of view of this imagined discourse, differences are literally of no interest; they cannot even be seen. But, of course, they are exactly what is of most interest from the point of view of an individual life. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=579))
- Excluded are any references to one’s family, religion, or community—or even to one’s conception of oneself as a unique subject with specific ambitions or a life plan.3 Nothing can be said that could not be said by everyone: “[S]ince the differences among the parties are unknown to them, and everyone is equally rational and similarly situated, each is convinced by the same arguments.” ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=583))
- Anyone who cannot strip himself down to this position of bare rationality and undifferentiated need is excluded; he is “unreasonable.” Unreasonableness appears as nothing less than a form of prejudice. Worse, it is an intolerant privileging of the self, which is the source of all prejudice. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=587))
- The person in the original position is everyone and anyone because he is no one in particular. He is nothing more than a capacity to express reason itself. Reasonableness, one might say, is a transcendental condition of the individual who is a citizen of the liberal state. A reasonable person is ready to imagine himself in the original position, from which he will rationally derive the basic conditions and structures of fair cooperation in the society. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=594))
- Toleration, on this approach, is not the outcome of a discursive encounter among diverse individuals or groups.8 Rather, the boundaries of toleration are already present before any differentiation is even recognized. The result, however, is that we never get beyond the starting point. Liberal theory becomes a closed circle of discourse among those already committed to liberalism—in Rawls’s terms, among those who maintain comprehensive doctrines open to the demand of reasonableness.9 Theory can help to elaborate the demand sand obligations that liberals should recognize in their mutual dealings, but it has literally nothing to say to those whose beliefs are illiberal. Awareness of radical difference may prompt the inquiry, yet the inquiry itself never seems to get to the point of recognition of just those differences.

- The ambition of contemporary moral and political inquiry, however, must be to orient action and thought when differences are beyond the capacity of reasoned discourse to overcome.

- The critics of liberalism argued that normative theory need not begin behind Rawls’s “veil of ignorance” or with any other effort to obtain “the view from nowhere.”20 It begins there because of an intellectual tradition that puts forward the autonomous subject as the central ideal—the foundational norm—of the moral order.

- To exercise choice as an autonomous, rational agent requires at least an imagined withdrawal from every relationship within which the subject finds him or herself. Existing relationships become authentic only when, and if, they are reaffirmed through choice. Life becomes a project made and unmade through the exercise of choice. Choice is valuable just to the degree that it produces an “examined” life. Thus, the autonomous individual frees the self from the unexamined irrationality of tradition.21 Context is evaluated by the autonomous chooser,and the source of that normative scrutiny is reason. Reason, of course, cannot determine the content of every choice. But where reason ends, we say the choice makes no difference to the moral quality… ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=657))

- The communitarians reject the primacy of rational autonomy in the domain of moral theory; they are skeptical of the ambition to deploy reason to manage matters of belief, faith, or value. We do not have to approach moral deliberation, they tell us, as if we constantly confront an open future to be determined by an act of individual will. The normative domain includes as much a regard for the past as for the future; it involves narrative as well as reason, realizing the already existing truth of the self as much as exercising… ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=668))

- Individuals never appear for themselves alone, but are always already tied to others—family, friends, fellow citizens, or coworkers.24 The corresponding epistemic move was to deny the Lockean model of sensation on a blank slate and to begin the explanation of knowledge from within the language that we already use to order all our experience.25 Morally and epistemically, the individual is not the beginning of experience but a product of distinct forms of community self-understanding. We know the whole before we know the part—even if that part is the self. We find ourselves already in a world, and there is no self apart from that world. Each of us is located in a community—actually multiple communities—that are substantially constitutive of who we are.

- Citizenship, however, is just such a privileging of some over others. The liberal subject is universal; he or she is not defined by membership in a particular community. Liberalism warns not only against the false necessity of seeing one’s present self as the limit of one’s possibilities, it also warns against the false limit of seeing geographic proximity as a measure of one’s concern for the lives and well-being of others.37 ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=742))
- Yet the distinction between citizen and noncitizen is the fundamental inequality of political life. This inequality is defined both geographically and historically. The dual sources of this political inequality are represented explicitly in the dual sources of citizenship at birth: bloodline and geography, or ius sanguinis and ius soli. These derive from Roman law, not liberal theory. Liberalism adds the idea of the “naturalized” citizen who obtains through consent what otherwise works without reference to choice. But except under extraordinary conditions—for example, emigration to the New World—this liberal contribution never adds much to the constitution of citizenship.38 Actual communities severely restrict the opportunities for naturalization, privileging those who have no claim of right but for the accident of their births. Our political communities, even our liberal communities, are overwhelmingly founded on “blood and soil.” ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=747))

- The former constrains the state in order to preserve a domain, or domains, of ultimate meaning beyond the state.

- The latter takes no position on the locus or existence of ultimate meanings. Instead, it places its faith in reason itself. This approach builds a conception of legitimate political order from the ground up. Paradigmatically, it imagines a prepolitical moment at which potential citizens come together and establish the terms of their political interaction through a mutually agreed upon discourse.

- No longer confident that God is the foundation of meaning, the modern liberal turns to speech. The liberalism of speech imagines a moment of pure speech that organizes the state. It can imagine this as a hypothetical moment of origin or as an aspirational ideal. The key proposition is that each speaker will only enter into a political relationship in which all the others respect her as a speaking, that is, reason-giving, subject.

Instead, culture rests on something akin to faith. From this perspective, the virtue of the liberal state is that it preserves the conditions under which cultural diversity can be pursued. If individual meaning and personal virtues are to be found primarily in culture, then the state’s first obligation is to protect the cultures that groups bring to the state.

- The liberalism of speech will pose the same threat to minority cultures that it has posed to minority religious groups: it will treat them as just another group of speakers in the political marketplace. Just as the liberalism of speech tends to understand religion as irrational speech, it tends to see the claims of culture as a dangerous source of irrationality. On this view, politics draws to itself the modern values of reason, progress, and deliberative self-construction. Claims for culture, on the other hand, are seen as potentially regressive forces if allowed to enter the public sphere.

- Barnette translates religious faith into just another form of speech to be tested in the forum of reason, which is the classroom as metaphor for the state itself. Religion now appears as only another source of potential error or of private prejudice that the enlightened speech of the classroom is to confront. The ritual act of patriotism is not the pledge, but the debate. This is the liberalism of speech, which believes that public discourse is both the source of political order and the means of sustaining that order. The faith upon which the state is built is not a faith in the supernatural, but a faith in the citizen’s capacity to exercise reason.

- Christianity announces that all of these are nothing: history is about to end, geographical borders are irrelevant to the community of the faithful; fame, wealth, role, and status count for nothing in the kingdom of heaven; family and class determine nothing; and there is no earthly power that can overcome death. The power of faith cannot be inherited, transferred, or sold. To the Christian, it makes no difference who your parents are or which position in society you occupy. Christianity first appears as a religion of the poor, the outcast, and women:those without political power. The fundamental metaphor of Christianity is, accordingly, rebirth—to be born again in the community of the church, which is the body of Christ. The church is without temporal or geographic boundaries. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=1423))

- This idea that the church and the state exist in separate dimensions has a troubled life as each sphere tries to coopt the other to its own purposes. Because the church is concerned with the salvation of all, it cannot be indifferent to political actions that it believes may cause ruler or ruled to exist in a state of sin. And because religious motivation and belief are so extraordinarily compelling, political rulers cannot be indifferent to the support that they could potentially obtain from the church. To attack the church risked civil war, but to coopt the church held out a promise of greater security: These two opposing forces provide the motivations through which we can read much of European history. This is a history of a struggle among separation, hegemony, and cooptation. We are hardly done with this struggle today, as we witness a renewed political activism of religious groups as well as efforts by government to deploy religious institutions to further the social-welfare policies of the state.

- The ideas of separation and resistance, of the monkish retreat to a life in prayer, and of potential martyrdom continued as sources of critique within Christianity, even as the church pursued its own political ambitions. This is a unique resource of the West. Separation of church and state enters the Western imagination not as an expression of a philosophically justified, secular politics, but as an aspect of religious belief. It includes not simply an idea that the state poses a danger to religion, but equally the opposite idea that religion poses a threat to the state because it reveals the insubstantiality of the concerns of the state and the limits on the state’s power over the individual. The state’s power is ultimately the power to threaten life, but Christianity begins with a sacrificial act that undermines that threat by announcing life to be death, and true life to lie beyond death.

Its origins reach deep within the substantive character of fundamental Christian belief. It comes from the Christian idea that religion is fundamentally a turning of the soul toward God, and thus a turning away from the things of this world. All of the varieties of Christian sects make a direct claim on the founding experience of Christ. All carry forward the same language of martyrdom.

- Yet to believers the point of the church is to give historical life to a truth that always appears beyond and above any particular institutional expression. The church’s authority flows from its capacity to present that meaning to its own members. Institutions, ritual, and doctrine are all ways of translating the immediacy of the experience of transcendent faith into finite historical forms. The relationship between the particulars of church practice and doctrine, on the one hand, and the transcendent meaning that founds the church, on the other, is surprisingly immediate.

- In the modern period, the popular sovereign steps into this position of an inexhaustible source of ultimate meaning: the sacred source behind and beyond any particular political expression, whether doctrinal or institutional. There may be competing understandings of the basis of national sovereignty—for example, civic or ethnic nationalism—but regardless of these differences, the state is the historical and institutional expression of a meaning that always transcends its institutional expression. The institutions of political order gain their symbolic meaning as expressions of the sovereign, yet they never capture completely the fullness of sovereignty. Political life is not exhausted in either the forms of contract or coercion. It is never exhausted in the present; it maintains a sacred past and opens up the possibility of a national destiny.

- The origins of the modern Western state are not in the social contract, but in communities of political faith. The state is the contemporary institutional form within which that faith takes a geographical and temporal shape. State borders that fail to match the borders of a community of faith—that is, that fail to cohere with a recognition of national sovereignty—generally fail or there develops a matching conception of sovereignty.

- The church demonstrates the possible power of a politics founded on belief. There are no natural limits to such a community of faith. Its geographical reach is as broad as its ideological message is acceptable. Its temporal endurance is as long as the beliefs are sustained. The church also demonstrates the potential weakness of a belief-based political order. Power founded on ideological belief can be no more secure than the beliefs themselves. When belief fails, the collapse of the political order can be swift indeed. Moreover, the content of belief provides a ground of critique of those who would exercise power as the representative of those beliefs. Thus, while offering the promise of unlimited extension, the ideological foundation also limits power from within. A claim of religious authority is always vulnerable to critique by new “prophets” who claim to speak the truth of religious belief. A king who purports to rule on the basis of divine right is vulnerable to the criticism that he has fallen from God’s favor; a king who purports to rule as representative of the will of the nation is vulnerable to the critique that he is unrepresentative. A democratic polity will invest a tremendous amount of power in the person or persons believed to represent the people. But just this fact means that the representative is always subject to the criticism that he or she is not performing in a representative fashion.

- By the modern era, the people have become the new absolute. The people as a single subject are the source of ultimate meanings in and for the Western state. Revolution and constitutional construction mark the assertion of a power of the popular sovereign to destroy order by withdrawing the sovereign will and to create order by speaking it into existence. The state is founded on nothing more than this sovereign act of will, which comes from nowhere, and has no measure apart from the people’s self-expression. The created order of the state is “good” as long as the people look upon their creation and pronounce it to be good. When they find it otherwise, their violent act of self-destruction can be as “terrible” as that of God when he rendered judgment on Sodom. Ethno-nationalism becomes such a powerful force in the modern era because it answers the question of who the popular sovereign is. Civic nationalism counters with a different answer to this question.

- In one direction, liberalism traces its origins to the separation of religion and state; in the other direction, liberalism understands itself as situated within a state that is itself a successor to the church. This is the odd spectacle of bourgeois life in the modern West. On the one hand, the bourgeois demand the cultivation of civil society, under-standing this as the domain in which each individual is free to pursue his or her own interests and values. Liberalism protects the spontaneous self-regulation of civil society by erecting a series of barriers—legal rights—to state interference. On the other hand, the bourgeois inhabits the modern nation-state, which always threatens to make an ultimate claim upon the individual. No matter how large or important the private domain becomes, the modern nation-state always claims the authority to transgress the border of the private and to devote all of the available resources—physical, material, and personal—to the state’s vital interests. The bourgeois is also the citizen, and the citizen exists his entire life with the understanding that he and his property may be conscripted, that is, literally made into an instrument of the state.

The private as the satisfaction of desire appears now as “temptation,” rather than “necessity,” as in the Greek understanding.

- Even as the image of separation associated with the founding narrative of the colonies—that of exile—is a source of the liberal distinction between the private and the public, the early American experience of self-government gives a decidedly different cast to American liberalism. Because New England colonial communities are for the most part Congregationalist communities, they are self-governing communities from the start. Self-government may be a necessity in the wilderness, but here it was also a part of a religious practice that doctrinally resists claims of authority. Americans deliberately cultivated a form of private life that was simultaneously an expression of a common life: it was religious and it was democratic. The colonial New England “meeting hall,” for example, was both the church and the center of town governance. Identifying public authority with the state from which the colonists exiled themselves, self-government could appearas a form of private opposition to authority. Americans will need a new term for this conception of a community that stands opposed to public authority. That term will be “the popular sovereign” or simply “the people.” ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=1748))

Is a system of pluralist representation a means of moving seamlessly from a private order of interests to a public order of coordination among those interests?

The individual American can always start over on the other side of the frontier. This idea of starting over has the same ambiguity: it means rebirth within a Christian sect, but it also means a refounding of… ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=1816))

- First, the theocratic ideal of some early colonial communities was exceptionally vulnerable to the Protestant inclination toward the proliferation of sects. Whenever a new interpretive truth arose, founding a new community of believers, the resistance of existing authorities would be seen as an image of the British regime that the early colonists had fled. Early American authorities would be accused of being as intolerant as their English predecessors, recreating the danger that is always present when state and religion coincide.79 Because of this, American government tends toward an internal replication of the idea of separation that was the central theme of colonial foundations. Government separates itself from religion in order to preserve the conditions of private faith that earlier relied upon geographic… ([Location 1826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=1826))

- Second, public authority was also open to challenge from those who saw wealth as the measure of personal success, and economic opportunity as the meaning of the New World. Again, this theme transferred to early American life the experience of resistance to the authority of Britain. The colonists resisted efforts by English authorities to assert a power to tax. The same narratives of resistance were available to resist assertions of local, and eventually federal, authorities.

- Americans easily adopted the Lockean idea that government comes into existence in order to protect private property.

- Success in the market qualifies one for a political career because it has the same kind of character-forming effects as religious belief. If government is to pursue the public good, it must not become a means of private advancement. This requires leaders who have already become, either through faith or wealth, all that they desire to be. There is a deep distrust of the professional politician, but also of the “professionalization” of governmental positions, that is, a distrust of the idea that government employment can generate its own norms of behavior without violating liberal principles. We see in all of this a priority of the private over the public: the private is both the end of and the means for successful governance.

As Madison says in the Federalist Papers, “[i]f men were angels, no government would be necessary.”83 But in an emerging commercial republic, this theme that government is rooted in the corruption of the body can never quite succeed, for it shares this position with that alternative form of corruption of the religious soul: property and markets.

This can never be seen as corrupt; it is an inexhaustible source of meaning for the citizen and the state.84 It confronts ordinary experience as absolutely other; it is our sacred history. American political experience becomes an endless interpretive debate over the meaning revealed by the popular sovereign.

But what is not emphasized enough is that the displacement of the king by law was also a displacement of religion by politics. The king functioned as a political link to a divine order. In America, the sacred authority of the law is rooted in popular sovereignty. There is no further source of meaning; nor is there any need for more. The state under the rule of law becomes the center of a new civic religion of popular sovereignty that offers generations of Americans a common core of belief and an ultimate meaning for which they are willing to sacrifice themselves.

- Liberalism is more than a strand within this complex world view. It is a way of appealing simultaneously across all of these elements. It is a privileging of the private over the public, but without deciding between competing ideas of the private. It is a public morality for the state that always exists in opposition to civil society. Because we interpret the product of popular sovereignty through the device of reasoned discourse, liberalism is identified with reason itself. If it is the experience of reason, it expresses that which many hold to be most valuable in the constitution of the self. And, if that is so, the privileging of the private over the public is an order of values that liberalism itself always threatens to reverse. Finally, the tremendous emotional investment in liberalism as our public ideology reflects the ultimate meaning that we experience in the state itself. There is more at stake for us in liberalism than liberalism itself can grasp. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=1913))

This is the move from the liberalism of faith to the liberalism of speech, which I traced in the last chapter.

- We can, of course, disagree over the substantive content of justice. Within the broadly liberal tradition, there has been a deep division between utilitarian and deontological models of justice. Both modelsagree, however, that the end of justice is to impose the order of reason on what would otherwise be the disorder of individual interests. We are, in this sense, all children of the Enlightenment. Americans can most easily get a sense of this if they consider how hard it is to believe that the Constitution requires some irrational action. Indeed, the perception of a gap between the constitutional order and rational action often marks the beginning of a constitutional crisis. The most famous example is that of the early New Deal, in which the Court held unconstitutional key elements of Roosevelt’s plan for rational reconstruction of the economy.

- The paradigmatic institutional expressions of this liberal conception of the private are, first, the principle of religious free exercise—the state is to take no position on matters of religious belief; and second, the free market—the state cannot match material resources to desires. The state is to tolerate all religious variations, as long as they stay within the conditions of a liberal political order. Similarly, the state is to interfere in economic transactions only when it can identify a market failure. In both cases, the state’s regulatory reach goes no further than responding to externalities. The state does not generally have the capacity to allocate either spiritual or material goods. The soul remains beyond politics whether it is enthralled to God or the market.

- Berlin distinguishes negative from positive liberty. Negative liberty is the freedom to act without coercion by others; positive liberty is capacity to realize a substantive idea of the self. The former is that freedom pursued by a classically liberal political order. It aims to establish a protected zone, within which individuals are to make choices about where to invest themselves religiously, socially, politically, and economically. The trick of liberal political thought and governance has always been to create sufficient political authority to protect individuals from coercion without creating a source of illiberal coercion in the state itself. This is a politics in which no individual or institution has unchecked authority and in which individuals are protected by a strong doctrine of rights directed at both the state and other private persons. This ambition gives us the central structures of the liberal state: separation of powers in order to check governmental power; human rights to protect against the government; property rights and the criminal law to protect against other private persons. To this, modern liberalism adds democratic elections, but whether this is another check on the concentration of governmental power or a matter of individual right to participate in a structure of self-government is never quite clear.

- Berlin rejects any such notion of a single truth of man. Yet his analysis masks the degree to which liberalism is itself a product of reason and thus stands in this same tradition. No less than its competitors, liberalism too believes that reason should control the political order. It too believes that the privileged place of reason establishes an identity between citizen and state. Modern liberalism is not merely a regime of rights, but of rights embedded in a self-governing state. The end of all of our experiments in liberal constitutionalism is self-government. This is more than an institutionalization of negative freedom.14 The state’s establishment of a regime of negative liberty is simultaneously an act of giving the law to oneself: that is, an act of positive liberty.

- Reproduction, for example, has become a privacy issue. It is understood not as an issue of family, or as one of population policy, but as one of control over one’s body. Homosexuality too becomes a discourse over the disposition of the body. Similarly, we struggle today with the issue of the right to suicide. The body itself has become the ground upon which we stand in asserting rights against the state, as if only there do we find a foundation for choice beyond reason’s capacity for critique.39 There is, consequently, a flattening of the range of experience within the private—or, rather, a flattening of the understanding of experience. All that is not reason falls into a single category in which objects and actions get their value by virtue of the fact that they were chosen by a subject.

Objects and activities get their value from a competition among freely choosing individuals, none of whom need to—or even can—offer a justification of their choices.

- The liberal vision of love is that of an individual affair—a matter of private concern and choice. It sees love as a condition of a single subject—“to be in love.” It pushes love toward a contractual model of relationships. It thereby confuses love and desire. Liberalism is a political philosophy of a loveless world. This is a world in which the faculty of will operates only as the agent of reason or the vehicle of desire; it is not the soul’s opening to grace. Yet when we turn from theory to the experience of a public dimension, we find neither mind nor body, neither the universality of reason nor the particularity of desire. We find, instead, a meaningful world. Love has an irrepressible public dimension; love always founds a public order. The communities within which we find ourselves often make claims upon us to which we respond as if what were at stake were a part of ourselves. In their dispute with the liberals, the communitarians got this right. They did not, however, go nearly far enough in developing a language adequate to the experience, or one that could begin to make normative distinctions among and within these communities. To do so, we have to develop a conception of the will separate from reason and interest; a new conception of the objective value of a world realized by will—an idea traditionally linked to grace—and of sacrifice as the action of linking oneself to this world.

- A community of individuals linked through a will directed at God’s grace is no longer the deliberative association of ancient Athens. It is, instead, the church as the body of Christ. The realization of grace is not a matter of comprehending an object apart from the soul. It is experienced as a “new birth.” It remakes the nature of the body itself, which becomes a part of the miraculous appearance of the infinite. Christ is the paradigmatic moment of this identity of the finite and the infinite. Every reappearance of this miracle of meaning is Christ-like.12 This is the experience given expression in the church: a new form of community sustaining a new form of meaning.

- The state too must have a will, if it is to become a possible representation of the divine. Politics is no longer a matter of justice under the guidance of reason, but of faith within a community of those sharing a common will. This idea of a community of the faithful begins in the church, but becomes central to the Western concept of nationhood. A political community is not merely an organized structure for the development and deployment of reason. Its foundation lies in will, not reason. Modern political thought expressed this idea in the notion of “sovereignty.” The sovereign is the point of reification of the common will of the nation. The sovereign has will, not reason and not desire. Indeed, we come to the idea of the sovereign through that of the will:Because there must be a national will, there must be a subject in possession of that will. This is the sovereign.

They are likely to see popular sovereignty as a voting mechanism, rather than as an expression of a faith in a transtemporal, plural subject. They see a two-termed world of reason and interest.

- Despite the classical origins of this claim concerning the ordering power of reason, there has been a subtle shift, captured in the idea of contract. Contract suggests that each individual, as a contracting party, has reasons of his own to agree to the political arrangement. Those reasons, in their particularity, don’t affect the terms of the contract, but neither do the terms describe an order of reason independent of interests. Plato would strip the guardians of personal interests—the interests of the individual body—in order to have them embrace the political order of reason. But in the social-contract tradition, reason is seen as a mechanism of coordination—a means—while the motivating force for the particular individual remains interest. Individuals should agree to the social contract because it is in their own interests. This may require distinguishing long-term from immediate interests, but it does not require eliminating the ends of interest. The social contract promises a life that is more than short, nasty, and brutish—that should be enough. In contemporary terms, it promises to overcome the problems of social coordination by addressing the problem of defection.

- As I argued in chapter 2, justice inevitably comes to be valued in itself; its pursuit is seen as a good separate from the satisfaction of particular interests. The ambiguous value of the social contract—as a means and end—is a function of the double-appeal to interest and reason in its production. The oldest philosophical psychology we possess values reason in and for itself. The appeal to reason in the construction of the contract, even if based originally on the motive of satisfying everyday interests, will inevitably cross the boundary from means to end. The construction of justice on the basis of reason will appear to be a valuable project in and of itself—indeed, the highest value.

- Although these different conceptions of the self enter Western culture in different periods, the new never wholly displaces the old. Each struggles against the others. For example, economics is the leading social science today, reflecting the dominant place we tend to give the perspective of interest. Although much of our life is organized around market behavior, a prominent part of political and legal theory in the last generation has been an effort to recapture the civic republican tradition. That tradition reaches back to a classical conception of reason, in which political deliberation is valued not just for the correctness of its products—that is, its contribution to GDP—but also as an experience of common, civic engagement. We deliberate, not just to overcome our collective-action problems, but for the sake of realizing a common experience of virtuous action in the deployment of reason. The puzzle for many has been how to reconcile the reason of the ancients with the science of the moderns. Similarly, conceptions of will and grace that originated in Christian thought have hardly disappeared.

- Will privileges the narrative of self-creation of a particular community. There is no universal will, no will in the abstract. On this view, the origins of the political community represent a perfect state of grace, in which there is a complete transparency of the individual will to the sovereign will. This revolutionary community has a kind of transtemporal existence: all individuals—present and future—are participants as members of the popular sovereign. For this reason, the actions of the founders can continue to bind future generations: all are part of a single We. The atemporality of Christ has moved from church to sovereign monarch to the popular sovereign. Such a nation cannot be conceived on the model of reason or interest. It is the product of a revolutionary act of will that has become a self-validating source of revelation.

This does not mean that economics displaces the politics of the will, but rather that the construction of a narrative of the national will makes room for an account of markets.

In such a world of individuals with objectified interests, market norms become guides to political behavior.

- Those devoted to market models insist that they are metaphysical individualists; that is, all explanations must begin from the fact that there is only the individual. The image driving this form of analysis is the body itself, with its radical individuation and separation from others. These theorists do not worry much about a differentiation of faculties within the individual, because every faculty ultimately expresses itself in a market choice. Production within a market model has the same brute facticity as the body. The logic of the market is the aggregation of individual… ([Location 3084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=3084))

Rather, economics will dominate the conception of reason if we take up political psychology from the perspective of individual interests. We can imagine political circumstances in which other sciences would be the source of governmental decision making. If we were, for example, to approach political psychology from the perspective of a religious quest for salvation, theology would displace economics as the form of reason to which politics must be responsive.

- Will remains the representation of a subjective capacity to locate the source of meaning outside the self. Will, however, is now understood on the model of contract.

- If the task of politics from this perspective is to maintain market values and institutions, the problem of politics is its tendency to interfere with markets. Politics becomes a distrusted form of action because too often it is a form of rent-seeking. Today, when we consider globalization, we see a lag between the logic of markets, which tend toward a global reach, and politics, which for the most part remains community- specific. This bounded state is continually tempted to intervene in the global market in inefficient ways. The logic of markets is one in which the politics of nations is to yield to the management by experts. It is a world in which the WTO and the IMF replace the national parliament. Of this, we might say that “it is one possible future,” but it is not yet our present. Nor is it necessarily our destiny. Even some European states have resisted the Euro, despite its representation of the logic of the market. ([Location 3126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=3126))

- Is the source of value individual interest or self-transcendence? Do individual interests gain value through their satisfaction or their sacrifice? Is will the source of contract and property or the faculty of participation in a transtemporal popular sovereign? Is the work of reason economics or hermeneutics? These are familiar yet irresolvable debates in the nation’s law schools. The debates reflect larger conflicts within the nation’s political self-understanding, which seems to move endlessly back and forth between a pride in American exceptionalism and a demand for lower taxes. The former makes prominent the collective memory of a unique history; the latter aims to put more discretionary power in the individual consumer who is seen as the ultimate source of his or her own meaning.

Second, the Kantian idea of giving the law to oneself through the appeal to reason, explored in the previous chapter, is a paradigm of justice.

- From the perspective of reason, the problem of the human condition is that we are embodied—we are not pure reason. The body will always present itself as irrational.

- The first strategy of reason, then, is to suppress recognition of interest and will, and only extend recognition to that which passes the test of reason. The second strategy is to allocate both interest and will to the domain of the private. Again, we see reason dealing with what it perceives as the recalcitrant irrationality of the body, which is now cabined, rather than suppressed. To the degree that will and interest prove impenetrable to reason, a domain of the private is recognized as the proper place of man’s inevitable irrationality. Because it is defined by this impenetrability to reason, the private has an incredibly broad sweep. It contains both the trivial desires of the body and the confessional community of the church. It includes both the familial domicile and the marketplace. All that unites these vastly different enterprises is their rejection of reason as the measure of value.

- Nevertheless, here these three different normative perspectives provide the shape for many of our deepest political dilemmas at the level not just of national policy, but equally at that of the individual and the global. Consider the multiple norms to which the individual citizen feels drawn. He or she simultaneously affirms the virtues of participation in public deliberation over the character of justice, of satisfaction of interests through participation in a well-functioning market, and of responding to a call for sacrifice for the maintenance of the state. At the international level, we affirm the justice of universal human rights, the appeal of transnational markets, and the importance of state sovereignty. The problems here are not just those of incommensurable values. Each value stands upon an entire metaphysics that grounds a political psychology. We live simultaneously in distinct universes, that is, among diverse symbolic forms. There is no neutral perspective, no reality, separate from the forms themselves.

- From the perspective of will, the future always poses a threat of corruption, of a falling away from the meaning that created and sustains the community. From the perspective of reason, this fear of change is nothing less than submission to the dead hand of the past.

- Liberals tend to think that the post–Cold War international order has transcended the state, which appears increasingly anachronistic in a global order of rights and markets. Reason, on this view, has triumphed over will. That vision is very far from the reality in places like the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and the postcolonial order of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is, I believe, equally far from the continuing reality of American politics and self-understanding.

- The classical accounts of family and polity resist two moves essential to liberalism. First, they do not begin with the individual as the elementary unit of explanation. Second, they resist the division between the public and the private. For the liberal, the problem is to generate the public out of a private world of individuals. The private, on the other hand, needs no explanation. The consequence of these dual assumptions of liberalism—that of metaphysical individualism and the primacy of the private—is a failure to understand the character of love. Thus, altruism is always a puzzle for liberalism. It is explained away as either a personal desire of some individuals or a rational act despite contrary appearances.

- the democratic community is often one with an intense sense of its own way of life, that is, it “stands for something,” and sees that meaning challenged by an enemy.

- Politics is a way of seeing the world that is as tenuous—and as tenacious—as any other symbolic form. It does not take much, just a slight change in the angle of perception, to see the world in a way in which political meanings disappear.

- The fundamental moral message of the West is that there should be no killing: “Thou shalt not kill.” But the politics of the West has been a long story of killing and sacrifice. ([Location 4400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=4400))
- The effort to displace politics by morality is a constant ambition of well-meaning people. But measuring politics by morality makes as much sense as measuring art by morality. These are different ways of perceiving meaning in the world; they work in different dimensions. While each can displace the other, neither can be reduced to the other. These are simply incommensurable. ([Location 4404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=4404))

- The most basic right in the liberal state is the right to life. This is the point from which Hobbes would construct the entire political order; it is the premise of Rawls’s original position as well. ([Location 4423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=4423))
- Yet, there is something politically naive about liberalism’s privileging of life itself. This flies in the face of the obvious character of the political as a specific domain of meaning constructed by the imagination. That set of meanings only begins with the threat of death: not the natural death of old age, and not the death brought about by violence. Rather, the political begins when I can imagine myself sacrificing myself and killing others to maintain the state.

- Nowhere in the liberal accounts of the state does anyone die. There is only protection from the state; there is no dying for the state.

([Location 4433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=4433))
- To see sacrifice as the core of the political strikes the liberal theorist as characteristic of fascist political theory. But even liberal political orders rest upon an understanding that the state can call upon the individual to kill and to be killed. States disagree over the content of the political way of life, but they do not disagree over the state’s right to call upon its citizens to defend that way of life.

- If the political is an imaginative construction that begins in an awareness of the possibility of sacrifice, then politics cannot defend itself on the grounds of reason. Neither should it have to. Politics is a way of being in the world for subjects who are neither pure reason nor pure interest; nor are they some uneasy combination of the two. The political imagination can be reduced neither to the abstract reason of rights, nor to the maximization of satisfaction. It is a way of being for subjects who imagine themselves as citizens.

- The political imagination presents a distinct form of self-understanding. Traditionally, politics has had its own discursive form: rhetoric.

- The key move in this deduction is to characterize an entitlement possessed by some group as a right: for example, due process, employment, food, shelter, medical care.

- Once we agree on the rights, then the deduction follows. This creates a Whiggish view of history that understands political development as the extension of rights where they had not previously been recognized.28 This same distinctive logic appears in the administrative character of the modern bureaucracy. Administration consists in the extension of a set of legally defined rights to a population, the members of which are similarly situated with respect to the rights at issue. That extension is not to represent judgment with respect to the creation of a right, but only the perfection of the internal logic of the already established right.29 If application is to take a deductive form, that same logical form provides a ground for criticism of the work of those who are to administer rights. Courts are to hold administrative agencies to this test: agencies are to apply, not invent, rights. ([Location 4463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=4463))

Thus, when Martin Luther King Jr. proclaims “I have a dream,” he reminds his listeners that it is “deeply rooted in the American dream.” He claims for the black community their rightful patrimony from “the architects of our republic [who] wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” King’s dream would have us all children of this family, sitting down “together at a table of brotherhood.” To get there, King speaks of “creative suffering” in this struggle.

We speak of a failure, and seek remedial measures if the outcome of a legal dispute is driven by concern for the character of the parties.

- We do not ordinarily check the moral character of the agents with whom we pursue market transactions—unless we believe that character will bear on an issue of market performance. If we are concerned about the impact of market transactions on areas of life governed by other norms—for example, environment, health, or global justice—we have those concerns regardless of the particular character of the subject of a market transaction. Character is not a substitute for a concern with pollution. Because of this indifference to character, markets and legal rules tend toward globalization.

- Within a political perspective, however, we are concerned with questions of identity—our own, that of our political leadership, and that of our political rivals. Politics, for this reason, does not tend toward globalization. Or, if it does, it is likely to appear as hegemonic, an empire.

- The ideal subject of the market is one who takes an experimental attitude toward the self. This is obvious with respect to production: markets will not work unless individuals are willing to respond to market demands and opportunities. Markets require a fluidity of capital, human and fixed. The producer must maintain a certain distance from his or her capital if the market is to function properly. ([Location 5442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=5442))
- A similar fluidity marks the consumption end of markets. Individuals are to experiment in their spending decisions. Subjects seek to maximize the return on their purchasing power, which means that they must be open to competitive offers. The fluidity of consumer identity implies a reshaping of one’s own conception of the self over time. ([Location 5446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=5446))
- At the other extreme is the individual with minimal resources who is locked into a particular identity—a fixed job, perhaps, and a limited range of consumption choices. The wealthier the person, the more his or her personal life can take an experimental form. The wealthy can celebrate the diversity of identities that their capacity for eclectic consumption—of travel, cuisine, culture, dress, entertainment—makes possible. This class increasingly conceives of itself in global terms, while the poor may increasingly conceive of themselves in local—particularly urban—terms. The idea of a national political identity is under stress from both directions. ([Location 5453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WJM5PA&location=5453))
- on the Net itself experimentation seems costless. That experimentation can extend directly into personal identity. By making possible purely symbolic exchanges on a global and instantaneous basis, a literally free market is created. Individuals can consume and produce anonymously and endlessly; they can selectively enter symbolic exchanges revealing only a part of their identity or they can adopt new identities. The boundaries of self and fiction blur, because the cyberself has no being apart from the symbolic representation of itself.

- The cyberworld promises to achieve a postpolitical world: a world as close to that of the Greek gods as we are likely to attain. In this world, ideas have become information. Information only exists in relationship to other information: the network displaces the body as the locus of material existence.8 For this reason, cyberspace blurs the distinction between entertainment and work.
