The understanding which springs from grace and which co-exists with faith is incomplete understanding (intelligere imperfecte): In another way something can be understood imperfectly: this occurs when one does not apprehend the essence of a thing or the truth of a proposition, as to "what it is" or "how it is," but nevertheless one does apprehend that external appearances do not contradict the truth; that is, insofar as a person understands that because of these external appearances one ought not draw back from the things which belong to faith.109 What the believer understands through the Gift of Understanding, then, is not the nature of the Triune God or of the Incarnate Christ. What he understands is that the articles are to be adhered to on divine authority even in the face of considerations which seem to render them implausible (e.g. a being cannot be both three and one, or God cannot or would not become incarnate in His creation).
