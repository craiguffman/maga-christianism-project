What is Aquinas's point here? We must remember that miracle (miraculum) was a technical or quasi-technical term for Aquinas. As he says elsewhere in the Summa Ccntra gentiles, "Those things ... which are properly called miracles are those which divinely come to be outside the commonly observed order of things."49 Thus, when he speaks of the miraculous character of the assent of so many, he is drawing attention to the fact that their assent does not arise from the appeal of arguments to the UNO-natural intellect, but from the appeal of God's revelation to an intellect supernaturally illumined by. grace. It is because he thinks faith arises from this supernatural illumination and not from the acumen of the natural intellect that Aquinas mentions the assent of the uneducated and simple-minded, who assent "filled with the Gift of the Holy Spirit."50Read more at location 2415
