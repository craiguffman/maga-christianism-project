# (a) The way God orchestrates the unfolding of the world is his providential care, solely an act of God's will.  Note the Augustinian theme:  God's will precedes his foreknowledge.  So, too, with Aquinas.  God's knowledge is based on what God has willed the world to be.  For Thomas, the unfolding of God's providence (and will) is how he knows for he knows what he wills.  Analogy of a director who wrote the script and directed the actors.  Nothing happens by luck or by chance.    The entirety of the creation mirrors God and reveals some aspects of God.  Therefore God is going to will some people to be saved in order that some part of creation may display God's mercy.  But God suspends the gift of grace so that others are damned so that they may display God's justice.  God wills what to us seems like evil so that certain aspects of the divine may be manifest.
