# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  634

Now, in q.60 a.3, he explains the mysterious way in which the grace-filled Christ, head of the Church, is the sanctifying reality signified in sacraments.  He is a reality that is at once of the past, of the present, and of the future.  He became the one who sanctifies in his passion; he is now the one who sanctifies in giving the grace of the HS; he is the one who will bring ultimate sanctification in eternal life.  What is interesting about this understanding of sacrament is that it brings together signification and causality....once Aquinas has chosen to think about sacraments as “signs of a sacred reality sanctifying humans,” he is thereby thinking about them as causes: they are the reality of Christ, the one who sanctifies, in the form of sign.  The sign allows an encounter to occur between Christ and believers in which Christ is the efficient cause of holiness (which he became in his passion); the formal cause of human holiness (which he is as the unique image and measure of human grace); and the final cause of holiness (which he is as the culmination of the return of all things to God).  Christ’s causality in the sacraments reflects the threefold pattern of God’s causality to which I have drawn attention earlier: that it is efficient is more than adequately stated by the kind of language used about it; that it is also final and formal is an underlying postulate of Aquinas that is brought to light now and again, as it is here in his reply to the third difficulty of q.60 a.3.   p. 335
