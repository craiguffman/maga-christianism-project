"There is no single English expression which will serve as a wholly satisfactory translation of cognitio or cognoscere. In Aquina's writing these words seem to be generic terms for intentional, mental activity. In most cases, the terms refer to the apprehension, whether sensible or intellectual, of a thing or proposition. Thus, in what follows I will, for the most part, translate cognitio by apprehension and cognoscere by to apprehend.  LOC 224
