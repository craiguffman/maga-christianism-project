# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  635

The decision to define sacraments as signs of a reality that is actively sanctifying entails putting an accent on the “downward” sanctifying movement of sacraments.  I have already pointed out that this does not mean that Aquinas separates the “downward” from the “upward” movement of worship in his theology of sacrament.  But it does mean that he wants to think of sacraments as acts of God from the very beginning.  The whole weight of his theology of grace has to be brought to bear on his theology of sacrament....[Sacraments] allow God to act humanly in signs made by humans.  They are signs made by humans that allow God to act humanly.  In q.60 aa.4-8 Aquinas does some anthropologico-theological marking of the signs that make sacraments.  p. 335
