Since this is so, a person can have a theological virtue but lack the corresponding Gifts. Indeed, one who has faith and commits a mortal sin thereby loses sanctifying grace and loses the Gifts,86 but he need not thereby lose faith; he still may have what Aquinas calls "unformed faith."87 In what follows, however, when we speak of theological virtues we shall assume, unless otherwise indicated, that these are supplemented by the corresponding Gifts and the promptings of the Holy Spirit.
