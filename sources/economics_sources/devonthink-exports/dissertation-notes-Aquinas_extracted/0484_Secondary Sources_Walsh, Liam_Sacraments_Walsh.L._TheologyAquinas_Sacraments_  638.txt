# Walsh.L._TheologyAquinas_Sacraments:  638

The sacramental sign of baptism is not provided by water but by a washing with water (or immersion in it) of which the sacramental words determine the signification.  This is an important qualification of the matter/form analogy.  it might be canonically convenient to call water the matter of baptism.  But water signifies in the sacrament only when something is being done with it.  The words “inform” by saying what the action means, rather than simply what the water means....There is matter and form, and therefore a sacrament, only when persons are doing and saying something significant.  p. 339-40
