It can be noted here that, curiously enough, Aquinas's near-mono-physitism is much less fetishistic of the particular than Scotus's near-Nestorianism. For where Christ's integral specificity is God, and so also the universal, then it is a very strange sort of specificity which we can scarcely identify. Normally, the specific is framed by the universal; it is an item visible under the sun. But here, uniquely, the specific itself frames our vision of all other specificities: it is itself the very sun we see by. Its concreteness and particularity is therefore hyper-concrete—so concrete that its reality overwhelms all else, and its very over-apparentness renders it scarcely manifest at all as a discrete item. This circumstance—especially when allied to the disclosure of the Logos in the vulnerability of Christ (as will shortly be elaborated)—absolutely prevents any Christological encouragement of Christian triumphalism or exclusivity. The Incarnation sacralizes no one site, with a resultant secular draining of all other sites: to the contrary, its sacral reality tends to the proliferation of sacred sites as uncontrollable by any institutional force. By contrast, where, as with Scotus, Christ is allowed some independent merely human and therefore ontic existentiality, the very 'lowness' of this Christology ensures that Christ is reduced to a locatable human idol to be possessed and manipulated by a Church thinking of itself primarily as a legally-bound institution.Read more at location 1862   • Delete this highlight Note: This speaks to Hooker's ecumenism, and to his resistance to delimiting the church to the 'holy.'
