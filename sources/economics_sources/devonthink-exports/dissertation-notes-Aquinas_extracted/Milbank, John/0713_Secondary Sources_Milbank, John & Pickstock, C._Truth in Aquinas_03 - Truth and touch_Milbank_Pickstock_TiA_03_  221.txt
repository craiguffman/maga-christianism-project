Of course, this eminent ground of eventuality in God is none other than the issuing forth of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, which the Incarnation and the instituting of the Church fully disclose once again to fallen humanity. Through this disclosure we come to understand that there can be a created exterior to God, because God's interior is self-exteriorization. We see this because we now have seen that a created exterior can be entirely assumed into the divine esse without abolition, and yet without addition to the Godhead. But this regards only the ground in the Father's generating of the Son for his giving of the Creation. It reveals to us 'subjective relation' in God; it does not fully explain in what sense God can be eternally such as to be the subject of a new event which comes to belong to him, in the way that an organic instrument like a hand can come to belong to a person as something that is neither essential nor accidental. It does not fully explain how God becomes subject of this one-sided 'objective relation'. To understand this possibility, we have to grasp not only how esse is relational self-exteriorization, expressed as substantive relationality, but also how it somehow exceeds the contrast of given essence and accidental new additions. That is to say how the proper accident of the new organic instrument can come entirely to belong to God's being, and yet not add anything to this, nor be related to it.Read more at location 2274
