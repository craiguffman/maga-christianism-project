But what is the body a surface between? Clearly it can only be an interface between (informed) matter and the pure spirit (forma formaruni) of the soul.35 In effect, what Aristotle has already discovered here, long before Husserl and Merleau-Ponty (who, following Brentano, drew upon this text), is that the body is not just another object in the world of which we are aware. Rather, as the embodied condition of possibility of awareness, it is, as body, quasi-subjective, and is also the mysterious sphere of mediation between subjective and objective, psyche and hule. The mysterious character of this mediation is apparent in the fact that it is the body in its most earthly material aspect as the immediacy of touch (which is obviously related to 'efficient' causality), which serves as the transition to psyche. For it is the physical capacity of the body to mediate touch which actually proves for Aristotle that there is a spiritual, psychic interior to the body which allows it to be body. Thus: we touch things bodily; bodies, however, do not themselves touch, since then there would be no mediation and no touch; therefore it is the soul which touches through bodies. Touching proves and manifests the psyche. Or, to put this in more contemporary terms: in the case of touching, one is conscious in, but also through the body, of contact from without.Read more at location 1966
