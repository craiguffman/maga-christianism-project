### Highlights

- American capitalism doesn’t just shape U.S. history, it shapes world history. Although the all-powerful degree of that influence is “new”—a post–World War II phenomenon—the fact of it began even before the first bag of Georgia cotton picked by enslaved African Americans reached the Liverpool docks. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=134))
- since 1776, when the United States became the first postcolonial economy to launch itself into the struggle to develop and achieve prosperity. American democracy and American capitalism have grown hand-in-hand. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=137))
- For most of the readers who weighed in, capitalism is totally explained by either Karl Marx or Adam Smith (with the occasional John Maynard Keynes or Joseph Schumpeter tossed in). That is, capitalism is a system that can be universally explained through one theory or the other. Either you understand it or you do not. Either you read the right author or you are an ignoramus. In this view, the history of capitalism is simply the logical unfolding of a natural law, like an apple falling from a tree. As one reader put it, “a history of capitalism would be as revelatory as a ‘history of gravity.’ ” ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=156))
- to think about why capitalism, which appears to be so simple, evades easy definitions. And in the last decade, there has been a renewed interest among historians in not only challenging existing definitions, but in historicizing that very untidiness (much to the consternation of nominalists everywhere).

- My generation was shaped by all of those New Left social movement historians, taking race/gender/class as the essential lens. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=187))
- This type of history starts by assuming that people on the margins matter, that culture is essential, and that questions of gender and racial power cannot be divorced from questions of class. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=189))
- Simply showing that capitalism had changed over time is in itself a major shift, ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=214))
- Capitalism is not the end of history—as Francis Fukuyama famously put it at the end of the Cold War—it is our history. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=215))
- confident that critical theory was still much hipper than math, even if the White House did not call us. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=221))
- After years of economic stagnation in the United States, we can no longer blindly accept the hypothesis that the free market is efficient in the long run. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=222))
- We are living in a time of tremendous possibility to fashion new ways of explaining the economy. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=230))
- what makes it compelling are its stories of real people doing things—sometimes really risky things. Policymakers decide to change regulations. Business leaders take risks in bold ventures. Workers actually manage to resist huge corporations. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=231))

- the most compelling history is about entrepreneurs who challenge market equilibrium and common sense. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=236))

- things change, even capitalism. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=239))
- While the basic rules of capitalism might appear fixed (excess profits ought to be invested, work needs to be organized, and private property needs protecting), the forms that are possible are quite endless. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=240))

- the riskiest investments of the early nineteenth century were factories, while normal investment went into merchant ventures. The trip could be insured. Multiple friends (and it was always personal) could be brought together to split a ship and a cargo, and after the trip, the ship could be sold and the profits divided. How could a factory be divided? When would its “trip” end? The longtime horizons just seemed too risky. If you wanted to invest in production, the safe bet was not factories, but slaves. Slaves could work. Slaves could have children. With the expanding frontier, slaves could be profitably sold. If one wanted to borrow money, slaves could be easily mortgaged, or even securitized.

- Agency, when we see it, is a problem to explain rather than an assumption. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MCTLNLW&location=253))
