### Highlights

- Capitalism, at least in its startup phase, detaches, in other words, the pursuit of profit from the end of happiness, and in that way comes to make money an end in itself and to counsel hard work for its own sake. No matter how much money one makes, one is never satisfied. Material needs may be met but that does not still the pursuit of more money; one always wants more of it, whatever one’s achieved state of happiness. Indeed, one is willing to defer the enjoyment of life—perhaps indefinitely—in favor of the hard work necessary to make more money.
