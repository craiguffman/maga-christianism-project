### Highlights

- Merchants bought raw cotton from around the world and took it to British factories, home to two-thirds of the world’s cotton spindles. An army of workers spun that cotton into thread and wove it into finished fabrics; then dealers sent those wares out to the world’s markets. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=96))
- They owned noisy, dirty, crowded, and decidedly unrefined factories; they lived in cities black with soot from coal-fueled steam engines; they breathed the stench of human sweat and human waste. They ran an empire, but hardly seemed like emperors. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=113))
- Instead of women on low stools spinning on small wooden wheels in their cottages, or using a distaff and spinning bowl in front of their hut, in 1860 millions of mechanical spindles—powered by steam engines and operated by wage workers, many of them children—turned for up to fourteen hours a day, producing millions of pounds of yarn. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=127))
- By 1860, the cotton capitalists who assembled to celebrate their accomplishments took as a fact of nature history’s first globally integrated cotton manufacturing complex, even though the world they had helped create was of very recent vintage. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=138))
- By 1960, most raw cotton came again from Asia, China, the Soviet Union, and India, as did the bulk of cotton yarn and cloth. In Britain, as well as in the rest of Europe and New England, few cotton factories remained. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=141))
- Cotton is in the banknotes we use, the coffee filters that help us awaken in the morning, the vegetable oil we use for cooking, the soap we wash with, and the gunpowder that fights our wars (indeed, Alfred Nobel won a British patent for his invention of “guncotton”). Cotton is even a component of the book you hold in your hands. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=178))
- For about nine hundred years, from 1000 to 1900 CE, cotton was the world’s most important manufacturing industry. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=183))
- would take approximately 7 billion sheep to produce a quantity of wool equivalent to the world’s current cotton crop. Those 7 billion sheep would need 700 million hectares of land for grazing, about 1.6 times the surface area of today’s European Union. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=201))
- Any reasonable observer in, say, 1700, would have expected the world’s cotton production to remain centered in India, or perhaps in China. And indeed, until 1780 these countries produced vastly more raw cotton and cotton textiles than Europe and North America. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=207))
- few strands of humanity in the late eighteenth century suddenly got much richer. Scholars now refer to these few decades as the “great divergence”—the beginning of the vast divides that still structure today’s world, the divide between those countries that industrialized and those that did not, between colonizers and colonized, between the global North and the global South. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=219))
- A focus on cotton and its very concrete and often brutal development, casts doubt on several explanations that all too many observers tend to take for granted: that Europe’s explosive economic development can be explained by Europeans’ more rational religious beliefs, their Enlightenment traditions, the climate in which they live, the continent’s geography, or benign institutions such as the Bank of England or the rule of law. Such essential and all too often unchangeable attributes, however, cannot account for the history of the cotton empire or explain the constantly shifting structure of capitalism. And they are often also wrong. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=225))
- first industrial nation, Great Britain, was hardly a liberal, lean state with dependable but impartial institutions as it is often portrayed. Instead it was an imperial nation characterized by enormous military expenditures, a nearly constant state of war, a powerful and interventionist bureaucracy, high taxes, skyrocketing government debt, and protectionist tariffs—and it was certainly not democratic. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=231))
- Such a thorough and rapid re-creation of the world was possible only because of the emergence of new ways of organizing production, trade, and consumption. Slavery, the expropriation of indigenous peoples, imperial expansion, armed trade, and the assertion of sovereignty over people and land by entrepreneurs were at its core. I call this system war capitalism. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=244))
- war capitalism, which began to develop in the sixteenth century, came long before machines and factories. War capitalism flourished not in the factory but in the field; it was not mechanized but land- and labor-intensive, resting on the violent expropriation of land and labor in Africa and the Americas. From these expropriations came great wealth and new knowledge, and these in turn strengthened European institutions and states—all crucial preconditions for Europe’s extraordinary economic development by the nineteenth century and beyond. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=249))
- When we think of capitalism, we think of wage workers, yet this prior phase of capitalism was based not on free labor but on slavery. We associate industrial capitalism with contracts and markets, but early capitalism was based as often as not on violence and bodily coercion. Modern capitalism privileges property rights, but this earlier moment was characterized just as much by massive expropriations as by secure ownership. Latter-day capitalism rests upon the rule of law and powerful institutions backed by the state, but capitalism’s early phase, although ultimately requiring state power to create world-spanning empires, was frequently based on the unrestrained actions of private individuals—the domination of masters over slaves and of frontier capitalists over indigenous inhabitants. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=258))
- War capitalism, then, was the foundation from which evolved the more familiar industrial capitalism, a capitalism characterized by powerful states with enormous administrative, military, judicial, and infrastructural capacities. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=268))
- was in cottons that new modes of manufacturing first came about. The factory itself was an invention of the cotton industry. So was the connection between slave agriculture in the Americas and manufacturing across Europe. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=276))
- As industrial capitalism spread, capital itself became tied to particular states. And as the state assumed an ever more central role and emerged as the most durable, powerful, and rapidly expanding institution of all, labor also grew in size and power. The dependence of capitalists on the state, and the state’s dependence on its people, empowered the workers who produced that capital, day in and day out, on the factory floor. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=288))
- By the turn of the twentieth century, the model of industrial capitalism had traveled to other countries and was embraced by their modernizing elites. As a result, the cotton industry left Europe and New England and returned to it origins in the global South. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=293))
- By 1900 about 1.5 percent of the human population—millions of men, women, and children—were engaged in the industry, either growing, transporting, or manufacturing cotton. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=341))
- If our allegedly new global age is truly a revolutionary departure from the past, the departure is not the degree of global connection but the fact that capitalists are for the first time able to emancipate themselves from particular nation-states, the very institutions that in the past enabled their rise. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=396))
- Cotton, we now know, thrives in areas in which no frost occurs for around 200 days, and in which it rains from twenty to twenty-five inches a year, concentrated in the middle of the growing period, a common climate zone that explains its abundance across multiple continents. Seeds are put in trenches about three feet apart and then covered with soil. It takes from 160 to 200 days for the cotton to mature. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=458))
- early as a thousand years ago, the production of cotton textiles in Asia, Africa, and the Americas was the world’s largest manufacturing industry; sophisticated trade networks, mostly local but a few regional, connected growers, spinners, weavers, and consumers. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=467))
- Biologists think cotton plants have grown on earth for 10 to 20 million years. Four genetically different species of cotton have developed since—the Mesoamerican G. hirsutum, the South American G. barbadense, the African G. herbaceum, and the Asian G. arboretum. These four species, in turn, have sprouted hundreds of further variations, of which only a few would come to dominate commercial cotton production. Today, more than 90 percent of the world’s cotton crop is G. hirsutum cultivars, also known as American upland. Human domestication has changed the plant even further. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=511))
- Farmers in the Indus valley were the first to spin and weave cotton. In 1929, archaeologists recovered fragments of cotton textiles at Mohenjo-Daro, in what is now Pakistan, dating to between 3250 and 2750 BCE. Cottonseeds found at nearby Mehrgarh have been dated to 5000 BCE. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=524))
- In what later became the southwestern United States, Native Americans became avid cotton producers, especially the Navajos and Hopi, perhaps as early as 300 BCE. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=584))
- In the Caribbean, as well, cotton growing was widespread. Indeed, one of the reasons why Christopher Columbus believed that he had reached India was that he encountered great quantities of cotton in the Caribbean; he recounted islands “full of…cotton.” ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=591))
- While China eventually became one of the most significant producers of cotton and cotton textiles worldwide, and is the center of the world’s cotton industry today, the plant is not indigenous there. Indeed, the Chinese word for cotton and cotton fiber is borrowed from Sanskrit and other Indian languages. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=643))
- Not surprisingly, when China’s population doubled over the course of the eighteenth century, to 400 million people, its cotton industry became the second largest in the world after India’s, growing an estimated 1.5 billion pounds of cotton in 1750, roughly equal to U.S. production as its planters ramped up production in the decade prior to the Civil War. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=661))
- Rulers everywhere demanded cotton cloth as tribute or taxes, and indeed it might be said that cotton was present at the birth of political economy as such. Among the Aztecs, for example, it was the most important medium for tribute payments. In China, beginning in the fifteenth century, households were required to pay some of their taxes in cotton cloth. And in Africa the payment of tribute in cloth was common. Practical as a means to pay taxes, cotton cloth was also used as currency in China, throughout Africa, in Southeast Asia, and in Mesoamerica. Cloth was an ideal medium of exchange because unlike raw cotton it could be easily transported over long distances, was not perishable, and was valuable. Nearly everywhere in the premodern world, a piece of cotton cloth could buy needed things: food, manufactured goods, even protection. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=735))
- Already in the sixth century BCE Indian cotton was traded to Egypt, as merchants brought Indian cotton to Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=768))
- So dominant was Indian cloth on world markets that around 1503 the Italian merchant Lodovico de Varthema observed about the Gujarati port town of Cambay, “This city supplies all Persia, Tartary, Turkey, Syria, Barbary, i.e., Arabia Felix, Africa, Ethiopia, India and a multitude of inhabited islands, with silk and cotton stuff.” The Sanskrit word for cotton goods (karpasi) entered into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, Armenian, Malay, Uigur, Mongolian, and Chinese. Even the names of particular fabrics became global brand names—chintz and jackonet, for example, are corruptions of terms in Indian languages that eventually came to describe a particular style throughout the world. Beginning in the seventeenth century, Indian cottons, in fact, were what historian Beverly Lemire has called the “first global consumer commodity.” ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=778))
- So tight was the association between Islam and cotton that most western European languages borrowed their words for the fiber from the Arabic qutun. French coton, English cotton, Spanish algodón, Portugese algodão, Dutch katoen, and Italian cotone all derive from the Arabic root. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=880))
- the larger cotton industry, already well established on three continents, continued to hum along as it had for centuries. World production still centered on India and China, and intercontinental trade was still dominated by the products of Indian weavers. No significant technological or organizational departures characterized the European industry: Asian producers remained at the cutting edge of textile technology. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=993))
- Europeans lacked the ability to compete in transoceanic markets, not least because the quality of their output was much inferior to that of India. Unlike Indian or Chinese producers, moreover, Europeans depended on the import of raw cotton from distant regions of the world—regions over which they enjoyed little control. And in 1600, most Europeans continued to clothe themselves in linens and woolens. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=999))
- The ultimate result was a radical reorganization of the world’s leading manufacturing industry: an explosion in how and where cotton was grown and manufactured, and a shocking vision of how the crop could yoke the world together. This recasting of cotton did not at first derive from technical advances, nor from organizational advantages, but instead from a far simpler source: the ability and willingness to project capital and power across vast oceans. With increasing frequency, Europeans inserted themselves, often violently, into the global networks of the cotton trade—within Asia as… ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1005))

- European capitalists and rulers altered global networks through multiple means. The muscle of armed trade enabled the creation of a complex, Eurocentric maritime trade web; the forging of a military-fiscal state allowed for the projection of power into the far-flung corners of the world; the invention of financial instruments—from marine insurance to bills of lading—allowed for the transfer of capital and goods over long distances; the development of a legal system gave a modicum of security to global investments; the construction of alliances with distant capitalists and rulers provided access to local weavers and cotton growers; the expropriation of land… ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1014))

- Europeans began establishing formal trade relations on the Indian subcontinent when da Gama obtained permission from local rulers to trade in Calicut in 1498.

- Europeans began to play a role in the transoceanic trade of Indian textiles, pioneered by the Portuguese, who brought large quantities of such cloth to Europe. They also tried to assert their dominance over the important trade between Gujarat and both the Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa—first by violently restricting the access of Gujarati merchants to those traditional… ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1052))
- in: In 1600, merchants established the British East India Company, in 1602 the Dutch Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, and in 1616 the Danish Dansk Ostindiske Kompagni. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch and British were replacing the Portuguese in violently regulating the trade in Gujarati textiles, seizing Gujarati ships, and limiting local merchants’ access to the markets of Arabia and, increasingly, Southeast Asia, which were supplied from factories in southern India, along the Coromandel coast, with Madras at its center. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1055))
- France was the last of the great European powers to launch trade with the East. In 1664, French traders founded the Compagnie des Indes Française and brought the first of what the French called indiennes—colorfully printed cotton cloth—into France. ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1061))
- What all these European trading companies had in common was that they purchased cotton textiles in India, to trade for spices in Southeast Asia, and also to bring to Europe, whence they might be consumed domestically or shipped to Africa to pay for slaves to work the plantations just beginning to take root in the New World. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1066))
- European traders and merchants played an important role in the trade at the Bengali port of Dhaka, which for centuries had been the source of some of the world’s highest-quality cottons. The East India Company as early as 1621 imported an estimated fifty thousand pieces of cotton goods into Britain. Forty years later, this number had increased by a factor of five. Cotton cloths, in fact, became the company’s most important trading good; by 1766 that cloth constituted more than 75 percent of the East India Company’s total exports. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1075))
- In India itself, however, European power was limited. It basically found its end at the outskirts of port cities, or the walls of the forts that these soldier-traders increasingly constructed along the coast. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1082))
- To secure the very large quantities of Indian textiles they exported, European merchants depended on local traders, banias, who guarded their crucial relationships with the inland farmers and weavers who grew, spun, and wove these increasingly valuable goods. Europeans set up warehouses—so-called factories—along the coast of India, in cities such as Madras, Surat, Dhaka, Cossimbazar, and Calicut, where their agents placed orders with banias for cloth and received the wares ready for shipment. ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1084))
- The English merchants subcontracted the task of securing cloth to a number of banias eight to ten months before the trading ships arrived, specifying the qualities, designs, prices, and delivery dates they desired. African and European consumers of cotton textiles demanded very particular goods at particular prices. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1091))
- Banias then advanced cash to various middlemen, who would travel from village to village to advance funds and contract for finished cloth with individual weavers.6 Eventually the cloth traveled the same chain back to the English factory in Dhaka, where merchants graded and prepared it for shipment. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1094))
- In this system of production, the weavers themselves had control over the rhythm and organization of their work, owned their tools, just as they had for centuries, and even retained the right to sell their products to whomever they pleased. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1098))
- Weavers were still poor, yet they could take advantage of competition for their cloth, as did indigenous banias and even Indian rulers, who quickly established taxes and duties on the production and export of cotton cloth. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1102))
- The English complained that the system was frequently disrupted by “Arabians and Moguls who trade in Dacca cloth carrying yearly very considerable quantities of the same overland some so far as the great Turks Dominions,” as well as by the “contest, trouble and Charge” of the weavers and local banias. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1105))
- This “factory” system, with its continuing dependence on local traders and local capital, persisted for roughly two centuries. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1108))
- with bigger, faster, and more reliable boats, and more damaging firepower, “the old pattern of the Indian-Levant trade as the principal artery for world exchange underwent a complete structural change,” one historian concludes, with “the Ottoman Empire…the chief loser.” Gujarati merchants trading with East Africa also began facing European competition. Just as European merchants became increasingly common in India, they also established themselves in the East African markets; as a result, on both sides of the Indian Ocean, Europe’s dominance grew. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1120))
- Beautiful chintzes and muslins attracted the attention of the growing class of Europeans who had the money to purchase them and the desire to flaunt their social status by wearing them. As Indian cottons became ever more fashionable in the eighteenth century, the desire to replace these imports was a powerful incentive to ramping up cotton production in England and eventually to revolutionize it. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1129))
- domination in Asia dovetailed with expansion into the Americas. As Spanish, Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch powers captured huge territories in the Americas, they took away the continent’s movable wealth: gold and silver. It was indeed some of these stolen precious metals that had funded the purchase of cotton fabrics in India in the first place. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1133))
- Eventually, however, European settlers in the Americas could not discover sufficient gold and silver and they invented a new road to wealth: plantations growing tropical and semitropical crops, sugar in particular, but also rice, tobacco, and indigo. Such plantations needed large numbers of workers, and to secure these workers, Europeans deported at first thousands and then millions of Africans to the Americas. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1137))
- European merchants built fortified trading stations along the western coast of Africa—Goree in present-day Senegal, Elmina in present-day Ghana, Ouidah in present-day Benin. They paid African rulers to go on a hunt for labor, exchanging captives for the products of Indian weavers. In the three centuries after 1500, more than 8 million slaves were transported from Africa to the Americas, first mostly by Spanish and Portuguese traders, to be joined in the seventeenth century by the British, French, Dutch, Danish, and others. During the eighteenth century alone, they deported more than 5 million people, mostly from west-central Africa, the Bight of Benin, the Gold Coast, and the Bight of Biafra. ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1141))
- Such trade increased the demand for cotton fabrics, since African rulers and merchants almost always demanded cotton cloth in exchange for slaves. Although it is often imagined that the slave trade was animated by simple exchanges of guns and gewgaws for human export, slaves were more frequently traded for a far more banal commodity: cotton textiles. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1149))
- One study of 1,308 barters of British merchant Richard Miles between 1772 and 1780 for 2,218 Gold Coast slaves found that textiles constituted over half of the value of all traded goods. Portuguese imports to Luanda in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries tell a similar story: Woven goods constituted nearly 60 percent of imports. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1152))
- European trade in cotton textiles tied together Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Europe in a complex commercial web. Never before in the four millennia of the history of cotton had such a globe-spanning system been invented. Never before had the products of Indian weavers paid for slaves in Africa to work on the plantations in the Americas to produce agricultural commodities for European consumers. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1164))
- Europeans had invented a new way of organizing economic activity. This expansion of European trade networks into Asia, Africa, and the Americas did not rest primarily on offering superior goods at good prices, but on the military subjugation of competitors and a coercive European mercantile presence in many regions of the world. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1169))
- In Asia and Africa, Europeans settled coastal enclaves and dominated transoceanic commerce, without at first much involvement in cultivation and manufacturing. In other parts of the world, most prominently the Americas, local populations were expropriated and often displaced or killed. Europeans invented the world anew by embarking upon plantation agriculture on a massive scale. Once Europeans became involved in production, they fastened their economic fortunes to slavery. These three moves—imperial expansion, expropriation, and slavery—became central to the forging of a new global economic order and eventually the emergence of capitalism.

- Heavily armed privateering capitalists became the symbol of this new world of European domination, as their cannon-filled boats and their soldier-traders, armed private militias, and settlers captured land and labor and blew competitors, quite literally, out of the water. Privatized violence was one of their core competencies. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1180))
- Not secure property rights but a wave of expropriation of labor and land characterized this moment, testifying to capitalism’s illiberal origins. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1185))
- War capitalism relied on the capacity of rich and powerful Europeans to divide the world into an “inside” and an “outside.” The “inside” encompassed the laws, institutions, and customs of the mother country, where state-enforced order ruled. The “outside,” by contrast, was characterized by imperial domination, the expropriation of vast territories, decimation of indigenous peoples, theft of their resources, enslavement, and the domination of vast tracts of land by private capitalists with little effective oversight by distant European states. In these imperial dependencies, the rules of the inside did not apply. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1191))
- Power long spread across multiple continents and through numerous networks increasingly became centralized through a single node, dominated by European capitalists and European states. At the core of this change stood cotton, as the multiple and diverse worlds of the production and distribution of this commodity increasingly lost ground to a hierarchical empire organized on a global scale. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1202))
- As Atlantic trade superseded Mediterranean trade and as the New World became an important producer of raw materials, cities with links to the Atlantic also rose in prominence in the manufacturing of cotton textiles. Indeed, as early as the sixteenth century, expanded cotton manufacturing in Europe was contingent on a link to the rapidly expanding markets throughout the Atlantic world—from the cloth markets in Africa to the newly emerging sources of raw cotton in the Americas. In Flemish cities such as Bruges (starting in 1513) and Leiden (starting in 1574), cotton manufacturing burgeoned, as Antwerp began to carry a significant trade in raw cotton and overseas expansion that gave access to huge new markets. French manufacturers, for identical reasons, also embarked upon new cotton spinning and weaving ventures in the late sixteenth century. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1208))
- Cotton manufacturing thrived especially in the northern English county of Lancashire, where both the lack of guild control and the proximity to Liverpool, an important slaving port, became key to producers who supplied the African trade in slaves and plantations in the Americas. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1222))
- As on the continent, cottons were at first manufactured in the countryside. Merchants, many of them Puritans and other dissenters, advanced raw cotton to peasants, who employed family labor seasonally to spin and weave, before returning the cloth to the merchants who sold it. As cotton cloth demand exploded, spinning and weaving became ever more important to smallholding peasants, and some of them eventually gave up their traditional crops and became entirely dependent on the industry. Some of the merchants who organized domestic cotton production turned into substantial businessmen. As they accumulated capital, they expanded production by providing ever more credit to ever more spinners and weavers, encouraging an “extensification” of production—its geographic dispersal throughout ever larger areas of the countryside. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1226))
- Unlike Indian cotton spinners and weavers, the growing class of English cotton workers had no independent access to raw materials or to markets. They were entirely subordinated to the merchants—indeed, they enjoyed less independence and power than their Indian counterparts.19 British putting-out merchants, as a result, had far more power than Indian banias. The British cotton men were part of a rising global power whose navy increasingly dominated the world’s oceans, whose territorial possessions in the Americas and in Asia—India foremost among them—grew rapidly, and whose slavers created a plantation complex that rested in various ways on the manufacturing capacity of spinners and weavers thousands of miles away in the remote uplands of Lancashire and the plains of Bengal. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1236))
- By the 1730s, the Dhaka factory, for example, hosted a contingent of military personnel and arms to protect the company’s interests. Most dramatically, by 1765 the British East India Company—a group of merchants—ruled Bengal, and in the decades thereafter expanded its control over other South Asian territories. Such territorial dreams were furthered by British merchants’ increasing investment in the raw cotton trade between India and China by the late eighteenth century, which made them hope for the integration of western Indian cotton tracts into East India Company territories as well. This assertion of private political power by a state-chartered company over distant territories was a revolutionary reconceptualization of economic might. States shared sovereignty over territory and people with private entrepreneurs. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1305))
- To further their goal, the company now also employed its coercive powers toward the weavers directly. The company hired large numbers of Indians to supervise and implement new rules and regulations, in effect bureaucratizing the cloth market. Extensive new regulations attached weavers legally to the company, making them unable to sell their cloth on the open market. Company agents now inspected cloth on the loom, and endeavored to ensure that the cloth was, as promised, sold to the company. A new system of taxation penalized those weavers who produced for others. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1344))
- Such agitation led to protectionist measures. In 1685, England imposed a 10 percent duty on “all calicoes and other Indian linen and all wrought silks which are manufactures of India.” In 1690, the tariff was doubled. In 1701, Parliament outlawed the import of printed cottons, leading to the importation of plain calicoes for further processing in England, giving a huge boost to British calico printing. A 1721 law went so far as to ban people from wearing printed calicoes if the white calicoes themselves originated from India, a measure that gave an impetus to calico fabrication in Britain. Selling Indian cottons was eventually criminalized altogether: ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1414))
- In 1774, Parliament decreed that cotton cloth for sale in England had to be made exclusively of cotton spun and woven in England. Only goods destined for reexport were permitted from the East Indies. The Indian cotton goods not subject to these bans, such as plain chintz and muslins, were subject to heavy tariffs. In the end, all of these protectionist measures did not help the domestic woolen and linen industry, but did spur domestic cotton manufacture. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1421))
- Explicitly excluded from the long list of prohibited Indian textiles, however, were those destined for Guinée, that is, textiles used in the slave trade. Slaves, after all, could only be gotten by exchanging them for the cottons from India. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1431))
- Europe’s movement toward manufacturing cotton textiles was based, in fact, on what might be considered one of history’s most dramatic instances of industrial espionage. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1454))
- By 1770, it had become clear that markets for cotton textiles in Europe, but even more so in Africa, the Americas, and, of course, Asia, were huge—and the opportunities for profit to anyone able to produce for these markets on a competitive basis virtually limitless. ([Location 1486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1486))
- As historian Joseph E. Inikori has shown, in 1760, Britain exported about one-third of its cotton cloth production. By the end of the eighteenth century the share going abroad had expanded to about two-thirds. Africa and the Americas were the most important markets. By mid-century, 94 percent of all cotton cloth exports from Britain went there. The sheer scale of this market meant that those able to compete there could reap fortunes. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1500))
- Imperial expansion, slavery, and land expropriations—war capitalism—laid the foundations for the still small and technologically backward domestic cotton industry in Europe. It provided dynamic markets and access to technology and to essential raw materials. It also became a significant engine of capital formation. Mercantile cities such as Liverpool, which derived their wealth largely from slavery, became important sources of capital for the emerging cotton industry, and cotton merchants in Liverpool provided ever more credit to manufacturers to enable them to work up the cotton. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1517))
- Moreover, as these merchants gained wealth in long-distance trade, they could demand political protections from a government increasingly dependent on extracting revenue from them. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1523))
- Last but not least, war capitalism also nourished the emerging secondary sectors of the economy such as insurance, finance, and shipping, sectors that would become exceedingly important to the emergence of the British cotton industry, but also public institutions such as government credit, money itself, and national defense.

- Long before the advent of new cotton-producing technologies, they had in fact already rearranged the global cotton industry and global cotton networks. These networks were dominated by the joint venture of private capital and increasingly robust states. Together their commitment to armed trade, industrial espionage, prohibitions, restrictive trade regulations, domination of territories, capturing of labor, removal of indigenous inhabitants, and the state-sponsored creation of territories that were then left to the far-reaching domination of capitalists had created a new economic order. ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1533))
- starting in the sixteenth century, armed European capitalists and capital-rich European states reorganized the world’s cotton industry. It was this early embrace of war capitalism that was the precondition for the Industrial Revolution that eventually created an enormous further push toward global economic integration and continues to shape and reshape our world today.

- Two centuries ago that river inspired a British merchant to launch one of the most important experiments in human history. In 1784, on the bank of the stream, Samuel Greg gathered together in a small factory a few newfangled spinning machines, so-called water frames, a collection of orphaned children, putting-out workers from surrounding villages, and a supply of Caribbean cotton. Eschewing the power supply that spinners had been using for hundreds of years—human—Greg put his yarn-spinning machines into motion using the weight of falling water.

- Like Silicon Valley’s role as the incubator of the late-twentieth-century computer revolution, the idyllic rolling hills around Manchester emerged in the late eighteenth century as the hotbed of that era’s cutting-edge industry—cotton textiles. In an area forming an arc of about thirty-five miles around Manchester, the countryside filled with mills, country towns turned into cities, and tens of thousands of people moved from farms into factories.

- From this local spark, England came to dominate a many-pronged world economy, making one of humanity’s most important industries its own. From this local spark, industrial capitalism would emerge and eventually spread its wings across the globe. From this local spark, the world as most of us know it emerged.

- modern labor cost accounting had emerged from the world of the slave plantation and only later migrated into modern industry. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1658))
- While certainly still revolutionary, industrial capitalism was the offspring of war capitalism, the previous centuries’ great innovation. ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1668))
- In the 1780s, Greg invested at first a fairly small amount of capital into his Quarry Bank Mill: £3,000, the equivalent of about half a million U.S. dollars today. Then he recruited ninety children between the ages of ten and twelve from nearby poorhouses, attaching them for seven years to his factory as “parish apprentices.” By 1800 he supplemented these children with 110 adult workers who received wages. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1679))
- Contemporary observers as well as modern historians have found many reasons that explain Greg’s venture, and with it why the much broader Industrial Revolution, “broke out” in this place, in northern England, and at this time, in the 1780s. The genius of British inventors, the size of the British market and its unusually deep integration, the geography of Britain with its easy access to waterborne transport, the importance of religious dissenters for thinking outside the box, and the creation of a state favorable to entrepreneurial initiative have all been cited.6 While none of these arguments are unimportant, they omit a core part of the story of the Industrial Revolution: its dependence on the globe-spanning system of war capitalism. ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1686))
- for the first time ever, a new character, the manufacturer, strode onto the scene, an individual who used capital not to enslave labor or conquer territory, though that remained essential, but to organize workers into great orchestras of machine-based production. Manufacturers’ efforts to reorganize production rested on new ways of mobilizing land, labor, and resources—and called, among other things, for a new connection between capitalists and the state. It was this nexus of social and political power that together animated industrial capitalism, the transformational invention of the Industrial Revolution. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1693))
- industrial capitalism was creating an ever-changing world, and cotton, the world’s most important industry, was the mainspring of this unprecedented acceleration of human productivity. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1707))
- British capitalists, however, in contrast to their counterparts elsewhere, controlled many global cotton networks. They had access to uniquely dynamic markets, they dominated the transoceanic trade in cottons, and they had firsthand knowledge of the fabulous potential wealth that could come from selling cloth. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1721))
- In the course of the eighteenth century, as we have seen, British producers had largely (though not entirely) solved the quality problem by appropriating Indian technology. Expanding output, and lowering costs, proved more difficult: The putting-out networks that British merchants had built in the countryside proved largely resistant to higher production. Work was performed irregularly, additional workers were difficult to mobilize on short notice, and transportation costs rose with the volume of work. And it was difficult to enforce homogeneous quality in products spun and woven on remote farms. With the existing technology and social organization of production, British outworkers could hardly compete with cotton workers in other parts of the world. Indeed, they succeeded mostly only in the protected domestic and colonial markets. ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1724))
- 1770 Lancashire wages were perhaps as much as six times those in India. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1732))
- What British cotton capitalists needed was a dynamic combination of new technologies to lower costs, the further growth of elastic markets that already had begun to expand on the tails of British expansion, and a supportive state with the ability not just to protect global empire but to transform society in Britain itself. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1738))
- Since labor costs were the primary obstacle to grasping the new tantalizing opportunities, British merchants, inventors, and budding manufacturers—practical men all—focused on methods to increase the productivity of their high-cost labor. In the process, they effected the most momentous technological change in the history of cotton. Their first noteworthy innovation came in 1733 with John Kay’s invention of the flying shuttle. This small wooden tool in the shape of the hull of a ship allowed weavers to attach the weft thread and then propel it to “fly” from one side of the loom to the other through the warp threads. The shuttle doubled the productivity of weavers. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1742))
- by the 1760s productivity increases became possible with James Hargreaves’s invention of the spinning jenny. The jenny consisted of a hand-operated wheel that would rotate a number of spindles within a frame, while the spinner would use her other hand to move a bar back and forth to extend the thread and then to wind it on the spindles themselves. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1754))
- As early as 1769, however, spinning was already seeing further improvements thanks to Richard Arkwright’s water frame, a machine that anticipated Greg’s mill by relying on falling water. Consisting of four rollers that drew out the cotton strands before a spindle twisted them into thread, it allowed for continuous spinning, and unlike the jenny, which had at first been mostly employed in people’s homes, the water frame required larger amounts of energy, thus concentrating production in factories. ([Location 1760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1760))
- A decade later, in 1779, Samuel Crompton’s mule was the capstone of these inventions, combining elements of the jenny with those of the water frame (hence its name). The mule was a long machine with two parallel carriages: Bobbins of roving (lightly twisted cotton fibers) lined one side, and spindles ready to accept spun yarn lined the other. The exterior carriage, mounted on wheels, was pulled out about five feet, stretching multiple lengths of roving simultaneously. ([Location 1766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1766))
- The stretched roving was then twisted into yarn and wound onto the spindles as the carriage was pushed back in. ([Location 1771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1771))
- In eighteenth-century India, spinners required 50,000 hours to spin a hundred pounds of raw cotton; their cohorts in 1790 Britain, using a hundred-spindle mule, could spin the same amount in just 1,000 hours. By 1795 they needed just 300 hours with the water frame, or, with Roberts’s automated mule after 1825, only 135 hours. In just three decades, productivity had increased 370 times. Labor costs in England were now much lower than in India. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1783))
- These new machines, the “macro inventions” celebrated by historians Joel Mokyr, Patrick O’Brien, and many others, not only accelerated human productivity, but also altered the nature of the production process itself: They began to regulate the pace of human labor.19 Dependent on central energy sources and requiring large spaces, production moved out of the home and into factories. Along with the machines, workers assembled in unprecedented numbers in central locations. While putting-out merchants had traversed the countryside searching for laborers, now workers sought out manufacturers in search of employment. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1824))
- Although mills could vary tremendously in size, they shared one attribute: a nearby source of running water. To harness its energy, either a dam was constructed or an inlet was cut from a steep section of river and diverted through a waterwheel. The waterwheel drove shafts that ran through the length of the mill, upon which large leather belts could be engaged or disengaged in order to run the various machines. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1831))
- Unlike its predecessors, the mill’s primary function was not to simply aggregate and control labor, but to house a complex array of machinery. And by the 1780s, some mills were taking on gargantuan proportions; at two hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, and four to six stories in height, they dominated the surrounding countryside. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1835))
- This was, as we will see later, another important institutional innovation of industrial capitalism. Outside the slave plantations of the Americas capitalists for the first time organized, supervised, and dominated the production process. ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1852))
- Such domination of labor by capital, embrace of technological revolution, and social innovation did not happen elsewhere, including in the heart of the world’s cotton industry, China and India. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1855))
- Moreover, in India and China, peasants were more secure on the land than their British counterparts, making it more difficult for eager manufacturers to mobilize large numbers of workers. Because of the different organization of households, especially limitations on women’s outside activities, female-dominated spinning had extremely low opportunity costs in India and China, making the embrace of new technologies less likely. Women’s labor, in the calculation of peasant households, was inexpensive. In India, additionally, the chain between the weaver and the final consumer was a long one, with many intermediaries. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1867))
- The growth of cotton manufacturing soon made it the center of the British economy. In 1770, cotton manufacturing had made up just 2.6 percent of the value added in the economy as a whole. By 1801 it accounted for 17 percent, and by 1831, 22.4 percent. This compared to the iron industry’s share of 6.7 percent, coal’s 7 percent, and woolens’ 14.1 percent. In Britain, as early as 1795, 340,000 people worked in the spinning industry. By 1830, one in six workers in Britain labored in cottons. At the same time, the industry itself became centered on a small part of the British Isles: Lancashire. Seventy percent of all British cotton workers would eventually labor there, while 80.3 percent of all owners of cotton factories originated in that same county. ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1931))
- other industries would be made possible by the rise of cotton: a railroad network, the iron industry, and later in the nineteenth century a new set of industries that would amount to a second industrial revolution. But cotton was the vanguard. ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1937))
- Over the course of the eighteenth century cotton exports from Britain increased two hundred times—yet 94 percent of that increase took place in the two decades after 1780, when exports exploded by a factor greater than sixteen from their 1780 value of £355,060 to £5,854,057 in 1800. By the last years of the eighteenth century, 61.3 percent of all cotton cloth produced on the British Isles was exported. After 1815, thanks to these exports, England had indeed pretty much “eliminated all rivals from the non-European world” in the global trade of cotton yarn and cloth. ([Location 1952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1952))
- As a result, Indian weavers, who had dominated global cotton textile markets for centuries, went into free fall. In 1800, commercial resident John Taylor wrote a detailed history of the clothing industry of the Bengali city of Dhaka and reported that the value of cloth exports there had fallen by 50 percent between 1747 and 1797. ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1971))
- British cottons captured the multifaceted export markets formerly controlled by Indian spinners and weavers, while manufacturers focused at first on selling to parts of the world subject to war capitalism. During the last decades of the eighteenth century, the heyday of the Industrial Revolution, more than two-thirds of British cotton exports went to such places. Exports flowed, in effect, within the same channels of the Atlantic economy that Britain had spent two hundred years and untold treasure building. ([Location 1982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1982))
- cotton exports expanded on the strength of British trade networks and the institutions in which they were embedded—from a strong navy creating and protecting market access to bills of lading allowing for the transfer of capital over large distances. This state was capable of forging and protecting global markets, policing its borders, regulating industry, creating and then enforcing private property rights in land, enforcing contracts over large geographical distances, forging fiscal tools to tax populations, and building a social, economic, and legal environment that made the mobilization of labor through wage payments possible. ([Location 1994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=1994))
- Indeed, in the end, it was not so much the new machines that revolutionized the world, impressive and important as they were. The truly heroic invention was the economic, social, and political institutions in which these machines were embedded. These institutions came to further define industrial capitalism and increasingly set it apart from its parent, war capitalism. ([Location 2001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2001))
- A rising group of manufacturers pressed for a recognition of their interests, while statesmen and bureaucrats came to understand that their own exalted position in the world rested on Great Britain’s rapidly expanding manufacturing capacity. Manufacturers fought competing interests—the East India Company, for example—and competing elites, such as aristocratic landowners. And as merchants and manufacturers accumulated significant resources on which the state came to depend, these capitalists could translate their growing importance to the national economy into political influence.39 Cotton mill owners became increasingly active politically, culminating in the 1832 Reform Act that extended them the suffrage, allowing many textile entrepreneurs to move into the House of Commons, where they strenuously lobbied for the (global) interests of their industry, from the Corn Laws to British colonial expansion. ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2006))
- Built by newly empowered manufacturers and a state with vastly increased capacity, industrial capitalism found a very different answer to the question of how to mobilize labor, capital, and markets compared to its parent, war capitalism. Labor, unlike in the Americas, could be mobilized because changes in the countryside, including legal changes, had already produced a large group of landless proletarians who were forced to sell their labor power to survive, and did so without being physically coerced. Moreover, unlike for the plantation economy of the Americas, the territorial needs of cotton manufacturing were limited and focused mostly on accessing waterpower. As markets in land had emerged centuries before, and property rights in land were relatively secure and protected by the state, the land grab so typical of war capitalism did not and could not emerge in Britain itself. At the same time, an interventionist state was able to promote land uses deemed helpful to general economic development, for instance by allowing expropriations for the building of turnpikes and canals. Moreover, a highly centralized and bureaucratic state regulated and taxed domestic industry. ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2023))
- most decisive for this early moment in the emergence of industrial capitalism, the mechanisms of war capitalism could be externalized thanks to the state’s imperial expansion, in effect reducing capitalists’ need to recast the domestic social structure and their dependence on domestic resources, ranging from labor to food to raw materials. Some of the problems in the mobilization of labor, raw materials, territories, and markets had indeed been solved by war capitalism in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. And it was again a strong state (a state fortified by the institutional and financial accumulations of war capitalism) that was the root cause of the ability to externalize some of the labor, land, and resource mobilization. This state could in fact enforce different kinds of institutions in different parts of the world, with slavery and wage labor coexisting, for example. ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2034))
- The modern state at its core was sometimes less “visible” than autocratic monarchical rule, and thus seemed “weaker” as its power was increasingly embedded in impersonal rules, laws, and bureaucratic mechanisms. Paradoxically, industrial capitalism made state power less visible as it amplified it. No longer did the personal authority of the king, the lord, or the master, or age-old custom, regulate the market; instead the market was made by explicit rules relentlessly enforced by contracts, laws, and regulations. ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2042))
- Tellingly, even though Edward Baines argued in 1835 that “this [cotton] trade was not the nursling of government protection,” he proceeded to list in chronological order all “interferences of the legislature” that related to the cotton industry, from prohibitions to tariffs—a list that would fill seven pages, a striking reminder of the state’s importance to ensuring the “free” market of cotton.43 In Great Britain and eventually in a few other states, this dependence of capitalists on the state attached them firmly to one another and resulted in a kind of territorialization and “nationalization” of manufacturing capital. Ironically, that link between capitalists and the state would eventually also empower workers, who could deploy the state’s dependence on the consent of the governed to mobilize collectively for higher wages and better working conditions.

- It was also because of the awe-inspiring capacity of modern states (what Hegel would call the “spirit of history”) that war capitalism’s way of mobilizing land, labor, and markets would be largely irrelevant within Europe itself. This is in many ways surprising. After all, large-scale and capital-intensive enterprises, the mobilization of vast numbers of workers, and the tight managerial supervision of those workers had all been pioneered to great profit on the plantations of the Americas and seemed to show the way toward the reorganization of production. Yet in Britain itself, war capitalism provided only the foundation, not the nature, of capitalism. To dominate production, workers were neither enslaved nor populations murdered, for capitalists were not fulfilling frontier fantasies beyond the reach of the state. This was revolutionary, but in our world, in which the institutional foundations of industrial capitalism have become commonplace, it is hard to appreciate just how revolutionary it was.

- Cotton goods valued at £150 million were exported between 1773 and 1815, estimated Baines, filling the coffers of manufacturers, merchants—and the state. It was the volume and balance of trade that provided the state the revenues it needed to invest, for example, in expanded naval power in the first place. State revenues indeed increased by a factor of sixteen between the late seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries, as Britain engaged in these years in a total of fifty-six years of warfare. And fully one-third of tax revenues in 1800 came from customs. ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2070))
- The first, lurching stages of this great acceleration, as seen at Quarry Bank Mill, might still have appeared modest. To modern eyes, the new technologies seem quaint, the factories small, and the impact of the cotton industry limited to a few regions in just one small part of the world, while much of the globe, even much of Great Britain, continued as before.

- once the social and institutional scaffolding of industrial capitalism had been invented in a decades-long conflict between capitalists, aristocrats, the state, workers, and peasants, it could spread to other industries and other parts of the world. The territory for further transformations was huge. ([Location 2085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2085))
- The Industrial Revolution, powered by cotton, was, as historian Eric Hobsbawm has put it, “the most important event in world history.” It created a world unlike any that had come before. “This land of long chimneys,” as cotton manufacturer Thomas Ashton called it in 1837, was not just different from the centuries-old world of the British countryside, it was also a vast leap from the world of war capitalism that merchants, planters, and state officials had forged over the previous two hundred years.

- Alexis de Tocqueville made that same pilgrimage in 1835 and saw a “sort of black smoke [that] covers the city. The sun seen through it is a disk without rays. Under this half daylight 300,000 human beings are ceaselessly at work. A thousand noises disturb this damp, dark labyrinth, but they are not at all the ordinary sounds one hears in great cities.” However, Tocqueville added, it was “from this foul drain [that] the greatest stream of human industry flows out to fertilise the whole world. From this filthy sewer pure gold flows. Here humanity attains its most complete development and its most brutish; here civilisation works its miracles, and civilised man is turned back almost into a savage.” ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2096))
- Within Britain, and within two decades, cotton’s evolution was vast. It began as one of the many spoils of imperial expansion, and became the driving commodity behind the Industrial Revolution. From tufted white bolls emerged a new global system: industrial capitalism. There was of course inventiveness and innovation in other industries, but cotton was the only one with a global scope, a strong connection to coercive labor, and a unique level of the state’s imperial attention to capture the necessary markets across the world. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2104))
- Although industrial capitalism would eventually dominate the world, in the immediate aftermath of its birth it helped to expand and sharpen war capitalism elsewhere. That was because England’s lopsided lead in the exploitation of industrial capitalism rested in the ability of its merchants to secure ever more inexpensive and predictable supplies of cotton for its factories.47 And while British cotton manufacturers quite suddenly demanded huge new quantities of cotton, the institutional structures of industrial capitalism were still too immature and provincial to generate the labor and territory needed to produce all this cotton. For a terrible ninety years, from about 1770 to 1860, as we will see, industrial capitalism reinvigorated rather than replaced war capitalism.

- At first glance, Danson seemed correct. The year his essay was published, a full 68 percent of all cotton arriving in the United Kingdom came from the United States, and slaves grew most of it. Yet the reality that seemed so self-evident to Danson and others was only a recent invention. Indeed, in the five thousand years of the history of the world’s cotton industry, slavery had never played an important role. And it was not just slavery that was new. The emerging cotton complex centered in Europe was also unique because it did not draw on the production of nearby peasants for its raw materials. As late as 1791, most of the cotton grown for manufacturing purposes around the world was produced by small farmers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and consumed locally.

- In the crucible of the late-eighteenth-century cotton revolution, cotton built its last, but most decisive, link to the newly global, dynamic, and violent form of capitalism, whose signal feature was the coercive expropriation of land and labor. Necessitated by the yawning gap between the imperatives of mechanized manufacturing and the capacities of premodern agriculture, at its core was slavery.4 Rapidly expanding factories consumed cotton so fast that only the exigencies of war capitalism could secure the necessary reallocation of land and labor. As a result, indigenous people and land-grabbing settlers, slaves and planters, local artisans and factory owners woke to a new century clouded by a constant, if one-sided, state of war. ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2153))
- British cotton manufacturing—and later, manufacturing across Europe—seemed a poor bet, for it was the first major industry in human history that lacked locally procured raw materials. ([Location 2171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2171))
- Cotton spinning and weaving was different, with British manufacturers entirely dependent upon imports. To flourish, they required not just Asian technologies and African markets, but also raw material from yet another continent. Managing to acquire these materials meant building the first globally integrated manufacturing industry. ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2176))
- in 1780, even as mechanical innovations occurred at a remarkable pace, a key piece of this global integration—the actual supply of cotton—remained undiscovered. The solution that emerged—slaves in the southern United States growing cotton on land expropriated from Native Americans—was far from obvious from the perspective of British cotton manufacturers and merchants. After all, in 1780 no cotton whatsoever arrived from North America. ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2179))
- A severe labor shortage and the tenacity of feudal relations in the Ottoman countryside limited the supply from Anatolia and Macedonia. The labor shortage was such that beginning in the 1770s landowners in western Anatolia brought in thousands of Greek laborers to grow cotton—an expansion that still did not provide the scale necessary for the supply of European industry. The largely precapitalist dependencies that structured the world of rural cultivators, the efforts of peasants to secure their subsistence, the lack of transportation infrastructure, and the continued political independence of the Ottoman state contributed to Europeans’ inability to press for the monocultural production of cotton. ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2208))
- Local elites, moreover, remained a powerful counterweight against the increasingly influential presence of Western merchants in port cities such as Izmir and Thessaloniki, hampering the ability of Western capitalists to reform the social structure in the countryside to produce more cotton for world markets. Western merchants were also competing for what cotton there was with domestic spinners, a sizable and relatively prosperous artisan class. As a result, Ottoman cotton soon became marginal to European markets: while between 1786 and 1790 the Ottoman Empire supplied 20 percent of cotton imports to Great Britain, twenty years later it supplied only 1.28 percent and another ten years later a minuscule 0.29 percent. Unable or unwilling to revolutionize their countryside and trade networks, Ottoman cotton farmers and merchants exited the emerging European industrial system.

- Manufacturers also cast an acquisitive eye toward India’s bountiful cotton harvests. Given that the East India Company enjoyed significant power on the subcontinent and that India was the ancient home of the world’s cotton industry, many expected it to become a major source of fiber. The company, however, reacted warily to Manchester’s appeals. The export of raw cotton, they argued, would undermine manufacturing in India and therefore its own profitable export business of cotton cloth. ([Location 2226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2226))
- Whatever cotton there was available for export the East India Company shipped to China to finance its purchases of tea, replacing the need to export bullion there. The resistance of the East India Company compounded other difficulties: infrastructure that made moving cotton to the coast often prohibitively expensive, the quality of Indian cotton, especially its short fiber, and a lack of labor in the vast interior of the South Asian subcontinent. In short, Indian cotton exports to Britain proved insufficient to satisfy the growing demand. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2236))
- In the boom years of the 1770s through the 1790s, cotton was especially attractive to two up-and-coming groups of planters. The first consisted of small growers who lacked the capital necessary to start a sugar plantation and wanted a crop that would let them work more marginal lands, with fewer slaves and less investment, and still make fabulous profits. On Saint-Croix, for example, the average cotton plantation drew on the labor of less than a fifth as many slaves as the average sugar plantation. The second group consisted of planters in newly settled territories who planted cotton as a first crop for a few seasons to break the soil and would then use the cotton profits to move into sugar. ([Location 2251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2251))
- on islands with more uncultivated land and fewer sugar plantations, production boomed. On Barbados between 1768 and 1789, cotton exports increased by a factor of eleven, from 240,000 pounds to 2.6 million pounds. First, an ant invasion had decimated Barbados’s traditional crop, sugar. Then in 1780 a massive hurricane destroyed much of the island’s sugar infrastructure, which could not easily be rebuilt because of limited access to raw materials from revolution-torn North America. Transformed essentially into a huge cotton plantation, Barbados became the most productive cotton island within the British Empire. Similarly, Tobago planters had exported no cotton in 1770 but shipped a full 1.5 million pounds in 1780. And planters in the Bahamas, who had grown virtually no cotton before the 1770s, by 1787 sold nearly half a million pounds to British merchants. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2270))
- At the height of the cotton boom, in the 1780s, as cotton prices in France increased by 113 percent over 1770 levels, nearly thirty thousand slaves were shipped to Saint-Domingue annually. That elasticity of the labor supply, a hallmark of war capitalism, was unmatched by any other region of the world. Indeed, as mechanized spinning spread on the European continent, ever more Africans were put in shackles, forced into the holds of ships, sold on the auction block in Port-au-Prince, transported to remote farms, and then forced to clear the land and hoe, sow, prune, and harvest the white gold.18 ([Location 2292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2292))
- Slavery, in other words, was as essential to the new empire of cotton as proper climate and good soil. It was slavery that allowed these planters to respond rapidly to rising prices and expanding markets. Slavery allowed not only for the mobilization of very large numbers of workers on very short notice, but also for a regime of violent supervision and virtually ceaseless exploitation that matched the needs of a crop that was, in the cold language of economists, “effort intensive.” ([Location 2300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2300))
- Encouraged by their home governments, rising prices, the availability of labor, and, within bounds, land, Caribbean planters became the cutting edge of the cotton revolution. From that moment on, ever newer cotton frontiers replaced one another, motivated by the unrelenting search for land and labor, as well as soils that had yet to escape the ecological exhaustion that so often came with cotton growing. The world’s cotton industry relied upon “ceaseless spatial expansion.” ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2306))
- Caribbean planters, unlike Ottoman and Indian farmers, faced few constraints on land and labor. With the native population decimated and slaves arriving on an almost daily basis from West Africa, Caribbean planters’ ability to respond rapidly to newly emerging markets set them decisively apart from all other cotton growers. While powerful Ottoman and Indian landlords also resorted to coercion to force peasants to work on their cotton estates, plantation slavery, as such, never took root.21 Moreover, the infusion of capital that enabled the rapid reallocation of resources in the Caribbean was hampered elsewhere by the lack of private ownership of land and the continued political strength of the Ottoman and Indian rulers. Fresh land and new labor, capitalized by virtually unrestrained European merchants, bankers, and planters, precipitated an explosion of cotton growing. ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2313))
- the true importance of the Caribbean planters was not the cotton that was shipped, though that remained essential, but the institutional innovation that the Caribbean experiment produced: the re-creation of the countryside through bodily coercion, something only possible under war capitalism. Cotton grown by slaves motivated and financed the unprecedented incorporation of newly depopulated territories into the world economy. Slavery and land expropriation on a continental scale created the expansive, and elastic, global cotton supply network necessary for the Industrial Revolution, and with it the mechanisms through which the needs and rhythms of industrial life in Europe could be transferred to the global countryside. ([Location 2335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2335))
- a new kind of slavery (what historians have called “second slavery”) emerged that was tightly linked to the intensity and profits of industrial capitalism—a dynamic that soon drew the African continent into its grasp as well, where West African economies increasingly found their focus in supplying sharply rising numbers of workers to the Americas. Approximately half of all slaves (46 percent, to be precise) sold to the Americas between 1492 and 1888 arrived there in the years after 1780. Slavery’s future was now firmly attached to the industrial capitalism that it had enabled. ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2340))
- As in the West Indies, cotton in Brazil would never challenge sugar and later coffee, but its share of total exports in Brazil grew to a respectable 11 percent in 1800, and 20 percent in the years between 1821 and 1830.25 ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2361))
- For a few years in the late 1700s, the period when neither West Indian nor Ottoman cotton production had expanded sufficiently and before North American cotton swamped markets, Brazil became a very important supplier to the booming British cotton textile industry. Not only did Brazilian farmers produce significant amounts of cotton, but they were also able to grow a particularly long-staple variety that was better suited to emerging factory technology. ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2368))
- By the 1780s, slaves in the West Indies and South America produced the vast majority of cotton sold on world markets, and this explosive combination of slavery and conquest fueled the Industrial Revolution all the way to 1861. John Tarleton, a successful slave trader and Liverpool cotton merchant, understood that the slave trade, the export of commodities from plantation economies, and the well-being of the British shipping industry were all “mutually blended & connected together.” And the combination was stupendously profitable: Cotton and slaves made many merchants rich, with Tarleton calculating, for example, that his “fortune” had tripled between 1770 and 1800.27 ([Location 2373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2373))
- In 1860, with the appetite for cotton even greater, more than 1 million workers (or half of all British agricultural workers) would have had to work these fields, which would have taken up 6.3 million acres or 37 percent of all arable land in Great Britain. Alternatively, if we assume that the woolen industry, instead of the cotton industry, had been at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution even more land would have been needed to raise the required number of sheep: 9 million acres in 1815, and 23 million acres in 1830—or more than Britain’s entire arable land area. Under both the hypothetical domestic cotton and the wool scenario, land and labor constraints would have made all but impossible the sudden expansion of cloth production. Perhaps even more decisively, such a scenario would have created unimaginable upheaval in the British and European countryside, whose social structure, like that of the Ottoman Empire and India, was not suited for such a massive and quick reallocation of land and labor. ([Location 2385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2385))
- As already mentioned, the West Indian islands themselves had a rather low supply of suitable cotton lands, limiting cotton production and putting it at a long-term disadvantage with sugar. Sugar plantations there as well as in land-rich Brazil also competed with cotton plantations for labor. ([Location 2399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2399))
- In Brazil, the lack of a massive redeployment of slaves from sugar into cotton production acted as a brake on the expansion of cotton production. ([Location 2405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2405))

- The combination of rapidly rising demand for cotton and political upheaval in the Caribbean led to worrisome price spikes for manufacturers dependent on capturing new markets for cotton textiles by competing with Indian production. Throughout 1791 and 1792 John Tarleton reported to his brother that “Cotton is rising daily.” By 1795 he found “Cotton up amazingly.” In 1790, prices for West Indian cotton peaked at 21 pence per pound, in 1791 at 30 pence, and prices stayed consistently high throughout the 1790s.

- to Europeans in the 1780s, cotton was the product of the West Indies, of Brazil, of the Ottoman Empire, and of India—but not of North America.

- long-staple Sea Island cotton, named after the location of their plantations on islands just off the coast of Georgia, with seeds they had brought from the Bahamas. Unlike the local cottons, this cotton had a long, silky fiber, which made it exceedingly well suited for finer yarns and cloths, much in demand by Manchester manufacturers. ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2505))
- the planting of Sea Island cotton spread up and down the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. Exports from South Carolina, for example, ballooned from less than 10,000 pounds in 1790 to 6.4 million pounds in 1800.7 ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2511))
- Production received a decisive boost in 1791 when rebellion eliminated cotton rival Saint-Domingue, Europe’s most important source of cotton, sending prices upward and scattering the entire class of French cotton planters: Some went to Cuba and other islands; many came to the United States. ([Location 2515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2515))
- While Sea Island cotton production expanded rapidly, it soon reached its limit, as the variety failed at any substantial distance from the coast. Farther inland, a different strain of cotton thrived, so-called upland cotton, shorter in staple length, with the fiber tightly attached to its seed. It was difficult to remove the seeds with the help of existing gins, but with demand increasing and prices high, planters had their slaves work it up in a slow and tedious process by roller gins modeled after Indian churkas. ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2524))
- Planters yearned for a device that would more quickly separate seed from fiber. In 1793, Eli Whitney, only a few months after arriving in Savannah from his college days at Yale, built the first working model of a new kind of cotton gin that was able to rapidly remove the seeds of upland cotton. Overnight, his machine increased ginning productivity by a factor of fifty. News of the innovation spread quickly; farmers everywhere built copies of the gin. Like the jenny and the water frame, Eli’s gin overcame yet another bottleneck in the production of cotton textiles. As a result, in what can only be described as a “cotton rush,” land on which cotton grew allegedly trebled in price after the invention of the gin, and “the annual income of those who plant it is double to what it was before the introduction of cotton.” ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2529))

- To enable such expanded production, planters brought with them thousands of slaves. In the 1790s, the slave population of the state of Georgia nearly doubled, to sixty thousand. In South Carolina, the number of slaves in the upcountry cotton growing districts grew from twenty-one thousand in 1790 to seventy thousand twenty years later, including fifteen thousand slaves newly brought from Africa. As cotton plantations spread, the proportion of slaves in four typical South Carolina upcountry counties increased from 18.4 percent in 1790 to 39.5 percent in 1820 and to 61.1 percent in 1860. ([Location 2542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2542))
- The only substantial problem was the land, as the same patch could not be used for more than a few years without either planting legumes on it or applying expensive guano to it. ([Location 2549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2549))
- After 1815, cotton planters moved westward into the rich lands of upland South Carolina and Georgia. Their migration to Alabama and Louisiana, and eventually to Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas, was choreographed to the movement of cotton prices. While the price of cotton gradually declined over the first half of the nineteenth century, sharp price upswings—such as in the first half of the 1810s, between 1832 and 1837, and again after the mid-1840s—produced expansionist bursts. ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2554))
- The entry of the United States into the empire of cotton was so forceful that cotton cultivation in the American South quickly began to reshape the global cotton market. In 1790, three years before Whitney’s invention, the United States had produced 1.5 million pounds of cotton; in 1800 that number grew to 36.5 million pounds, and in 1820 to 167.5 million pounds. Exports to Great Britain increased by a factor of ninety-three between 1791 and 1800, only to multiply another seven times by 1820. By 1802 the United States was already the single most important supplier of cotton to the British market, and by 1857 it would produce about as much cotton as China.

- Native Americans still controlled substantial territories only a few hundred miles inland from the coastal provinces, yet they were unable to stop the white settlers’ steady encroachment. The settlers eventually won a bloody and centuries-long war, succeeding in turning the land of Native Americans into land that was legally “empty.” This was a land whose social structures had been catastrophically weakened or eliminated, a land without most of its people and thus without the entanglements of history. In terms of unencumbered land, the South had no rival in the cotton-growing world. ([Location 2589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2589))
- In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the territory of the United States, in 1819 the United States acquired Florida from Spain, and in 1845 it annexed Texas. All of these acquisitions contained lands superbly suited to cotton agriculture. Indeed, by 1850, 67 percent of U.S. cotton grew on land that had not been part of the United States half a century earlier. The fledging U.S. government had inaugurated the military-cotton complex.

- these frontier planters at the rough edges of the empire of cotton had well-dressed and well-spoken company. British banker Thomas Baring, one of the world’s greatest cotton merchants, for example, was instrumental in the expansion of the empire of cotton when he financed the purchase of the Louisiana lands, negotiating and selling the bonds that sealed the deal with the French government. Before doing so, Baring asked for approval from the British government for such a vast expansion of the United States, through Henry Addington, the British prime minister.

- The thrust south and west was far more than just planters searching for fresh land. Expansion served many interests: of a rapidly consolidating state, of western farmers hoping for an outlet to the sea, of manufacturers’ need for raw materials, and of British economic and political desires. As industrial capitalism expanded, the zone of war capitalism continued to push outward. ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2618))
- To make the land useful to planters, this newly consolidated territory needed to be removed from the control of its native inhabitants. Already in the early 1800s, the Creeks, under duress, had given up claims to land in Georgia that was then converted into cotton farms. A decade later the Creeks suffered further defeats and were forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson, ceding 23 million acres of land in what is today Alabama and Georgia. ([Location 2621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2621))
- In the years after 1814, the federal government signed further treaties with the Creeks, Chickasaw, and Choctaws, gaining control over millions of acres of land in the South, including Andrew Jackson’s 1818 treaty with the Chickasaw nation that opened western Tennessee to cotton cultivation and the 1819 treaty with the Choctaw nation that gave 5 million acres of land in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta to the United States in exchange for vastly inferior lands in Oklahoma and Arkansas.

- In 1838, federal troops began removing the Cherokee nation from their ancestral homeland in Georgia, which was to be turned into cotton plantations. ([Location 2635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2635))
- Farther south, in Florida, extraordinarily rich cotton lands were expropriated from the Seminoles between 1835 and 1842, the longest war in U.S. history until the Vietnam War. ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2636))
- The coercion and violence required to mobilize slave labor was matched only by the demands of an expansionist war against indigenous people. Nothing of this kind had even been dreamed of in Anatolia or Gujarat. ([Location 2645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2645))
- America’s remarkably cheap transportation costs were not preordained, but the direct result of the expansion of its national territory. Most significant here was the Mississippi, whose surge of cotton freight turned New Orleans, at the river’s mouth, into the key American cotton port. But other rivers—the Red River in Louisiana and the Tombigbee and Mobile in Alabama—mattered as well. The first steamboats appeared on the Mississippi in 1817, reducing transport costs, and by the 1830s, railroads connected the new hinterland to river and seaports. The most modern technologies thus made the most brutal exploitation of human labor possible. ([Location 2648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2648))
- The insatiable demand of cotton planters dominated the politics of the new nation, not just because of their reliance on the state to secure and empty new land, but also because of their need for coerced labor. Planters in the United States, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed access to large supplies of cheap labor—what the American Cotton Planter would call “the cheapest and most available labor in the world.” Cotton, until the advent of mechanized harvesting during the 1940s, was a labor-intensive crop. Even more than the hours required to spin and weave, the shortage of workers to harvest was the most constraining factor in its production. ([Location 2654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2654))
- In the complex agricultural structures of Mughal India and the Ottoman Empire, rural cultivators had to first secure subsistence crops for their own use, thus limiting what they harvested for the market. ([Location 2660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2660))
- Indeed, as we have seen, the shortage of labor had been one of the principal constraints on production in western Anatolia and had frustrated efforts to create cotton plantations in India. In Brazil, where slave labor was available, cotton competed poorly with the even greater labor requirements of sugar plantations. And with the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807 it became difficult for West Indian planters to recruit labor. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2662))
- In the United States, however, nearly any shortage could be fixed, with the right amount of money. The slave markets in New Orleans and elsewhere boomed as cotton did. And as significant, hundreds of thousands of slaves were available to grow cotton because tobacco production in the states of the upper South became less profitable after the American Revolution, encouraging slave owners there to sell their human property. ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2667))
- In the thirty years after the invention of the gin alone (between 1790 and 1820), a quarter million slaves were forcefully relocated, while between 1783 and the closing of the international slave trade in 1808, traders imported an estimated 170,000 slaves into the United States—or one-third of all slaves imported into North America since 1619. Altogether, the internal slave trade moved up to a million slaves forcefully to the Deep South, most to grow cotton. ([Location 2676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2676))
- Indeed, 85 percent of all cotton picked in the South in 1860 was grown on units larger than a hundred acres; the planters who owned those farms owned 91.2 percent of all slaves. The larger the farm, the better the planter was able to take advantage of the economies of scale inherent in slave-based cotton production. Larger farms could afford the gins to remove seeds and presses to compress loose cotton into tightly pressed bales to lower shipping costs, they could engage in agricultural experiments to wrest more nutrients from cleared soil, and they could buy more slaves to avoid any labor constraints. ([Location 2685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2685))
- Slave traders, slave pens, slave auctions, and the attendant physical and psychological violence of holding millions in bondage were of central importance to the expansion of cotton production in the United States and of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. ([Location 2691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2691))
- “When the price [of cotton] rises in the English market,” he remembered, “the poor slaves immediately feel the effects, for they are harder driven, and the whip is kept more constantly going.” ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2696))
- So crucial was slave labor that the Liverpool Chronicle and European Times warned that if slaves ever should be emancipated, cotton cloth prices might double or triple, with devastating consequences for Britain. While brutal coercion weighed like a nightmare upon millions of American slaves, the potential end of such violence was a nightmare to those who gathered the fabulous profits of the empire of cotton. ([Location 2704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2704))
- To make such a nightmare less likely, planters in the United States also drew on the third advantage that turned them into the world’s leading cotton growers: political power. ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2711))
- Southern slaveholders had enshrined the basis of their power into the Constitution with its three-fifths clause. A whole series of slaveholding presidents, Supreme Court judges, and strong representation in both houses of Congress guaranteed seemingly never-ending political support for the institution of slavery. Such power on the national level was enabled and also supplemented by the absence of competing elites in the slaveholding states themselves, and the enormous power slaveholders enjoyed over state governments. ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2713))
- These state governments, in the end, also allowed North American cotton planters to amplify their good fortune of navigable rivers near their plantations by building railroads deeper and deeper into the hinterland. ([Location 2717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2717))
- In contrast, Brazilian cotton farmers, competing with the interests of the country’s powerful sugar growers, were unable to command infrastructure improvements to facilitate cotton exports. Transporting cotton over long distances on mules or horses remained expensive; transporting cotton from the São Francisco River region to the port of Salvador, for example, almost doubled the price of cotton. ([Location 2719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2719))
- In India, transportation infrastructure remained similarly poor (it was said that transporting cotton to the port added about 50 percent to its cost in India, but as little as 3 percent in the United States), as cotton merchants and growers in India lacked the capital and power to effect its rapid improvement. ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2723))
- The political influence of slaveholders in the American Republic was also decisive because it allowed them to expand the institution of slavery into the newly acquired territories of the South and Southwest, while successfully committing the federal government to a policy of expropriating Native Americans. ([Location 2725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2725))
- The disjunction of political from economic spaces in fact proved to be crucial for the world’s most dynamic industry—with cotton-growing slave owners dominating regional governments and exerting significant influence on the national government, their interests and the policies of the state could be aligned to a stunning degree, an impossibility for slaveholders within the British Empire. ([Location 2733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2733))
- How these factors came together can be seen, for example, in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta. Here, in an area of approximately seven thousand square miles, the mighty Mississippi had unloaded its rich sediments for millennia, becoming the seedbed of the world’s most productive cotton land. In 1859, as many as sixty thousand Delta slaves produced a staggering 66 million pounds of cotton, nearly ten times as much as was exported from Saint-Domingue to France during the height of its production in the early 1790s. ([Location 2738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2738))

- The plantations they built became substantial businesses: By 1840, Washington County, in the heart of the Delta, counted more than ten slaves for every white inhabitant. By 1850, each and every white family in the county held on average more than eighty slaves.

- As cotton cultivation expanded in the southern United States and as British and eventually continental European consumers became more and more dependent on that supply, institutional links between the South and Europe deepened. European import merchants sent agents to Charleston, Memphis, and New Orleans. They corresponded with business partners across the Atlantic on a regular basis. These merchants built a dense network of shipping connections and integrated the trade in cotton with their other businesses. People engaged in the cotton trade crossed the North Atlantic frequently, forging close business connections, friendships, and even marriages. Such networks, in turn, made… ([Location 2759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2759))
- At the core of all of these networks was the flow of cotton from the United States to Europe and of capital in the opposite direction. This capital more often than not was secured by mortgages on slaves, giving the owners of these… ([Location 2766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2766))
- As historian Bonnie Martin has shown, in Louisiana 88 percent of loans secured by mortgages used slaves as (partial) collateral; in South Carolina it was 82 percent.

Slavery thus allowed not just… ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2768))
- Most significantly, in 1806 a Natchez planter, Walter Burling, brought cottonseeds from Mexico, which had larger bolls that could be more easily picked and, according to experts, “possessed better fiber quality, especially fiber length, and was resistant to ‘rot.’ ” This type of cotton had been cultivated by Native Americans in the central Mexican highlands for centuries, and once brought into the United States it was appropriated by American planters, becoming the “basic germplasm for all subsequent upland cotton cultivars in the United States and around the world.” The new cotton could be picked three to four times as fast as the then common Georgia Green Seed cotton. ([Location 2776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2776))
- The cruel irony was that Amerindians’ ability to develop a strain of cotton well suited for the American environment gave considerable impetus to the expropriation of their lands, and made slave labor on those lands much more productive. ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2782))
- The Industrial Revolution in Europe also actively influenced the evolution of slavery in the American South. Gang labor, by no means new but never so prevalent as on cotton plantations, exemplified the new rhythm of industrial labor, or what one author has called “military agriculture.” The systematic mobilization of slave women and children on cotton farms further expanded their output. As a result, cotton production in the United States increased much faster than the number of slaves employed on farms. Some of that increase was related to the embrace of different cotton plants, but there was also a systematic intensification of exploitation. Plantation slavery in the nineteenth-century United States allowed for an organization of labor unlike what was possible in the world’s newly emerging industrial heartland. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2791))
- productivity gains on plantations could only result from a reorganization of labor. Slave owners secured these productivity gains by taking almost total control of the work process—a direct result of the violent domination of their workers. Nothing of that sort was possible in the world’s emerging textile mills, where workers succeeded in maintaining some of the rhythms of the farms, small workshops, and craft guilds from whence they came.33 The all-encompassing control of workers—a core characteristic of capitalism—experienced its first great success on the cotton plantations of the American South. ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2800))
- Because planters dominated labor in ways radically different from English merchants’ connection to agricultural cultivators in India, or Ottoman landowners in Anatolia, they could drive their slaves ever harder, as they came up with increasingly brutal methods of disciplining their workforce. Indeed, torture, according to historian Edward Baptist, was at the root of the ability of American planters to produce ever more cotton. ([Location 2805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2805))
- And with rising productivity on cotton plantations, prices fell, allowing British manufacturers to become even more competitive in the markets of the world, a move that, among many other things, would eventually undermine manufacturing in India and elsewhere and make the later integration of that countryside into the global cotton empire much easier. ([Location 2812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2812))
- Since the expansion of cotton agriculture depended on the advance of credit, sometimes secured by mortgages on slaves, most of which derived from the London money market, its patterns now followed the competitive logic of markets rather than the whimsy of personal aspiration and regional circumstance—capital moved to wherever cotton could be produced in the greatest quantities and at the cheapest cost. ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2818))
- To the great lament of southern planters, the factor—a merchant who would sell a planter’s cotton, supply him with goods, and provide credit—and with him the London money market, was a decisive source of their wealth and power. ([Location 2822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2822))
- The peculiar combination of expropriated lands, slave labor, and the domination of a state that gave enormous latitude to slave owners over their labor was fabulously profitable for those positioned to embrace it: As early as 1807 a Mississippi cotton plantation was said to return 22.5 percent annually on its investment. ([Location 2831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2831))
- Cotton’s profitability is also revealed by the dramatic increase in the price of slaves: A young adult male slave in New Orleans cost about $500 in 1800, but as much as $1,800 before the Civil War. ([Location 2835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2835))
- Other potential competitors, such as farmers in India, planted cotton on just as much land as North Americans as late as 1850, but their presence on world markets remained marginal. ([Location 2864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2864))
- Already by 1820, cotton constituted 32 percent of all U.S. exports, compared to a minuscule 2.2 percent in 1796. Indeed, more than half of all American exports between 1815 and 1860 consisted of cotton. Cotton so dominated the U.S. economy that cotton production statistics “became an increasingly vital unit in assessing the American economy.” ([Location 2872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2872))
- It was on the back of cotton, and thus on the backs of slaves, that the U.S. economy ascended in the world. ([Location 2874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2874))
- American cotton farmers had succeeded in turning themselves into the world’s most important growers of the industrial age’s most important commodity. Their “gigantic plantations,” observed a British merchant in Tellicherry, India, “now supply the materials for clothing half the civilized world.” ([Location 2883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2883))
- with slave-grown cotton pouring in from the United States, the cost of finished cotton declined, making clothes and sheets affordable for a rapidly expanding market. ([Location 2885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2885))
- Cotton manufacturers understood that their prosperity was entirely dependent on the labor of slaves and they “dreaded the severity of the revulsion which must sooner, or later arrive.” By 1850, one British observer estimated that 3.5 million people in the United Kingdom were employed by the country’s cotton industry—all subject to the whims of American planters and their tenuous hold on their nation’s politics. ([Location 2904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2904))
- Cotton manufacturers’ concerns about dependence on U.S. cotton focused on three issues. First, they feared that the United States would siphon off ever-increasing amounts of its own cotton in its own factories, which had begun to emerge in significant numbers in the 1810s, making less cotton available to European consumers. Second, British manufacturers in particular were concerned that continental producers would acquire a rising percentage of the world’s cotton, competing for American supplies. Third, and most important was “the increasing uncertainty of the continuance of the system of slavery.” Drawing on “the blood-stained produce” constituted a “suicidal dependence” on the “crime of American slavery.” ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2911))
- could the increasingly expansionist designs of wealthy and powerful slaveholders in the American South and their proto-nationalist project be contained within an industrializing United States? Southern planters, the “lords of the lash,” emboldened by their wealth, began to lament their subordinate role within the global economy; their fledgling designs to revolutionize their own position within it were yet another threat to the system as a whole. To the “lords of the loom,” raw material producers had to be politically subordinate to the will and direction of industrial capital. ([Location 2921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2921))
- During these moments of anxiety, European cotton manufacturers looked to other regions of the world for an increased supply of cotton, to places such as Africa and India. French officials eyed Senegal in the 1810s and 1820s as a potential alternative source of cotton, but despite their concerted efforts, little cotton came. In Britain, hopes for non-American cotton focused squarely on India, whose long history of cotton exports seemed to make it superbly suited to supply British factories, not least because manufacturers believed the country had “overflowing supplies of various descriptions of cotton.” And India might point toward ways to build a cotton industry not dependent on the inherent instabilities and exigencies of slavery and expropriations. The possibilities of Indian cotton were enumerated and analyzed in literally dozens of books, ([Location 2938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2938))
- The agitation for Indian cotton reached its height during the 1850s, when prices for U.S. cotton rose once more. To be sure, Manchester cotton interests were still divided on the merits of state intervention to secure Indian cotton, with some believing that things should be left to the market.49 But by 1857 the “adequate supply of cotton being obtained to sustain the industry of this district” had become a major topic of discussion at the Chamber’s annual meetings. ([Location 2963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2963))
- Concerned about the increasing volatility of American politics in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Dred Scott decision, the association literally went to the ends of the earth delivering cotton gins, giving advice, and distributing seeds and implements to farmers, while collecting information on various kinds of cotton and various ways of growing it. The association’s work was a microcosm of the grand project of cotton capitalists: to transform the global countryside into a cotton-growing complex. ([Location 2972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2972))
- Central Indian cotton had been traded to Madras in the south and Bengal in the east, but with the decline of the Indian cotton cloth export industry, it was increasingly brought to Bombay and from there exported to China and, in limited quantities, to Britain. ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=2981))
- As the failed experimental farms had suggested, one important reason was the problematic transportation infrastructure. Cotton was usually brought to market on bullocks and carts, an extremely slow and expensive way to transport the raw material. As late as 1854, there were only thirty-four miles of railroad in India. One expert indeed argued that American cotton was so much more competitive than Indian cotton because of the vastly better system of railroads, and, one should add, a vastly superior system of rivers. ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3068))
- Indian peasants, like their counterparts in Anatolia, western Africa, and elsewhere, had shaped a world in which they could resist the onslaught of European merchant capital. Since Europeans were unable to transfer bodily coercion and all-encompassing expropriation of land to these regions of the world, and since they lacked the power to force some other alternative system of raw material production, much to their lament, their dependence on the United States deepened. ([Location 3132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3132))
- In contrast to India, Egypt contained the possibility for coercion, expropriation, and even slavery. ([Location 3140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3140))
- Ali understood the potential of this new export crop and ordered it grown throughout the country. Coercion was integral to this project from the beginning. Peasants were forced to cultivate cotton on state-owned lands for their yearly corvée duty, a forced-labor tax. On their own lands they were also forced to plant cotton in specific ways, to sell their crop to the state, and to work without pay. The government set prices for the cotton and controlled all aspects of its transport and sale to foreign merchants in Alexandria, who were explicitly disallowed to directly purchase cotton from Egyptian growers. Workers were also forced to dig canals to water the crop and to build roads that crisscrossed Lower Egypt to move it to market. ([Location 3147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3147))
- The Egyptian state also dominated the cotton trade itself. Until the 1850s, in contrast to indebted American planters, Egyptian rulers succeeded in limiting the influence of foreign merchants on the domestic trade in cotton, despite their centrality in organizing the export trade from the Mediteranean port city of Alexandria. The government purchased the cotton at fixed prices, collected it at central warehouses, and then shipped it to Alexandria, where Ali was the only seller of the raw material to foreign merchants. In the 1820s and 1830s, between 10 and 25 percent of the revenues of the Egyptian state derived from this sale of cotton. ([Location 3157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3157))
- Egyptian cotton came to play a significant role in supplying European manufacturers.72 British factory owners noted in 1825 that such exports had “materially checked the advances which lately occurred in the prices of all other Cottons.” But the prime value of Egyptian cotton, they argued, was that it could substitute for American long-staple Sea Island cotton, which they considered important “in the event of any political event depriving us altogether of the Cotton of the United States.” ([Location 3163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3163))
- Instead, cotton flowed ever more cheaply out of the American South. Slavery and the expropriation of native lands, fueled by European capital, combined to feed raw materials relentlessly into Europe’s core industry. The massive infusion of European capital transformed the American countryside; land became wealth, and linked across great distances slaves and wage workers, planters and manufacturers, plantations and factories. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, slavery had become central to the Western world’s new political economy. But this capitalism, based on territorial expansion and violent domination of labor, was also inherently unstable: As the Bremer Handelsblatt put it in 1853, “the material prosperity of Europe hangs on a thread of cotton. Would slavery suddenly be abolished, cotton production would fall at one stroke by 5⁄6th, and all cotton industries would be ruined.” ([Location 3172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3172))
- Indeed, the cheapness of cottons enabled by slavery in the United States would help undermine local manufacturing everywhere. Many times over, indeed, the empire of cotton would advance what historian Kären Wigen has called the “making of a periphery.” Tench Coxe understood that process already in 1818: The export of British piece goods to India, he perceptively observed, would force Indians “to turn to raising cotton instead of making piece goods they cannot sell.” Across the nineteenth century, Europeans gambled on the efficacy of war capitalism again and again; each time they succeeded in planting new fields, in coercing more slaves, in finding additional capital, they enabled the production of more cotton fabrics at cheaper prices, and they pushed their cotton rivals to the periphery. The destruction of each of these alternative circuits of cotton, in turn, would further tip the balance of power in many parts of the world’s countryside, making more territory and more labor vulnerable to the encroachment of the global economy. The great irony of this rapacious cycle of war capitalism, as we will see, is that its success laid the foundation for its own demise.

- by 1860, mills could be found throughout Europe, North America, India, Mexico, and Brazil. While that year the United Kingdom still controlled 67.4 percent of the world’s mechanical spindles, cotton spinning by machines had effectively replaced older ways of doing things in large areas of the world. ([Location 3308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3308))
- In the United States, cotton mills opened in Rhode Island (1790), New Jersey (1791), Delaware (1795), New Hampshire (1803), New York (1803), Connecticut (1804), and Maryland (1810). In 1810, according to the U.S. census, there were 269 cotton establishments in the United States with a total of 87,000 spindles. By 1860, there would be 5 million spindles, making cotton textiles the United States’ most important manufacturing industry in terms of capital invested, workers employed, and net value of its product.

- As we have seen in Britain, this industrial capitalism was a radical departure from the life of centuries prior. It was one thing for British tinkerers and putting-out merchants to stumble upon a new way of spinning cotton in the last decades of the eighteenth century. But it was an entirely different thing to scale that model by several orders of magnitude and forge it into a new social order. It was the capacity of a newly emerging type of state, as we will see, that was decisive. ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3347))
- First and foremost, these early adopters all had a prior history of textile manufacturing. While no guarantee of success, such prior experience was all but required for cotton industrialization. Spinning mills almost always arose in areas that had already sustained vibrant textile industries—no matter if in woolens, flax, or cottons, urban or rural, home-based or in workshops. ([Location 3353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3353))
- in the United States, New England’s textile mills arose in areas in which women especially had a long tradition of spinning yarn and weaving textiles; ([Location 3362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3362))
- In the United States, for example, as in England itself, industrialization was led by basic manufacturing, namely spinning, moving next into weaving and, later, printing, the application of colorful designs on cotton cloth imported from elsewhere. ([Location 3369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3369))
- As the age’s most dynamic industry, cotton manufacturing provided ample opportunities for social mobility. Swiss cotton manufacturer Heinrich Kunz started out as a wage worker, but at the time of his death in 1859 he owned eight spinning mills with 150,000 spindles, employing two thousand workers.16 ([Location 3413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3413))
- Mill owners in the United States also often rose from the ranks of small merchants and skilled artisans. Rhode Island’s Samuel Slater had apprenticed himself in England, oversaw other factories, and then migrated to the United States in 1789. Once there, he entered into a partnership with Providence merchant Moses Brown, who was rich from the West Indian provisioning trade and was trying to introduce mechanical spinning in the Browns’ Pawtucket factory. Slater proceeded to build British-designed machines from memory, and in December 1790 the factory produced its first yarn. The energetic Slater soon expanded operations, built additional mills, and eventually accumulated sufficient wealth to create his own company in 1799. By 1806 the Rhode Island countryside was graced by the village of Slatersville. ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3417))
- the Associates of the Boston Manufacturing Company,” which created a huge integrated spinning and weaving mill in Waltham near Boston, initially capitalized at $400,000, or a bit more than 2 million francs. The mill focused on inexpensive coarse cotton goods, some of which were sold to clothe slaves, replacing Indian manufactured cloth. (So common did Lowell cloth become among slaves that “Lowell” became the generic term slaves used to describe coarse cottons.) The venture proved hugely profitable, with dividends in most years above 10 percent on the paid-in capital. In 1817, the mills paid peak dividends of 17 percent. By 1823, the Boston Associates expanded further, building more mills in Lowell, about twenty-five miles north of Boston, and creating the largest integrated mills anywhere in the world. This move of American merchant capital into manufacturing marked another tight connection between slavery and industry. ([Location 3449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3449))
- Early cotton industrialists such as the Cabot, Brown, and Lowell families all had ties to the slave trade, the West Indian provision trade, and the trade in agricultural commodities grown by slaves. The “lords of the lash” and the “lords of the loom” were, yet again, tightly linked. ([Location 3457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3457))
- Similar incursions happened in Catalonia, in northwestern Europe, and in the German lands, challenging budding capitalists, rulers, and bureaucrats to embrace mechanized manufacturing. Failure to do so, in effect, meant giving up on cotton, and forgoing what had become a significant source of wealth and, increasingly, a precondition for being “modern.” Yet rulers and capitalists in many parts of the world, as we will see, were unable to respond. ([Location 3542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3542))
- British competition was a strong incentive to embark upon something radically new, but no manufacturer could do so without British technology. Though the British government tried to hold on to its monopoly, that technology spread rapidly due to active programs of private and government-directed industrial espionage as well as the unstoppable outflow of skilled British workers and cotton capitalists eager to make their fortunes in new lands. Between the invention of new machines in Britain and their spread elsewhere there was typically only a ten-year lag. ([Location 3547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3547))
- What the British example also shows is the importance of the state’s capacity to forge conditions conducive to industrialization. Without a powerful state capable of legally, bureaucratically, infrastructurally, and militarily penetrating its own territory, industrialization was all but impossible. Forging markets, protecting domestic industry, creating tools to raise revenues, policing borders, and fostering changes that allowed for the mobilization of wage workers were crucial. Indeed, the capacity of states to foster a domestic cotton industry turns out to be the key division between places that industrialized and those that did not. The map of modern states corresponds almost perfectly to the map of regions that saw early cotton industrialization. ([Location 3627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3627))
- Yet monopolies, subsidies, and the provision of expertise all proved to be fairly minor interventions, sufficient to allow the building of one factory or another, but not enough to embark upon the creation of a significant domestic cotton industry. ([Location 3652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3652))
- Much more important was a state’s ability to isolate its domestic manufacturing efforts from competition, especially from Britain. But only a few states in the early nineteenth century enjoyed the capacity to police their external borders. ([Location 3655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3655))
- the first wave of mechanized cotton spinning came to continental Europe as a direct result of the ability of the expanding French revolutionary republic to keep British manufactured goods from the continent. The blockade of British trade, from November 1806 to April 1814, provided the single most important impetus for continental European cotton industrialization, protecting feeble beginnings so that they could become a full-fledged industry. Just at the moment when the continental cotton industry struggled to emerge, Napoleon’s policy isolated it from the devastating competition of English manufacturers; French spinning and weaving operations soon took off. ([Location 3657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3657))
- With Jefferson’s Embargo Act of 1807, which blocked the shipment of goods between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, British textile imports largely disappeared from the market, providing new opportunities to American spinners and weavers: The number of mechanical spindles in the United States increased from 8,000 in 1807 to 130,000 in 1815. There were fifteen cotton mills in 1806, and sixty-two in 1809, with another twenty-five under construction. This astonishing and highly profitable increase encouraged merchants, including Francis Cabot Lowell in Boston, to shift ever more capital into cotton manufacturing. ([Location 3680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3680))
- develop industries. Wright Armitage was partly wrong. In the United States, a new tariff provided the cotton industry with some protection as early as 1816. Other parts of the world followed suit. In France, “prohibitive tariffs” followed the end of the continental blockade. Prussia and Austria imposed import duties on cotton goods in 1818, Russia in 1820, France in 1822, Italy in 1824, and Bavaria and Württemberg in 1826. France went so far that in 1842 it prohibited the importation of all cotton goods onto its national territory. Protectionism, once seen as a wartime cataclysm, now became a permanent feature of newly industrializing states—who in this respect followed the British example, as Britain had protected its home market from Indian competition just as furiously. ([Location 3694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3694))
- The successful forging of industrial capitalism thus rested as much on the capacity of states to create a framework in which manufacturing could thrive as on entrepreneurial initiative. Beyond protectionism, states also played a crucial role in market making by removing internal duties. ([Location 3749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3749))
- But most important of all was the road building, canal digging, and railway construction that characterized assertive states in the first half of the nineteenth century. These infrastructure projects greatly facilitated the circulation of goods, people, and information, and thus allowed for the emergence of larger and much more integrated markets. ([Location 3754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3754))
- As a result, industrial capitalism, the most revolutionary invention of all, traveled only in very particular ways. The capitalists who managed to follow the British example usually worked within states that embraced the industrialization project and saw national manufacturing as a way to strengthen the state, forging in the process a new relationship between economic activity and national territory. In these states, rulers, bureaucrats, and capitalists could penetrate bounded territories legally, bureaucratically, infrastructurally, and militarily to create conditions that allowed for long-term capital investments, the mobilization of labor, expanding domestic and foreign markets, and protection for national industries from the uncertainties of the global economy. ([Location 3807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3807))
- By 1835 there were roughly fifteen hundred cotton manufacturers (some of whom owned multiple mills), and by 1860, four thousand manufacturers owned cotton mills in the British Isles. ([Location 3825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3825))
- The secrets of British success in the face of protectionism elsewhere were twofold. For one, British manufacturers focused on higher-quality yarn and cloth, since they lacked competition from technologically less advanced manufacturers elsewhere. And Britain increasingly depended on markets in colonial or semicolonial areas of the world. ([Location 3830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3830))
- The British cotton trade avoided the stronger states that could protect their own emerging industries, gravitating instead toward markets that were unable to politically resist the British onslaught. ([Location 3834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3834))
- The tremendous rapacity and unbalanced consequences of war capitalism left in its wake a great diversity: Some states were strengthened, while others were weakened and unable to invest in infrastructure, administrative capacity, and protections of industry. Some states had astounding capacities to manufacture goods on a mass scale; others remained embedded in preindustrial, housebound production. On the one hand, slavery, land expropriations, militarized trade, and colonial expansion had opened up vast new territories and labor pools for cotton growing and created new markets of tremendous vitality. They had helped limit competition in global markets, radically stimulating the international flow of goods, and thus making the project of industrialization the possession of a few privileged parts of the world. They were also at the root of a vast strengthening of states that enabled a few of them to forge the institutions of industrial capitalism. Indeed, the imperial extension of European state power over the globe and its intensification within Europe itself were mutually constitutive for a short but decisive moment. ([Location 3837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3837))
- On the other hand, colonial expansion, the slave trade, and slavery itself undermined state capacity in other parts of the world and in so doing limited the likelihood that the newfangled machines, and with them industrial capitalism, would take root there as well. ([Location 3846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3846))
- One expert estimated that by the 1830s Egypt was fifth in the world regarding cotton spindles per capita, when it counted about 80 mechanized spindles per one thousand population compared to 588 in Great Britain, 265 in Switzerland, 97 in the United States, 90 in France, and 17 in Mexico. ([Location 3877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3877))
- By the 1850s, Egypt’s cotton industry had essentially disappeared, its countryside littered with factory ruins. Egypt was never able to build the institutional framework that would have enabled a full transition to industrial capitalism; even something so basic as wage labor did not take hold. Its reliance on war capitalism, both in the cotton fields and in the cotton factories, ultimately limited the growth of domestic markets. Egypt was, moreover, in the end unable to protect its domestic market. British merchants worked hard to open Egyptian markets for their goods, as Egypt weakened vis-à-vis European powers. The value of British cotton goods exports to Egypt increased by an estimated factor of ten between the second half of the 1820s and the second half of the 1830s. When in 1838 the Anglo-Ottoman Tariff Treaty went into force, setting import duties at only 8 percent ad valorem (that is, a percentage on the value of the product), and in effect forcing free trade upon Egypt, it “destroyed its first mechanized textile industry.” Combined with the state’s difficulties running cotton mills and the problem of securing sufficient fuel for steam-powered production, a system of “free trade” dominated by Britain made it practically impossible for Egypt to industrialize. Egypt’s cotton industry was devastated from two sides: its domestic embrace of war capitalism and its ultimate subjugation to British imperialism. The Egyptian state was powerful domestically, but weak when it came to defining Egypt’s position within the global economy, no match for British interests and designs. ([Location 3916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3916))
- However, a society dominated by slavery was not conducive to cotton industrialization. Early industrialization depended, globally, on war capitalism, but in regions of the globe in which war capitalism took on its most violent edge cotton industrialization never resulted. Cuba, for example, relied on a massive number of enslaved workers, and yet did not have a single cotton mill during the entire nineteenth century.69 The state of war between private parties at the heart of war capitalism contradicted the emerging imperatives of industrial capitalism. It was thus not just the capacity of states that explains the spread of cotton manufacturing, but also the distribution of power within them. Slave states were notoriously late and feeble in supporting the political and economic interests of domestic industrializers. ([Location 3965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3965))
- This was also the case in the slave territories within the United States, the only country in the world divided between war and industrial capitalism, a unique characteristic that would eventually spark an unprecedentedly destructive civil war. In the southern United States, one of the world’s most dynamic slave economies, there was little cotton industrialization before the 1880s. To be sure, during and after the Revolutionary War some mechanized cotton manufacturing emerged in the southern states, and during the 1830s and thereafter a few textile mills opened their doors. But as late as 1850, southern cotton mills only consumed seventy-eight thousand bales of cotton, or one-sixth of the cotton consumption of New England. Further expansion of manufacturing, just as in Brazil, was hampered by the thriving slave economy that concentrated capital, labor, and entrepreneurial talent on plantations, limited the size of markets, made the region unattractive to European immigrants, and did not force white yeoman farmers into wage work (unlike, say, in New England and the Black Forest). ([Location 3972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3972))
- Colonialism, by undermining the state capacity of colonized territories and making them subservient to the interests of the colonizers, was decisive. Huge domestic demand in India, unlike in continental Europe, did not lead to state investment or protection—despite access to cotton, capital, and abundant skill. ([Location 3988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=3988))
- Colonialism, the embrace of slavery, the expropriation of lands—war capitalism, in short—had enabled the rise of industrial capitalism in some parts of the world, while at the same time making its emergence much less likely everywhere else. Industrial capitalism rested, as we have seen, on a combination of capital and state power—creating markets and mobilizing capital and labor in novel ways. ([Location 4008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=4008))
- Crucial to this phase in the history of capitalism was the very diversity of its forms. Capitalism rested on the coexistence of war capitalism, with its violent expropriation of land and labor, its peculiar state, and the uncoordinated and unrestrained initiatives of its leading capitalists, with industrial capitalism, with its administratively, infrastructurally, legally and militarily powerful states channeling private initiative. ([Location 4014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=4014))
- New ways of raising capital, new ways of inserting capital into production, new forms of labor mobilization, new forms of market making, and, last but not least, new forms of the incorporation of land and people into the global capitalist economy would emerge from this fertile yet often violent, even barbaric intersection of war and industrial capitalism. From the 1860s on, capital backed by state power rather than masters backed by expropriation and private physical coercion, would colonize territories and people. ([Location 4023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=4023))
- One of the greatest institutional innovations brought about by capitalists’ and statesmen’s embrace of industrial capitalism, however, was the invention of new forms of labor mobilization. While capitalism’s vast labor in the Americas had been accomplished by enslaved Africans, the huge labor needs of manufacturing industries were met by creating a powerful new system of wage labor. Though wage labor was not free of extralegal coercion, it was a new way to mobilize massive amounts of labor. It put laborers and labor on an entirely different legal, social, and institutional basis—and the ability to do so was the next factor that set some parts of the world apart from others. ([Location 4036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=4036))
- Raw cotton was also by far the most important export good of the United States: In 1820, the value of U.S. cotton exports was some $22 million; leaf tobacco was valued at $8 million, and wheat at less than $500,000. Cotton constituted about 31 percent of U.S. merchandise exports by value. By 1860, the value of tobacco exports had doubled, and wheat exports had increased by a factor of eight—but cotton had mushroomed nearly nine times to $192 million. It now constituted nearly 60 percent of the value of all merchandise exports. As merchants built the world’s first truly global economy, cotton took center stage. ([Location 4657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=4657))
- One author boldly estimated that in 1862, fully 20 million people worldwide—one out of every sixty-five people alive—were involved in the cultivation of cotton or the production of cotton cloth. In England alone, which still counted two-thirds of the world’s mechanical spindles in its factories, the livelihood of between one-fifth and one-fourth of the population was based on the industry; one-tenth of all British capital was invested in it, and close to one-half of all exports consisted of cotton yarn and cloth. ([Location 5454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5454))
- On the eve of the Civil War, raw cotton constituted 61 percent of the value of all U.S. products shipped abroad. Before the beginnings of the cotton boom in the 1780s, North America had been a promising but marginal player in the global economy. Now, in 1861, the flagship of global capitalism, Great Britain, found itself dangerously dependent on the white gold shipped out of New York, New Orleans, Charleston, and other American ports. By the late 1850s, cotton grown in the United States accounted for 77 percent of the 800 million pounds of cotton consumed in Britain. It also accounted for 90 percent of the 192 million pounds used in France, 60 percent of the 115 million pounds spun in the Zollverein, and 92 percent of the 102 million pounds manufactured in Russia. ([Location 5465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5465))
- The reason for America’s quick ascent to market dominance was simple. The United States more than any other country had elastic supplies of the three crucial ingredients that went into the production of raw cotton: labor, land, and credit. ([Location 5472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5472))
- Poet John Greenleaf Whittier called it the “Haschish of the West,” a drug that was creating powerful hallucinatory dreams of territorial expansion, of judges who decide that “right is wrong,” of heaven as “a snug plantation” with “angel negro overseers.” ([Location 5478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5478))
- Whether celebrating the material advances generated from slavery or calling for slavery’s abolition, many contemporaries agreed by the 1850s that global economic development required physical coercion. Karl Marx sharpened the arguments made all around him by concluding in 1853 that “bourgeois civilization” and “barbarity” were joined at the hip.

- As South Carolina senator and cotton planter James Henry Hammond put it famously on the floor of the Senate, “England would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her” if the system of slave-powered cotton growing would be threatened. “No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is king.” ([Location 5494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5494))
- Ample supplies of fertile land and bonded labor had made the South into Lancashire’s plantation, but by 1860 large numbers of Americans, especially in the northern states, protested such semicolonial dependence. They, in time, sparked a second American revolution. Fearing for the security of their human property, southern slave owners struck out on their own, gambling that their European partners would intervene to preserve the world economy and with it their own exceptionally profitable role.

- Yet from a global perspective, the outbreak of war between the Confederacy and the Union in April 1861 was a struggle not only over American territorial integrity and the future of its “peculiar institution,” but also over global capitalism’s dependence on slave labor across the world. The Civil War in the United States was an acid test for the entire industrial order: Could it adapt to the even temporary loss of its providential partner—the expansive, slave-powered antebellum United States—before social chaos and economic collapse brought their empire to ruins? ([Location 5525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5525))
- With its shocking duration and destructiveness, the American struggle marked the world’s first truly global raw materials crisis, and proved midwife to the emergence of new global networks of labor, capital, and state power. Thus one of the most important chapters in the history of global capital and labor unfolded on the battlefields of provincial North America. ([Location 5540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5540))
- In an effort to force British diplomatic recognition, the Confederate government banned all cotton exports. By the time the Confederacy realized this policy was doomed, a northern blockade effectively kept most cotton from leaving the South. Though smuggling persisted, and most smugglers’ runs succeeded, the blockade’s deterrent effects removed most cotton-carrying ships from the southern trade. Consequently, exports to Europe fell from 3.8 million bales in 1860 to virtually nothing in 1862. The effects of the resulting “cotton famine,” as it came to be known, quickly rippled outward, reshaping industry—and the larger society—in places ranging from Manchester to Alexandria. ([Location 5545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5545))
- By early 1862, as total imports of cotton into Britain fell by a little over 50 percent compared to the previous year, and imports from the United States by 96 percent, mills began shutting down for a few days each week, or entirely. Cotton prices had quadrupled from their prewar levels and, consequently, manufacturers closed shops and tens of thousands of operatives found themselves out of work. As early as November 1861, Lancashire manufacturers had shut 6 percent of their factories and introduced shorter shifts in two-thirds of them. By early 1863, a quarter of the inhabitants of Lancashire—more than half a million individuals—were out of work, receiving some form of public or private assistance. ([Location 5567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5567))
- By 1863, unemployed workers rioted in the streets of several British cotton towns, underscoring the explosive social consequences of the cotton famine. ([Location 5576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5576))
- Similar crises unfolded on the European continent. In France, manufacturers closed mills because they could not afford high cotton prices as imports of U.S. cotton fell from more than 600,000 bales in 1860 to 4,169 in 1863. The effect was especially severe on manufacturers of coarse cottons, such as the ones in Normandy, for whom the price of cotton determined much of the total price of production. By 1863, three-fifths of the looms in Normandy were idle, while in the districts of Colmar and Belfort, where higher-quality cottons were produced, 35 percent of all spindles and 41 percent of all looms remained unused. That same year, a French national relief committee estimated that a quarter million textile workers were unemployed. ([Location 5583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5583))
- Lesser cotton centers also experienced severe distress: In the German lands of the Zollverein, imports of raw cotton fell by about 50 percent between 1861 and 1864 and hundreds of factory owners sent their workers home. Of the approximately three hundred thousand people engaged in the cotton industry in Saxony alone, one-third had lost their jobs by the fall of 1863, while the rest worked much shorter hours.

- In the northern part of the United States, removed from battle itself but not its consequences, tens of thousands of cotton workers lost employment, but the social effects were less severe because many found employment in the booming woolen mills that produced clothing for the Union army, or enlisted.

- In Moscow, however, 75 percent of all cotton spinning operations had shut down by 1863. ([Location 5596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5596))
- As price volatility and speculation spread, so too did traders’ efforts to institutionalize speculative market transactions, especially forward selling. By 1863, the Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association had created a standard form that could be used by merchants making contracts about the future delivery of cotton, and Liverpool newspapers began reporting forward prices of Indian cotton. That year, “time bargains” had even begun to be established in Bombay, providing new opportunities for “men afflicted with a passion for gambling.” The war, in fact, resulted “in a revolutionary modernization of trade” in which the establishment of a formal futures market was perhaps the most important element.

- Since the 1780s, raw cotton markets had been decisively dominated by merchants, but now cotton had become a matter of state, a state empowered not least by decades of merchant political mobilization. Heavy investments in industrial production, a novelty in human history, demanded a constant supply of land, labor, and money. As political leaders grappled with the cotton famine, they saw that the emergence of industrial capitalism had made them just as dependent on a predictable supply of cheap raw materials as the manufacturers themselves.

- The bombardment of Fort Sumter, however, announced that India’s hour had come. For cotton merchants, manufacturers, and statesmen, no place seemed more promising a source of cotton than India. Indeed, it was “the only remedy for the misery that appeared to be hanging over us,” according to Edmund Potter of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. During the American Civil War, British cotton capitalists and colonial bureaucrats worked feverishly to increase India’s cotton output and move it to market. “Cotton,” as one observer wrote from Nagpore in July 1861, “appears to me to be the leading topic of the day,” and the English-language press of India was filled with hundreds if not thousands of stories about cotton. Manchester manufacturers shipped cottonseed to Bombay to be distributed to growers; they moved cotton gins and cotton presses into the countryside; and they talked about investing in railroads to remove cotton to the coast.

- Ashworth and others pressed a newly receptive British government for massive infrastructure investments, changes in criminal codes to make the adulteration of cotton a crime, and new property laws to create clearly defined and easily marketable property in land. ([Location 5678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5678))
- The British government and manufacturers agreed that the administrative, legal, and infrastructural capacity of the imperial state needed to be pushed into the Indian countryside. Perhaps most important was manufacturers’ pressure to create a new kind of legal environment in order to facilitate European investment in and domination of cotton production. ([Location 5687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5687))
- Such a system would permit cultivators to devote their efforts entirely to cash crops, since advances would allow them to purchase food grains before their own cotton crop ripened. Eventually this pressure succeeded; new contract laws were imposed. In 1863, moreover, criminal laws were enacted that made the adulteration of cotton a crime punishable by imprisonment at hard labor. ([Location 5694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5694))
- Such market making went hand in hand with physical infrastructure projects serving both the interests of the “Manchester people” and the colonial state, especially the construction of railroads, which, as Charles Wood remarked, would not only move cotton to ports but also allow for the quick movement of troops to subdue rebellions. During the first year of the war alone, government expenditures on infrastructure projects in India nearly doubled.

- Their decades-old calls for more state intervention now took on nearly hysterical tones, hastening the emergence of an even tighter relationship between merchants, manufacturers, and the imperial state, a relationship that became the hallmark of the empire of cotton during the last third of the nineteenth century and beyond. ([Location 5711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5711))
- The effectiveness of government interventions was furthered by rapidly rising prices that lubricated the often balky transition to world market production. The value of Indian cotton more than quadrupled during the first two years of the war. As a result, Indian cultivators began planting cotton on newly cleared land as well as on land once devoted to food crops. ([Location 5752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5752))
- Whereas India had only contributed 16 percent of Britain’s supply of raw cotton in 1860, and 1.1 percent of France’s in 1857, it contributed 75 percent in 1862 in Britain and as much as 70 percent in France. Some of this cotton had been diverted from domestic use and competing foreign markets (especially China), while the rest was the result of a 50 percent increase in production. ([Location 5757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5757))
- The explosive growth of Bombay can indeed be traced to the Civil War years, as Indian cotton left its old channels of trade into Bengal and moved toward the great European entrepôt. By 1863, ships burdened with cotton even sailed out of Bombay harbor to New York. ([Location 5762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5762))
- The wave of activity that transformed parts of India also rippled through Egypt’s lower Nile Delta. In response to the desperate search by cotton manufacturers for new sources of raw cotton, the Ottoman viceroy Muhammad Sa’id Pasha quickly set about converting his own large landholdings into vast cotton farms. According to Massachusetts cotton manufacturer Edward Atkinson, Muhammad Sa’id became at a stroke “the largest and best cultivator of cotton in the world,” but unbeknownst to Atkinson, he did so in the context of an enormous wave of coercion and violence descending on the Egyptian countryside, including the importation of additional slaves from the Sudan.

- during the American Civil War, merchants, manufacturers, and statesmen glimpsed the future shape of the empire of cotton. They engaged, as Samuel B. Ruggles explained to the New York Chamber of Commerce, in a “great effort for the commercial emancipation of the civilized nations of the earth.”40 Because of them, Indian, Egyptian, and Brazilian cotton became a major presence on Western markets. ([Location 5818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5818))
- the cotton famine sharply raised the dependence of these cotton capitalists on the state and on their own political sophistication. Colonialism had become a matter of urgent self-interest, as capitalists grasped how vulnerable their global networks and huge capital investments were to local disruption and how unstable slavery had become. ([Location 5824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5824))
- Some cotton manufacturers and merchants in Europe went as far as to hope for a permanent separation of the Union to enable the continued growing of cotton by slaves in an internationally recognized Confederacy. They believed that the cotton empire depended for the foreseeable future on slavery. ([Location 5833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5833))
- Many of the propertied in Great Britain similarly opposed the northern cause, motivated by antidemocratic attitudes and a preference for a divided and weakened power in North America, yet concerns about cotton certainly came into their calculations as well: ([Location 5840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5840))
- Tellingly, Liverpool, the world’s largest cotton port, was the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself. Liverpool merchants helped bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union navy, built warships for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit. ([Location 5844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5844))
- Liverpool was not alone. In Manchester, the Southern Club and the Manchester Southern Independence Association agitated for the South. In 1862, thousands of participants, some of them workers, staged rallies in British cotton towns, demanding government recognition of the Confederacy. Even though many workers supported the Union as its struggle became increasingly identified with the struggle for free labor, elite sentiment tended to favor the Confederacy with the president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce expressing his expectation that “permanent secession of the Southern States was inevitable.” ([Location 5851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5851))
- The Union, which had an overwhelming interest in maintaining the neutrality of European governments, took the threat seriously. The Confederacy, for its part, saw gaining international recognition as its single most important foreign policy goal. Of course there were good reasons not to intervene: Britain had to consider the fate of its Canadian provinces, and its growing dependence on wheat and corn imports from the northern United States, while continental powers such as France, Russia, and Prussia had an interest in maintaining a strong United States to balance British economic and military power. ([Location 5863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5863))
- Before becoming prime minister of Great Britain, William Gladstone, among others, cited this fear of social upheaval in Lancashire as a reason for European intervention in the American conflict. ([Location 5871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5871))
- Cotton interests constantly pressured the Lincoln administration to keep the needs of European cotton consumers in mind. ([Location 5876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5876))
- by mid-1862, as the cabinet discussed Lincoln’s plan for emancipation of slaves in rebel states, Seward argued successfully against such “immediate promulgation” and “strongly in favor of cotton and foreign governments.” Seward feared that announcement of emancipation would lead to European recognition of the Confederacy. His ears close to the ground, he recognized the potentially revolutionary implications of the American struggle to global capitalism and urged caution. ([Location 5885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5885))
- Indeed, the best way to make the war against the Confederacy palatable to powerful cotton interests in Europe was to demonstrate that inexpensive cotton could be secured elsewhere. And the U.S. government indeed did its best to encourage production in other parts of the world, for example by moving vast quantities of cottonseed abroad. ([Location 5913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5913))
- Seward projected confidence that such efforts would succeed and especially emphasized the unforeseen effects of global cotton production on the South’s bid for independence. “The insurrectionary cotton States will be blind to their own welfare if they do not see how their prosperity and all their hopes are passing away, when they find Egypt, Asia Minor and India supplying the world with cotton, and California furnishing the gold for its purchase.” ([Location 5925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5925))
- By 1863, widespread cotton imports from India had alleviated the cotton crisis in France. Indeed by early 1864 the procureurs généraux of various cotton manufacturing districts could report that cotton imports from India and Egypt had relieved pressure on manufacturers, as factories started slowly to produce again and, as a result, “the struggle…lost a great deal of interest in our département.”50 As Seward put it a few years after the war, in 1872, when he came to the Indian city of Agra—the site of the Taj Mahal—to visit a cotton gin there, “From the tomb of the Mogul monarch Of India, Akbar, we passed to the tomb of the pretended monarch of America, King Cotton.”51 ([Location 5934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5934))
- Some even began to see the obstinacy of the South, in its demands for independence and its attachment to slavery, as the real cause of disruption to the world economy. After all, cotton merchants and manufacturers, unlike southern planters and their government, were not invested in a particular source of cotton—the American South—nor in a particular system of labor to produce it—slavery. All they required was a secure and predictable supply of inexpensive cotton in the qualities they desired. ([Location 5947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KAFVOUA&location=5947))
