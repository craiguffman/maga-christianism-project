### Highlights

- The house embodied for him the general blessedness of his life, which was manifest, really indisputable. And which he never failed to acknowledge, especially when it stood over against particular sorrow. ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=34))
- Their father said if they could see as God can, in geological time, they would see it leap out of the ground and turn in the sun and spread its arms and bask in the joys of being an oak tree in Iowa. There had once been four swings suspended from those branches, announcing to the world the fruitfulness of their household. The oak tree flourished still, and of course there had been and there were the apple and cherry and apricot trees, the lilacs and trumpet vines and the day lilies. A few of her mother’s irises managed to bloom. At Easter she and her sisters could still bring in armfuls of flowers, and their father’s eyes would glitter with tears and he would say, “Ah yes, yes,” as if they had brought some memento, these flowers only a pleasant reminder of flowers. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=46))
- Even as children they had been good in fact, but also in order to be seen as good. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=81))
- The past was a very fine thing, in its place. But her returning now, to stay, as her father said, had turned memory portentous. To have it overrun its bounds this way and become present and possibly future, too—they all knew this was a thing to be regretted. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=98))
- Perhaps in the whole of her life she had never really distinguished the secret from the sacred, and loved tact and discretion better than she should. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=218))
- She was about to enter her sixteenth year of gentle life in a quiet place, which meant only that her passions and convictions were uncomplicated and potent, that they strove together like figures in allegory. Truth must be stalwart, Loyalty absolute, Generosity unstinting, while Appearance and Convention were children of the giant Hypocrisy and must be put to flight. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=224))
- Her parents were, in their way, fully as innocent as she was, having put aside their innocence on practical grounds, not in the belief that it had been discredited, but because they accepted the terms of life in this world as a treaty to be preferred to conflict, though by no means ideal in itself. Experience had taught them that truth had sharp edges and hard corners, and could be seriously at odds with kindness. They had learned that excessive devotion to even the highest things seemed and probably was sanctimonious, and that the one sufficient measure of excess was that look of annoyance, confirmed in themselves by a twinge of embarrassment, that meant the line had been crossed. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=234))
- But oh, the evenings were long. I am thirty-eight years old, she would say to herself, as she tidied up after supper. I have a master’s degree. I taught high school English for thirteen years. I was a good teacher. What have I done with my life? What has become of it? It is as if I had a dream of adult life and woke up from it, still here in my parents’ house. Of ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=271))
- She used to ask herself, What more could I wish? But she always distrusted that question, because she knew there were limits to her experience that precluded her knowing what there was to be wished. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=282))
- It was Hope who told her that clergy were only and always men, excepting Aimee Semple McPherson, who proved the rule. But she knew how things were before she was told. No bright child could fail to know. None of this had mattered much through all the years of her studies and her teaching, but now, in the middle of any night, it was part of the loneliness she felt, as if the sense that everything could have been otherwise were a palpable darkness. Darkness visible. That was Milton. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=289))
- Those grown children had, almost all of them, bent their heads over whatever work she gave them, even though their bodies were awkward and restless with the onset of adulthood, fate creeping through their veins and glands and follicles like a subtle poison, making them images of their parents and strangers to themselves. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=292))
- Her father taught his children, never doubting, that there was a single path from antiquity to eternity. Learn the psalms and ponder the ways of the early church. Know what must be known. Ancient fathers taught their ancient children, who taught their ancient children, these very things. Puritan Milton with his pagan muses. It is like a voice heard from another room, singing for the pleasure of the song, and then you know it, too, and through you it moves by accident and necessity down generations. Then, why singing? Why pleasure in it? And why the blessing of the moment when another voice is heard, dreaming to itself? ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=302))
- The young might have been restless around any primal fire where an elder was saying, Know this. Certainly they would have been restless. Their bodies were consumed with the business of lengthening limbs, sprouting hair, fitting themselves for procreation. Even so, sometimes she felt a silence in the room deeper than ordinary silence. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=308))
- What horrible, vindictive little streak of honesty had moved him to keep a record of these “debts”? She had not kept anything like an account, had never thought of such a thing, had never even felt she was giving anything away. None of it mattered now. To have been such a fool mattered. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=314))
- So while he napped, prayed, composed himself, set aside grievances and doubts, suffered the pangs of anticipation, sought footing in the general blessedness of his life for a posture of heroic and fatherly grace, and perhaps skirted dangerously near rupture of some part of the sensorium given over to grand emotion—her father’s silences were never merely silences—she walked over to Ames’s house. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=354))
- Did she choose to be there, in that house, in Gilead? No, she certainly did not. Her father needed looking after, and she had to be somewhere, like every other human being on earth. What an embarrassment that was, being somewhere because there was nowhere else for you to be. All those years of work and nothing to show for it. But you make the best of things. People respect that. It is a blessing to know what is being asked of you. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=552))
- The garden gave her a perfectly good reason not to be anywhere else, not to do anything else. And it always needed more time than she could give it. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=561))
- Waiting for the blessing, waiting for the guests to be served—always ancient men with some ecclesiastical dignity attached to them which entailed special prohibitions against childish behavior. Waiting to speak until they were spoken to, until the meal was finished, out of respect to talk of creeds and synods. Waiting even to begin until their mother lifted her fork, which she would not do until every major sign of impatience among them was suppressed. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=587))
- “But when I think what it is that brings us to our Father, it might be grief or sickness—trouble of some sort. Weariness. And then there we are, and it’s a good thing at such times to know we have a Father, whose joy it is to welcome us home. It really is. Still, humanly speaking, there is that trouble, that sorrow, and a Father has to be aware of it. He can’t help it. So there is a sadness even in great blessing, which can be a hard thing to understand.” ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=611))
- There is a saying that to understand is to forgive, but that is an error, so Papa used to say. You must forgive in order to understand. Until you forgive, you defend yourself against the possibility of understanding. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=673))
- If you forgive, he would say, you may indeed still not understand, but you will be ready to understand, and that is the posture of grace. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=677))
- For her, church was an airy white room with tall windows looking out on God’s good world, with God’s good sunlight pouring in through those windows and falling across the pulpit where her father stood, straight and strong, parsing the broken heart of humankind and praising the loving heart of Christ. That was church. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=758))
- Miracles of thrift in their grandparents’ generation had meant that the words “free and clear” could be spoken over the house and all it contained by the time it came into the young hands of their father. Those words blessed the stodginess and the shabbiness. All that big, crowding furniture and all that prim and doubtful taste commemorated heroic discipline and foresight, which could be, and must never be, undone by bringing other standards to bear than respectability and serviceability. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=792))
- As for herself, she was so conscientious that none of her A’s and A-pluses had to be accounted for otherwise than as the reward of diligence. She was good in the fullest and narrowest sense of the word as it is applied to female children. And she had blossomed into exactly the sort of adult her childhood predicted. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=835))
- Years later she had heard her father say, in the depths of his grief, “Some things are indefensible.” And it was as if he thought a great gulf had opened, Jack on the far side of it, beyond rescue or comfort. She felt she could not allow that to be true, especially since it was her father who seemed to be in hell. He had come to the last inch of his power to forgive, and there was Jack, still far beyond his reach. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=839))
- He used to live here, and he knew how things were done. It had somehow never seemed to her that the place had his attention, or it seemed he was attentive to strategies of evasion and places of concealment, never to the skills of the ordinary, dutiful choring that made up most of every life, and was so much the worth and the pride of that life, by local reckoning. But he spaded between the rows of irises and he was businesslike about it, too. He had rolled up his sleeves. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=921))
- And she could see how her father was soothed by these attentions, as if pain were an appetite for comforting of just this kind. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=970))
- Her father told his children to pray for patience, for courage, for kindness, for clarity, for trust, for gratitude. Those prayers will be answered, he said. Others may not be. The Lord knows your needs. So she prayed, Lord, give me patience. She knew that was not an honest prayer, and she did not linger over it. The right prayer would have been, Lord, my brother treats me like a hostile stranger, my father seems to have put me aside, I feel I have no place here in what I thought would be my refuge, I am miserable and bitter at heart, and old fears are rising up in me so that everything I do makes everything worse. But it cost her tears to think her situation might actually be that desolate, so she prayed again for patience, for tact, for understanding—for every virtue that might keep her safe from conflicts that would be sure to leave her wounded, every virtue that might at least help her preserve an appearance of dignity, for heaven’s sake. She did wonder what the neighbors thought, if anyone saw her in the street at that hour. Something fairly near the mark, no doubt. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1047))
- The thought had occurred to her more than once, even before the gradual catastrophe of her own venture into the world had come to an end, that “despite all” was a dangerous formula, and that the romance of absence was a distraction from more sustaining joys. Those years of her late childhood, when she felt so necessary, ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1063))
- Glory mused from time to time on how often the starchy proprieties observed in her family overlapped more or less precisely with Jack’s strategies for avoiding humiliation. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1344))
- Glory thought, That strange and particular grace a man’s body seems never to forget. Scooping up grounders and throwing sidearm. When her brothers were at home, even Jack would play baseball. That may have been why they were all so taken up with it. Even Jack could be drawn into arguments about records and statistics. He would sit around the radio with the rest of them to listen to the games. And sometimes when he played on a team he would make a beautiful catch or lay down a perfect bunt, exactly sufficient to circumstance as he never was elsewhere, and there would be a general happiness that included him, for a little while at least. She had forgotten all that. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1425))
- “Say you do something terrible. And it’s done. And you can’t change it. Then how do you live the rest of your life? What do you say about it?” “Do I know what terrible thing we’re talking about?” He nodded. “Yes. You do know. When I was out walking the other day I took a wrong turn and ended up at the cemetery.” He said, “I’d forgotten she was there.” “She was part of the family.” He nodded. “All I can tell you is what Papa would say. He’d say repent, and then—you can put it aside, more or less, and go on. You’ve probably heard him say that as often as I have.” “More often.” Then he said, “Regret doesn’t count, I suppose.” “I don’t claim to know about these things. It seems to me that regret should count. Whatever that means.” “But if you just found out about it, no matter whether I regretted or repented—what would you think of me?” “What can I say? You’re my brother. If I were someone else, and I knew you and thought you were all right, then that would matter more to me than something that happened so many years ago.” “Even though I had never told you about it. And I should have told you.” “I think so.” He nodded. “You’re not being kind.” “I don’t really know.” ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1546))
- childhood—she wondered if Lila would ever tell her what all the flowers meant, except kindness, and love of the lives, past and present, into which she had chosen to adopt herself, as if finally at home. ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1568))
- Maybe great sorrow or guilt is simply to be accepted as absolute, like revelation. My iniquity/punishment is greater than I can bear. In the Hebrew, her father said, that one word had two meanings and we chose one of them, which may make it harder for us to understand why the Lord would have pardoned Cain and protected him, and let him go on with his life, marry, have a son, build a city. His crime was his punishment, which had to mean he wasn’t such a villain after all. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1572))
- When the others were at home for the holidays, they would sit around the table in the dining room and one of them would read aloud from the Psalms or the Gospels. Like most of their obligations and many of their pleasures, this was, whatever else, a performance meant to please their father, to assure him that they loved the old life, that they had received all the good he had intended for them. To please him was so potent a motive that it displaced motives of her own, which no doubt would have included piety. During the years she lived alone she had read the Bible morning and evening with the thought that her father would be pleased if he knew, and also to remember who she was, to remember the household she came from, to induce in herself the unspecific memory of a comfort she had not really been conscious of until she left it behind. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1578))
- All bread is the bread of heaven, her father used to say. It expresses the will of God to sustain us in this flesh, in this life. Weary or bitter or bewildered as we may be, God is faithful. He lets us wander so we will know what it means to come home. ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1588))
- “It is possible to know the great truths without feeling the truth of them. That’s where the problem lies. In my case.” ([Location 1628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1628))
- As for herself, she did still pray on her knees. She also said or heard or thought a grace at every meal, even at a lunch counter or when she was with the fiancé. Train up a child in the way he should go and even when he is old he will not depart from it. The proverb was true in her case. And being at home only reinforced every habit that had been instilled in her there. Faith for her was habit and family loyalty, a reverence for the Bible which was also literary, admiration for her mother and father. And then that thrilling quiet of which she had never felt any need to speak. Her father had always said, God does not need our worship. We worship to enlarge our sense of the holy, so that we can feel and know the presence of the Lord, who is with us always. He said, Love is what it amounts to, a loftier love, and pleasure in a loving presence. She was pious, no doubt, though she would not have chosen that word to describe herself. ([Location 1720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1720))
- MAYBE SHE KEPT THE BIBLE OUT OF SIGHT BECAUSE SHE was afraid that if he spoke to her that way again she would have to tell him she had no certain notion what a soul is. She supposed it was not a mind or a self. Whatever they are. She supposed it was what the Lord saw when His regard fell upon any of us. But what can we know about that? Say we love and forgive, and enjoy the beauty of another life, however elusive it might be. Then, presumably, we have some idea of the soul we have encountered. That is what her father would say. ([Location 1727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=1727))
- Glory had noticed that men who were on uncertain terms with each other will take one step forward, leaning into a space between them as if the distance had been arrived at by treaty and could be breached only for the moment it took them to shake hands. “Jack,” he said. ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=2886))
- ‘You are patient and gracious far beyond our deserving.’” He cleared his throat. “‘You let us hope for your forgiveness when we can find no way to forgive ourselves. You bless our lives even when we have shown ourselves to be utterly ungrateful and unworthy. May we be strengthened and renewed, to make us less unworthy of blessing, through these your gifts of sustenance, of friendship and family.’” And then, “‘In Jesus’ name we pray, amen.’ ([Location 2923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=2923))
- He loved to reflect on the fact that grace was never singular in its effects, as now, when he could please his son by forgiving his friend. “That is why it is called a Spirit,” he said. “The word in Hebrew also means wind. ‘The Spirit of God brooded on the face of the deep.’ It is a sort of enveloping atmosphere.” ([Location 3449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3449))
- “I tell them there are certain attributes our faith assigns to God—omniscience, omnipotence, justice, and grace. We human beings have such a slight acquaintance with power and knowledge, so little conception of justice, and so slight a capacity for grace, that the workings of these great attributes together is a mystery we cannot hope to penetrate.” ([Location 3524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3524))
- A failed lie meant his suspicions were correct, and she had probably never lied to him successfully. In fact, lying in that family almost always meant only that the liar would appreciate discretion. So the transparency of a falsehood was very much to the point. She had cordoned off her own embarrassments from inquiry by means of a few explanations that were false on their face and never tested or returned to for that reason. As a matter of courtesy they treated one another’s deceptions like truth, which was a different thing from deceiving or being deceived. In fact, it was a great part of the fabric of mutual understanding that made their family close. ([Location 3713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3713))
- Her family was slower to forgive a failure of discretion than they were to forgive most things actually prohibited in Scripture. ([Location 3964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3964))
- Was this what they had always been afraid of, that he would really leave, that he would truly and finally put himself beyond the reach of help and harm, beyond self-consciousness and all its humiliations, beyond all that loneliness and unspent anger and all that unsalved shame, and their endless, relentless loyalty to him? ([Location 3966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3966))
- He was himself. That is what their father had always said, and by it he had meant that Jack was jostled along in the stream of their vigor and purpose and their good intentions, their habits and certitudes, and was never really a part of any of it. He had eaten their food and slept beneath their roof, wearing the clothes and speaking the dialect of their slightly self-enamored and distinctly clerical family and, for all they knew, intending no parody even when he was old enough to have been capable of it, and to have been suspected of it. ([Location 3978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=3978))
- How to announce the return of comfort and well-being except by cooking something fragrant. That is what her mother always did. After every calamity of any significance she would fill the atmosphere of the house with the smell of cinnamon rolls or brownies, or with chicken and dumplings, and it would mean, This house has a soul that loves us all, no matter what. It would mean peace if they had fought and amnesty if they had been in trouble. It had meant, You can come down to dinner now, and no one will say a thing to bother you, unless you have forgotten to wash your hands. ([Location 4039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4039))
- She might know some simple, commonplace treatment for hangover, some cool hand on the brow that would wake Jack from his sweaty sleep, as if penance were swept aside by absolution. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4049))
- Looking for you was sort of the next best thing to finding you. ([Location 4136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4136))
- Teddy said, “Somehow I got all the gray hair.” “Responsibility does that,” the old man said. “You were always the one to take responsibility. Much more than your share.” “I was always the one to worry,” Teddy said. “Yes, it comes to the same thing. I’ve worried, myself, the Good Lord knows. That took a great part of my life, I realize, looking back on it.” Jack rested his hand on the back of Glory’s chair. “Now I have to put all that aside and stop tormenting myself with the thought that I can do anything about—anything. Yes. But the Lord does work through human beings, through families.” He cleared his throat. “Part of it is giving care and another part is accepting it. That second part is difficult and very important. I know I’ve been a burden to everybody for years and years, and you have all been very good to me. And I’ve enjoyed that, even though I never enjoyed the suffering and the general uselessness that made it necessary. And I hope I have made it clear that I thank God for you, that you have been a great blessing to me. In the time he has been home, Jack has shown great kindness to me. Glory, too, of course. Yes.” He closed his eyes, and frowned with the carefulness he brought to forming his conclusion. “That’s what the family is for,” he said. “Calvin says it is the Providence of God that we look after those nearest to us. So it is the will of God that we help our brothers, and it is equally the will of God that we accept their help and receive the blessing of it. As if it came from the Lord Himself. Which it does. So I want you boys to promise me you will help each other.” ([Location 4175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4175))
- I just don’t see how I’m supposed to keep up my side of it. How I could help Teddy.” “Well, that’s what I mean about receiving help. Teddy took a world of responsibility for you, every way you’d let him do it, and it was because his happiness depended on yours. So the greatest kindness you could ever have shown him was to accept the good he intended for you. You owed him that much. And I mean spiritual help, too. Particularly spiritual help.” ([Location 4193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4193))
- I promised myself a thousand times, if you came home you would never hear a word of rebuke from me. No matter what.” “I don’t mind. I deserve rebuke.” The old man said, “You ought to let the Lord decide what you deserve. You think about that too much, what you deserve. I believe that is part of the problem.” Jack smiled. “I believe you may have a point.” “Nobody deserves anything, good or bad. It’s all grace. If you accepted that, you might be able to relax a little.” ([Location 4353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4353))
- The old man nodded. “We’re all tired now.” Then he said, “So many times, over the years, I’ve tried not to love you so much. I never got anywhere with it, but I tried. I’d say, He doesn’t care a thing about us. He needs a little money now and then, that’s the extent of it. Still, I thought you might come home for your mother’s funeral. That was a very hard time for me. It would have been a great help. Why did I think you might come home? That was foolish of me. Your mother always said, You imagine some happiness is going to come out of all this, all this waiting and hoping, but it never will. So I tried to put an end to it. But I couldn’ ([Location 4375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4375))
- “Yes, well, maybe it’s a joke, I don’t know. Last night was about as bad a night as I have passed on this earth. And I kept thinking to myself, asking the Lord, Why do I have to care so much? It seemed like a curse and an affliction to me. To love my own son. How could that be? I have wondered about it many times.” ([Location 4391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4391))
- His father said, “Kindness takes more strength than I have now. I didn’t realize how much effort I used to put into it. It’s like everything else that way, I guess.” ([Location 4406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4406))
- “All right. Dear Lord, bless these gifts to our use and us to Thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.” “Yes, I’ve always objected to that prayer. If it were only a little easier to know what they are. The needs of others. A good deal more is required than just being mindful. That has certainly been my experience.” ([Location 4502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4502))
- And here is the world, she thought, just as we left it. A hot white sky and a soft wind, a murmur among the trees, the treble rasp of a few cicadas. There were acorns in the road, some of them broken by passing cars. Chrysanthemums were coming into bloom. Yellowing squash vines swamped the vegetable gardens and tomato plants hung from their stakes, depleted with bearing. Another summer in Gilead. Gilead, dreaming out its curse of sameness, somnolence.

- That odd capacity for destitution, as if by nature we ought to have so much more than nature gives us. As if we are shockingly unclothed when we lack the complacencies of ordinary life. In destitution, even of feeling or purpose, a human being is more hauntingly human and vulnerable to kindnesses because there is the sense that things should be otherwise, and then the thought of what is wanting and what alleviation would be, and how the soul could be put at ease, restored. At home. But the soul finds its own home if it ever has a home at all. ([Location 4538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4538))
- Then Glory had seen the place as if it were the kind of memory a woman might wish for her child, and it was exactly that, the river broad and shallow, the intricacies of its bed making rivulets of the slow water, bloom on the larger little islands and butterflies everywhere. And the trees meeting high above it, shading it, making the bottom earthily apparent wherever there was calm. They all loved the river, in all generations, Jack, too. She bent and dipped her hands in the water and pressed them to her face, to conceal the embarrassment of tears, but more than that, because the river was simply manifest, a truth too seldom acknowledged. When she had been on her own, sometimes she had thought of it. ([Location 4555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4555))
- It felt like piety and propitiation to calm the disorder this most orderly man had left in the confusions of his sorrow. ([Location 4594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4594))
- He would be embarrassed that she had seen and touched his secretiveness, which was so like shame, so like affliction, that they could hardly be distinguished. She said, “I’m coming,” and stayed where she was, kneeling there, amazed at what was before her, as if it were the humblest sign of great mystery, come from a terrain where loneliness and grief are time and weather. ([Location 4596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4596))
- Then she said, “What is a soul?” He looked up, smiled, studied her face. “Why ask me?” “It just seems to me that you would know.” He shrugged. “On the basis of my vast learning and experience, I would say—it is what you can’t get rid of. Insult, deprivation, outright violence—‘If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there,’ and so on. “‘If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea.’” “Interesting choice of text.” “It came to mind. Don’t make too much of it.” ([Location 4621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4621))
- “That’s good.” He said, “Reverend Miles, Della’s father and my biographer, told me I was nothing but trouble. I felt the truth of that. I really am nothing.” He looked at her. “Nothing, with a body. I create a kind of displacement around myself as I pass through the world, which can fairly be called trouble. This is a mystery, I believe.” ([Location 4641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4641))
- A moment passed, and her father stirred from his reverie. “Kinder to him! I thanked God for him every day of his life, no matter how much grief, how much sorrow—and at the end of it all there is only more grief, more sorrow, and his life will go on that way, no help for it now. You see something beautiful in a child, and you almost live for it, you feel as though you would die for it, but it isn’t yours to keep or to protect. And if the child becomes a man who has no respect for himself, it’s just destroyed till you can hardly remember what it was—” He said, “It’s like watching a child die in your arms.” He looked at Jack. “Which I have done.” ([Location 4741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4741))
- Her father hung his head. “All of them call it home, but they never stay.” After a moment Jack said, “You don’t want me hanging around here. Reminding you of things you’d rather forget.” His voice was still barely more than a whisper. “I never forget them. Hard as I try. They’re my life.” He looked up at his son. “And so are you.” ([Location 4764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4764))
- The old man closed his eyes. “I can’t enjoy the thought of heaven like I should, leaving so much unattended to here. I know it’s wrong to think your mother’s going to ask me about it.” He was silent for a while, and then he said, “I was hoping I would be able to tell her that Jack had come home.” Jack sat pondering his father, and there was something in his face more absolute than gentleness or compassion, something purged of all the words that might describe it. Finally he said, whispered, “I hope you will give her my love.” The old man nodded. “Yes. I will certainly do that.” ([Location 4778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=4778))
- The old man raised his eyes and studied his son’s face. “You’ve never had a name for me. Not one you’d call me to my face. Why is that?” Jack shook his head. “I don’t know, myself. They all seemed wrong when I said them. I didn’t deserve to speak to you the way the others did.” “Oh!” his father said, and he closed his eyes. “That was what I waited for. That was what I wanted.” ([Location 5003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=5003))
- She spent the night listening and worrying, dreading his absence, because the thought of it made her life seem intolerably long. She thought, If I or my father or any Boughton has ever stirred the Lord’s compassion, then Jack will be all right. Because perdition for him would be perdition for every one of us. ([Location 5080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=5080))
- I used to live here, I wasn’t always gone, I was usually closer to home than he thought I was. So Jack had said, and how could he have seemed so estranged to them? And how cruel it was that he loved the place anyway. His little boy touching that tree, just to touch it. The tree that sounded like the ocean. Dear Lord in heaven, she could never change anything. How could she know what he had sanctified to that child’s mind with his stories, sad stories that had made them laugh. I used to wish I lived here, he said. That I could just walk in the door like the rest of you did. ([Location 5195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0018QSNYU&location=5195))
