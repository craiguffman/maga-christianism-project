Let us try to gain an intuitive sense of the PA account of scientific demonstration by returning to the anachronistic example mentioned in the Introduction. A car mechanic knows that when gasoline is combined with oxygen and a spark is applied combustion occurs. He knows the fact but does not know the `why,' as Aristotle puts it. When he learns a little chemistry, he discovers that octane is the combustible agent in the gasoline with which he is familiar, and he can then construct a syllogism from premises which are universal and per se. Octane would be defined by its chemical structure, and this would provide the syllogism's major premise, which would be per se in the first mode. Combustibility would be an immediate per se attribute of this chemical structure, and this would provide the minor premise. And from these premises one could draw the conclusion that octane is combustible. However, our mechanic would not yet have a scientific demonstration or scientia of the combustibility of octane, for he has not yet found the primitive cause. Octane is combustible because it has the simple hydrocarbonic structure of an alkane, which it shares with methane, ethane, propane, butane and other compounds. The combustibility of octane, then, must be demonstrated from the combustibility of alkane hydrocarbons generally. Only when one has identified the form by virtue of which an attribute is universally and exclusively per se present can one have a scientific demonstration and scientia of the inherence of that attribute in a subject.85 And such a demonstration would proceed from premises which are prior to the conclusion, which state the cause of the conclusion and which are immediate. The above discussion of the PA's complex theory of demonstration has been somewhat briefRead more at location 544
