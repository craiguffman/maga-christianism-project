# Wippel.J._CCA_04:  311

Aquinas argues that existence (esse) cannot participate in anything else in the way a substance participates in an accident or matter in form. This is so because, although both a substantial subject and matter are signified concretely, existence is signified abstractly. Nor can existence participate in anything else in the way something less extended in intelligible content participates in something more extended, for there is nothing more general than existence in which it might participate. Therefore, he concludes that existence (else) "is participated in by other things, but does not itself participate in anything else."35 At the same time, he also comments that being (ens), even though it too is most universal, is expressed concretely. Therefore, a being can participate in existence (esse) in the way something taken concretely participates in something taken abstractly.36Read more at location 1267
