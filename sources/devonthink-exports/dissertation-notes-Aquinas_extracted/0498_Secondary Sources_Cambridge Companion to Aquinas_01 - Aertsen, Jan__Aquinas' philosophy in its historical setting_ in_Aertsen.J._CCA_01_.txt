In the Prologue to his commentary on the De divinis nominibus ("On the divine names") of Pseudo-Dionysius, Aquinas provides an evaluation of Platonism. He wants to justify Dionysius's Platonic way of speaking of God as "the Good itself" and "the per se Good." He describes the Platonists as wanting to reduce every composite thing to simple, abstract principles. That is why they posit the existence of separate, ideal Forms of things. They apply this approach not only to the species of natural things but also to that which is most common, namely, good, one, and being. They hold that there is a first principle, which is the essence of goodness, of unity, and of being - a principle, Aquinas says, that we call God. Other things are called good, one, or being because of their derivation from the first principle. In the continuation of the Prologue, Aquinas rejects the first application of the Platonic method, subscribing to Aristotle's criticism that the Platonists project our abstract mode of knowing onto the mode of being of things. But with regard to the first principle itself, he recognizes the legitimacy of the Platonic approach.2- The reduction to abstract principles is justified only at the level of that which is most common, being, one, and good. These general properties are called "transcendentals" in medieval philosophy, because they transcend the Aristotelian categories. The first "separate" principle is Being itself; other things participate in being. Read more at location 321
