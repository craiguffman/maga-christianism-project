For Aquinas, within the human modus, there is a distinction between intelligence and being, and yet also an unfathomable link between them which we dimly discern according to an act of aesthetic judgement. This perspective ensures that truth does not simply reduce to our mode of apprehension of what is the case, as is bound to occur on the epistemological model for which the intellect is accorded no necessary ontological dignity, but is merely supposed to mirror a reality itself indifferent to being comprehended.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0122",

Here it will be shown how we have a certain anticipation of the beatific vision in this life because God descends in the Incarnation and its perpetuation in the Eucharist to our immediate sensory awareness, wherein alone we enjoy intuitive understanding. In this fashion, it is the lower reason which is required to educate our higher reason, although this new priority of the sensory is accompanied by a linguistic and emotional play between presence and absence. For Aquinas's Catholic position, the most abstruse intellectual reflection on truth passes into the more profound and ineffable apprehension of truth in the Eucharist. In this way, there is no gulf for him between the most elite and the most common.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0147\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Delete\u00a0this\u00a0highlight Note: This once again looks like the immediacy we see in Hooker.

For such a death is widely proclaimed by contemporary philosophers. In summary, they argue that since we only have access to the world via knowledge, it is impossible to check knowledge against the world in order to see if it corresponds with it. This is a powerful and perhaps unanswerable contention, and yet if we accept it, it seems to follow that there can be no such thing as truth at all. In what follows, however, we wish to argue that one need not accept these essentially secular conclusions. Rather, we want to suggest that a reconsideration of Aquinas can help us to meet the problems arising from the seeming insupportability of a correspondence theory of truth.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0166",

Hence, while, indeed, Aquinas thinks that the way to fulfil truth for fallen man is by imitation of the God-man (as will be discussed in Chapter Three), more generally he supposes that any truth whatsoever is a participation in the eternally uttered Logos.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0233",

    "text": "From the very outset, then, Aquinas shows us that he does not intend to refer truth to being, as if it were at a kind of static speculative epistemological remove from being. Rather, he is asking about truth as a mode of existence. This is not, however, to suggest that truth is a particular kind of being, but rather that it is convertible with Being as such in the entirety of both terms.17 Such a view is, of course, fundamental to the mediaeval tradition of Aristotelianized neoplatonic convertibility of the transcendentals which assumes that Being, which is the focal transcendental, beyond all hierarchical qualifications, is equally close to every level of the metaphysical hierarchy; equally close, that is, to genus, species, substance and accident\u2014an accident, for example, may be less self-standing than a substance, but it just as much exists as does a substance.18 So when one says that Truth is convertible with Being, one is saying that Truth is also a transcendental; that Truth, like Being, shatters the usual hierarchy of categorical priorities in such a way that the humblest creature equally shines with the one light of Truth as the most exalted, and is just as essentially disclosive of it.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0297",

Rather, there is a sort of parallel or analogy between the way things are in material or separated angelic substance and the way things are in our minds. It involves a real relation, whereby our thought occasions a teleological realization of the formality of things, and, in doing so, is itself brought to fruition. This realization of things is manifold and complicated (we will say more about this later), but for now let us note that it pertains to the way in which the thinking of things actually brings them to their telos.

A philosopher might scowl at such a usage and say that it is a sloppy metaphorical instance of the word 'true'; but for Aquinas, this would be an entirely proper use, as it would here refer to the most ideal rain, that is, rain fulfilling its operations of life, realizing its 'second act' of relations to others and to its telos, by which in exceeding itself apparently accidentally (inasmuch as it might otherwise remain in its substance just up in the clouds), it actually becomes more itself super-substantially.

    "text": " ___ Hence, while, indeed, Aquinas thinks that the way to fulfil truth for fallen man is by imitation of the God-man (as will be discussed in Chapter Three), more generally he supposes that any truth whatsoever is a participation in the eternally uttered Logos.  there is a logical way of being, a way of things existing in the mind, which for Aquinas is as real as their extramental, material existence  For Aquinas, crucially, being is analogically like knowing and knowing like being. This is what makes Aquinas's theory of truth\u2014unlike modern theories\u2014an ontological rather than epistemological one. Indeed, the conformity or proportion which pertains between knowing and the known introduces an aesthetic dimension to knowledge utterly alien to most modern considerations.13 And, in addition, truth for Aquinas has a teleological and a practical dimension, as well as a theoretical one\u2014that is to say, the truth of a thing is taken as that thing fulfilling the way it ought to be, being the way it must be in order to be true.14 These two dimensions of truth, as the way a thing is and the way it ought to be, come together, because for Aquinas they coincide in the Mind of God  From the very outset, then, Aquinas shows us that he does not intend to refer truth to being, as if it were at a kind of static speculative epistemological remove from being. Rather, he is asking about truth as a mode of existence. This is not, however, to suggest that truth is a particular kind of being, but rather that it is convertible with Being as such in the entirety of both terms  Such a view is, of course, fundamental to the mediaeval tradition of Aristotelianized neoplatonic convertibility of the transcendentals which assumes that Being, which is the focal transcendental, beyond all hierarchical qualifications, is equally close to every level of the metaphysical hierarchy; equally close, that is, to genus, species, substance and accident\u2014an accident, for example, may be less self-standing than a substance, but it just as much exists as does a substance.18 So when one says that Truth is convertible with Being, one is saying that Truth is also a transcendental; that Truth, like Being, shatters the usual hierarchy of categorical priorities in such a way that the humblest creature equally shines with the one light of Truth as the most exalted, and is just as essentially disclosive of it  Now, for Aquinas, one must refer these three Augustinian determinations of Being\u2014Being, Life and Knowledge\u2014to one another, for together they form a circle. As a being, a thing remains in itself; as living, it opens itself through the operations of life towards others; and as known or knowing it returns from others to itself  more mysteriously still, one might say that this circle traces the mediations of a further transcendental, namely, Beauty, which seems to bestow itself obliquely on each of these three stations. Beauty, because it is to do with harmony, fittingness and proportion, including that between being and knowing, is at once invisible and hyper-visible for Aquinas; it is oblique and yet omnipresent  how does Beauty mediate? First of all, insofar as Being is something which resides in itself by a kind of integrity, Beauty is apparent as the measure of that integrity;24 secondly, insofar as Beauty is involved in the manifestation of things in their integrity, without which there could be no visibility, it is fundamental to knowledge; and thirdly, insofar as Beauty is linked with desire (Beauty being defined by Thomas as that which pleases the sight), it is crucial to the outgoings or ecstases of the will and the Good. This role of Beauty, although little explicitly averred to by Aquinas, is actually essential to grasping the character of his theory of understanding.  Beauty shows Goodness through itself and the Good leads to the True,  this sense of something immanently disclosed through something else in an unmeasurable way, but in a fashion experienced as harmonious, is precisely something aesthetic. Every judgement of truth for Aquinas is an aesthetic judgement   because Truth and Being are convertible, one with another, there is a continuity between the way things are in the external material world and the way things are in our mind.  there is a sort of parallel or analogy between the way things are in material or separated angelic substance and the way things are in our minds. It involves a real relation, whereby our thought occasions a teleological realization of the formality of things, and, in doing so, is itself brought to fruition. This realization of things is manifold and complicated (we will say more about this later), but for now let us note that it pertains to the way in which the thinking of things actually brings them to their telos. This happens, because, for Aquinas, truth is less properly in things than in mind\u2014it is usually, as it were, a dormant power until it comes to be known, at which point the power of its truth is awakened  the very notion of a 'thing itself' is radically otherwise, for it is only 'itself' in its being conformed to the intellect of the knower, in its being ordered to a beautiful ratio or proportion. The thing-itself is only itself by being assimilated to the knower, and by its form entering into the mind of the knower.33 Truth is not 'tested' in any way, but sounds itself or shines outwards in beauty  So far, we have seen that, for Aquinas, truth is neither epistemological nor primarily a property of statements. We have seen more positively that it is convertible with Being, that it is a mode of existence and that it is related to a particular aspect of Being, which, according to our modus, is received as a kind of analogical or beautiful assimilation between things  For Aquinas the place of truth is manifold and hierarchical, and one finds it gradually by means of an ascending scale. One might begin by saying that truth is a property of things, that a thing is true if it fulfils itself and holds itself together according to its character and goal.  a thing is deemed 'less true' if it is impeded in some way from its ordinary operations, whether by poison or sickness.  If a thing is truest when it is teleologically directed, and that means when a thing is copying God, this would suggest, as Aquinas indeed affirms, that truth is primarily in the Mind of God and only secondarily in things as copying the Mind of God  when one knows a thing, one does not know that thing as it is by itself, but only insofar as one meaningfully grasps it as imitating God. How very odd this seems, for one would normally regard imitation as a secondary and therefore less authentic operation of life, but here it becomes the highest form of authenticity attainable for material things.37 However, the placing of imitation ahead of autonomy suggests that, for Aquinas, borrowing is the highest authenticity which can be attained.  truth as an idea expresses divine desire\u2014and this is desire for the Good, which brings into our discussion a further transcendental (besides Being and Truth). Like Truth, the Good also concerns Being in its relational aspect. But whereas Truth discloses the relations between things to the intellect\u2014all their combinations and separations\u2014the Good discloses their relations to desire (we have already seen how this disclosure is made manifest by beauty which shows us the relations between things as desirable).  truth is also a property of all finite modes of being insofar as they participate in God. These modes include both individual material substances (such as a stone, a tree, a cricket bat) and also intellectual existences (such as human and angelic minds). This means that truth is in individual material substances and intellectual existences, not in the sense that one might point to them and say that they 'are the case', as for modern theories, but because they imitate God in their appointed modes and aim for their appointed ends. And in performing their various tasks, they analogically show us something of God  We have seen, in the third place, that truth is in the human intellect. It is there in two ways: first, following Augustine, by means of divine illumination,40 and, secondly, following Aristotle, by receiving forms as species from individual material substances  It is this third aspect of truth's being in the human intellect which returns us to what we have described as the 'aesthetic moment' in Aquinas's theory of knowledge. For when the human intellect receives into itself the species of the material substances it knows, it does not know them in the manner of an arraignment of inert facts. Rather, it must always judge or discern whether they are true to themselves.41 This means that even corresponding to finite objects is really only a corresponding to the Mind of God  the mind discerns or grasps an analogical proportion of things to God, and finds here a manifestation of the invisible in the visible.   ne finds something very strange to the modern mind; for where the latter thinks of knowledge as an abasement of subjectivity before the inertly objective, Aquinas sustains, in knowing, a delicate balance between the objective and the subjective. If one requires a beautiful appearance in order to manifest the truth, then while it is indeed the objective that is registered, this registration is only made by the subjectively informed power of rightly desiring sight and judgement. There is, indeed, a certain 'what' which pleases, but this 'what' is only acknowledged as 'pleasing'. Likewise, the invisible really does shine through the visible, and yet this is only apparent for a subtle power of discernment; it is obviously not present in the manner of a 'fact'  Since the tree only transmits treeness\u2014indeed, only exists at all\u2014as imitating the divine, what we receive in truth is a participation in the divine. To put this another way, in knowing a tree, we are catching it on its way back to God.43 One could even say, given the foregoing, that for Aquinas, as he indeed affirms, knowledge is God's perpetual return to Himself. This is not a movement in the sense of a discursive passage from known to unknown, but a kind of encircling, a movement out of Himself and returning to Himself, always already completed from the beginning of eternity. For God, in knowing His own essence, also knows other things in which He sees a likeness of Himself, since He grasps Himself as participable, and so He here returns to His essence  he regards our capacity for thought not as a ruefully humiliated endeavour, but as a partial receiving of divine intellection.  we only exist humanly, that is, according to a higher kind of life, exercising our intellects, by participating in Knowledge. Thus it seems that what is extra to us most defines us; here one must observe that intellection is akin to grace, because the most important part of us is in fact not part of our animal essence at all, but is super-added to us, properly and yet accidentally  Thus he speaks of God's knowledge of all the modes in which He can be participated (in this way, God knows the creation), something of which Aristotle does not speak. God knows things fully in knowing their ends, their perfection, which includes all that they are.  Thus Aquinas, like Augustine, speaks of all knowledge as intentional, as returning to concrete things that we cannot fully grasp. This concurs with the fusion of intellect as intention with desire, which returns us to things, encouraging us to learn more of them, since to intend something is also to desire to know more of the truth of the thing\u2014this goal being regarded as a good. Thus in Aquinas, there is much more sense than with Aristotle, of knowledge as a never completed project  it turns out that we know by participation in divine knowledge; and moreover that this relation to the above is mediated by our turning to the material world below  in the foregoing, there have been several intimations that human knowledge has a self-expressive or creative dimension; not only have we seen that knowledge involves an 'aesthetic' moment whereby one must judge the beauty of a particular proportion, but also that the practice of imitation or mimesis and the exercise of imagination is not merely a passive receiving, but rather one which gathers up images and modifies them   our ideas about the essences of subordinate things proceed from ideas about the essences of higher things  When the mind understands itself, it must proceed from itself, express itself, in an intellectural word. Moreover, this emanative expression, in contrast to Aristotle, transitively proceeds, and in some ways can be seen as craft-like, as a construction or internal operation of art, insofar as the procession of the word involves a development of thought that is originally constitutive of thought, in such a way that there is no original thought without such an expressive elaboration. [This describes dialectic method]  all human knowing is to be seen as an artistic production, which again emphasizes that truth is regarded in ontological rather than epistemological terms, since it is in this way construed as an event rather than as a mirroring [THIS IS HUGE! - EVENTS MEAN HISTORY< WHICH MEANS RELATIONSHIPS ARE AESTHETIC==> TO KNOW GOD IS AN AESTHETIC EVENT]  Therefore correspondence, for Aquinas, is of what we know according to our finite modus, to God who is intrinsically far more knowable, and yet for us in His essence, utterly unknown. This means that rather than correspondence being guaranteed in its measuring of the given, as for modern notions of correspondence, it is guaranteed by its conformation to the divine source of the given. While to advance to this source is of course to advance in unknowing, it is only in terms of this unknowing, increased through faith, that we confirm even our ordinary knowing of finite things  Thus, just as for Aquinas, to correspond in knowing is to be conformed to the infinite unknown, so likewise our knowing of anything at all\u2014however local\u2014is in some measure an advance sight of the beatific vision, and union with the personal interplay of the Trinity            ",

Furthermore, this distinction is viewed as both benign and beneficial: on the one hand, it safeguards the mystery and integrity of faith; on the other hand, it allows a space for modern secular autonomy, while discouraging the growth of political theocracy and hierocratic control of knowledge. The present chapter will, however, argue that this dualistic reading of Aquinas is false. Dualism concerning reason and faith emerges not from Thomas, but rather from intellectual and practical tendencies within the late mediaeval and early modern periods (even if they were somewhat enabled already by the Gregorian reforms with their sharper divide of the lay from the clerical). Moreover, its consequence was not benign, but instead itself encouraged, with and not against early modernity, a theocratic and hierocratic authoritarianism.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0615",

Theocracy required the 'other' realm of the secular in order to have something over which to exert its sway: thus the most theocratic construals of papal authority emerged only in the later Middle Ages, as physicalist theories of the rights of a finite power legitimated by absolute power over lesser powers enjoying, intrinsically, only a limited sway. Quite shortly afterwards, similarly theocratic theories were deployed by absolute monarchs, and the resulting blend of theological voluntarism and physicalist theory of the rights of de facto power is not without echo in the later articulation of totalitarian philosophies.1Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0623",

This strengthening shifts the balance of thought slightly away from discursivity and further towards the divine-pure intuition\u2014since an increase of 'light' means an increase in the relative immediacy of understanding.15 In the case of the operation of reason, we have seen in the first chapter that Aquinas's continued Augustinian and neoplatonic construal of truth as inner illuminatio can nonetheless incorporate (as it could already in Augustine, Proclus, and Dionysius, if not Plotinus) an essential Aristotelian detour through the truth embodied in finite creatures and conveyed to us only via the senses. And while faith involves an intensification of participation in divine intellectual intuition, the same fusion of inner and outer is sustained in the knowledge accessible by faith (although it is just this fusion which is undone in later neoscholastic accounts of revelation).16 Here, also, for faith as for reason, the passive intellect marries the infallible witness of intellectual light to the infallible intuition of the senses (infallible so long as nothing contrary to the ordinary run of nature, such as a mirage, intervenes to distort their deliverances). Thus the paradigmatic scene of revelation, for Aquinas, is represented by the instance of prophecy. Here a supernatural supplement of infused cognitive light is inseparably conjoined with some extraordinary sensory vision, miraculous event, or at least novel historical occurrence.17 Since all these latter three may only, as finite instances, mediate the divine in the shape of enigma, the visions which they offer are partial and can be disclosed in their meaning\u2014and so fully seen\u2014only through acts of interpretation (beginning with the prophet himself), as essential for faith as for reason. Thus while an approach to pure vision is strengthened by faith, it still does not constitute a moment isolatable from discursive mediation.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0719",

Hence, in the present instance, metaphysics is able barely to indicate the cause of ens commune, to pronounce it 'God', and to indicate negatively the properties of inconceivable absolute and simple power and undividedness it must possess in order to be able to bring forth actuality.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0759",

Now this stress is by no means false, but it can tend to ignore the fact that, for Aquinas, in an unBarthian fashion, scripture records the event of the augmentation of human intellect through a deepened participating in the divine simplicity. Thus, for Aquinas, it is less that metaphysics is abandoned by reflection on scripture, and much more that it is fulfilled in its intention, but beyond its own understanding of this intention. It is both suspended and subsumed.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0774",

Yet (as we shall see) the 'second act' of operation is, for Aquinas, itself a superadded degree of esse that is more hyperessential than the 'original' given substance. This suggests strongly that we only grasp esse in its most intense aspect of superaddition to original substance (and essence) under the aspect of goodness (although of course the apprehensions of esse and bonum are only distinct for finite understanding).39 Nonetheless, it suggests equally that, for Aquinas, the guiding apprehension of perfection is not after all of a pre-ontological formal possibility (as it soon became for Duns Scotus) but rather is a dim and remote perception of a plenitude of infinite actuality.

In other words, there is always a Humean surplus of pure inexplicable 'succession' which is the apparently random surplus of a new event over the event which precedes it, unless a cause is more than a cause, but rather the entire gift of the effect and the emanation of the effect, which itself defines the cause as cause. (One can see how the Trinity perfects this conception.) Hence the doctrine that effects resemble their causes is not an embarrassing metaphysical residue in Aquinas, but an intrinsic part of an essentially non-metaphysical (!) transmutation of cause, since metaphysics tends to view cause as straightforwardly prior to, and independent of, its effects. As Marion indicates, a reduction of causality to efficient causality fulfils the metaphysical aspiration, and does not withdraw from it, as is usually thought. Given this understanding of causality in terms of requisition and participation, to know God as cause\u2014as supreme form, as supreme goal, as the supreme being, perfection and manifestedness of things\u2014must mean to enter more deeply into effects, in such a fashion that one starts to know more of them also in their source and origin.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a0936",

The 'first mover' emerges as the conclusion of a consideration of the subject-matter of 'moving things'. But as Aquinas's arguments for a first mover (all the five ways, taken together) show, they only work because motion is understood from the outset as being undergone with a purpose, or for a reason, and on account of a goal in accord with a nature. Therefore, if all these motions are themselves unmoved, their very motions\u2014which is to say their purposes, reasons, goals, and natures\u2014are themselves illusory.56 In knowing motions, therefore, which are all aims towards perfections (while the latter are only knowable as participations of the supreme end, the supreme good), the first mover is really radically presupposed.

In reply, however, he affirms that there is, indeed, an inchoate ordering of all human reasoning to the beatific vision, the final intellectual intuition of God.68 Thus beneath the distinction of fides and ratio along our temporal ways, lies the much more fundamental contrast between in patria and in via. According to this contrast, both faith and reason are dim anticipations of the final vision of glory. One here finds confirmed the view that, for Aquinas, since a priori reasonings to God are refused, and straightforward a posteriori inductions are equally impossible, discursive reasoning about God must presuppose a disclosure of God to our intellectus, which enjoys a very remote participation in the divine immediacy of vision. In the passage cited, Aquinas compares this remote glimpse to a first sight of 'Peter' in the distance before we know that it is, indeed, Peter who approaches. It is therefore clear that Aquinas, like Augustine before him, associates our continuous approach to the beatific vision with 'the Meno problematic', or the need already to know something before one can possibly come to know it\u2014for how else will one in the first place seek to know it at all? And the same problematic (with the added example of the child first addressing all men vaguely as 'father') is alluded to in the passage in the Commentary on Boethius's de Trinitate already discussed, where it is directly associated with the assertion that we must in some way already know the divine essence in order to affirm God's existence.69Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01055",

In the middle of part one of the Summa Theologiae, he executes the most extraordinary chiasmus. For in expounding the divine attributes, one might expect Aquinas to proceed, after his treatment of being, simplicity and perfection (goodness), quite shortly to transcendental truth and intellection. Instead, before anything has been said of divine intellect or will (approaching 'personhood'), Aquinas details God's presence to creatures, under the heading of divine substance.71 This drastically indicates that God's omnipresence simply is God himself, and that there cannot really be any being 'other' than God. Such omnipresence is seen as the direct effect of divine goodness, and elsewhere Thomas cites Dionysius's 'daring to say' that God on account of his goodness exists 'as it were outside of himself'.72 For only this impossible self-exteriorization will explain how there can be something other to God participating in God, when God is in himself the repletion of being. This impossible conjecture is the most that can be said. In part one of the Summa Theologiae, however, it is added that God is especially and uniquely present to intellect, where 'he dwells as if in his own temple'; also it is made clear that intellect simply is this more intense presence, and that this presence is only by grace.73 Thus at the heart of the chiasmic reversal\u2014Creation and humanity dealt with under divine substance\u2014grace appears for the first time, and in the midst of what some have taken to be an exercise in purely rational theology. One could interpret this to mean that, for Aquinas (and here we press perhaps beyond the nouvelle th\u00e9ologie), all creatures subsist by grace in the sense that they only subsist in their constant 'return' to full divine self-presence, while intellect simply is the consciousness of this return.74 Thus not only is the intellect grace; it is in a sense simply the site of manifestation of the creature, and so of grace.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01077",

In this account, as de Lubac pointed out (thus continuing and recommencing the real theological revolution of the twentieth century),75 Aquinas argues that reason has a natural urge to see the divine essence, since science is unsatisfied till it knows the nature of a cause. And since nature cannot be frustrated, he further argues that this urge must be capable of fulfilment.76 On the other hand, he equally affirms that such a supernatural fulfilment surpasses the capacity of human nature, in such a way that reason can only fulfil its aspiration by grace.77Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01093",

Thus to the elevation of our being into the divine substance, answers God's foreshadowing, within himself, of a proceeding beyond himself. And surely this chiasmic structure implies that Aquinas is advancing from an 'impersonal' knowledge of God as One and Good, shared with pagans like Proclus, to a more Christian apprehension of God as intentional mind and will and so as personal. Also, that while the first knowledge may be relatively a matter of rational ascent, the second is only granted through the radical descent of grace (even if Aristotle was able to anticipate fully-divine nous). Moreover, intellection as a more intense presence of God, already suggests that God must first be disclosed if he is to be desired, and thus that in us, as in God, logos must precede will (in God the Holy Spirit)\u2014while only a gracious right-willing and desiring allows us to recognize what appears as a horizon of aspiration.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01113",

Hence, a thing can be good of itself, and yet also good only by borrowing, since its very own being is the most borrowed thing of all. But, at the same time, and inversely, that which is lent by God, granted to be participated in, is primarily the gift of relative self-standing, in accord with the Dionysian idea that God's goodness is his 'standing outside of himself'.

    "text": "On the basis of the second consideration (and we can add the first and third), Michel Corbin argues that Aquinas deliberately fulfils speculation in its surpassing, as a reflection upon, and liturgical re-offering of, sacred history.148 One might support this argument by suggesting that Aquinas here follows through the Dionysian legacy of theurgic neoplatonism. For this tradition (Proclus and lamblichus), since the forms are only 'recollected' through ever-renewed reminders in time, the soul cannot be elevated above time and the body (as for Plotinus, less faithful to Plato's texts and the esoteric traditions of the academy). Therefore, in order to encounter the divine, we must rely less on theoretic ascent than on a divine descent, which nonetheless is partially enticed through certain regular ritual performances.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01607",

    "text": "Here Aquinas is exploiting to the full the Dionysian paradox of God 'existing outside of himself' which was discussed in the previous chapter. Just because there is no outside to God, God can entirely externalize himself; he can most freely and ecstatically exceed himself. Just because he cannot share anything, he can share everything. It is partially because of his intense sense of this paradox, that Aquinas espouses ontologically strong notions of human deification. Adam was created to enjoy the beatific vision, and to share, without reserve, but to the measure of human personhood, in the divine nature.11 Likewise, for Thomas (unlike some mediaeval theologians, for example Duns Scotus), Adam enjoyed already a state of semi-beatitude in Eden, receiving sanctifying grace, and possessing an impassible body.12 Significantly, Aquinas cites the predestination of Adam to deification as a further ground for the convenientia of the Incarnation: humanity has a natural kinship with the supernatural; it bears the image of God\u2014somewhat, albeit remotely, as the Son bears the image of the Father, since human beings as intelligent already possess close kinship with the divine substance (as we saw when expounding the 'chiasmus' of the Prima Pars in Chapter Two). Aquinas indeed says that, as the Word of creation, the Son has special 'kinship' with all creatures; however, this is far stronger in the creature able to articulate a word on its own account. Moreover, since man is capable of this rational articulation and yet remains material and animal, he is able to synthesize the whole work of creation, in a way the angels do not. It is 'appropriate' that this finite microcosm be conjoined with infinite plenitude, and in this way a certain 'cycle' is completed.13Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01692",

This includes his body, his physical actions, and especially his transmission of the substance of his body to the Eucharistic elements. Because, for Aquinas, all our knowledge is first in our senses, this means that we first encounter Christ in reported word and image concerning his physical manifestation, and yet more directly in our partaking of the sacraments, particularly the Eucharist.14 It is in this fashion that there is realized, for Aquinas, that aspect of convenientia, already mentioned, which is the instruction of our intellect in divine matters by our senses, to correct the turning of the intellect to sensory ends rather than divine ends after Adam. For when we imagine Christ who is perfect, our imagination is wiser than our fallen reason; when we hear of Christ, our hearing is wiser than this reason; when we taste Christ, our tongue is wiser than this reason, and only after the tasting will it once again speak reason.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01727",

This follows, because, first, the infinite truth is divine intuition; and, secondly, human knowing, which is fully preserved in its integrity in Christ's humanity, is only entirely intuitive (as opposed to a remote participation in intellectual intuition) in sensation. Thus if divine and human truth are to coincide, the 'immediacy' of the former will only be displayed in human existence (even if it also perfectly suffuses all of Christ's discursive deliberations), through Christ's sensory intuitions, and our sensory intuitions of Christ.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01743",

    "text": "Nevertheless, through this intensification, the conclusion of sacra doctrina also recasts the entire character of sacra doctrina. For hitherto, Aquinas has said (from the inception of the Prima Pars) that this teaching is a science, indeed the most scientific science, because it derives its certainty from the very fount of all certainty. Nevertheless, this certainty of science is not matched by an equal certainty of derivation, since while God reveals to us something of his absolute certainty, this is only through the approximation of appropriate analogues, whose material imagery, in particular, renders them at best remote indicators. This non-demonstrative character of our modus of knowing disqualifies theology as a strictly theoretical science. In the fourth part of the Summa Contra Gentiles, however, Aquinas (already apparently anticipating the demand of the Summa Theologiae that theology, as concerning God, should be fully scientific) had already suggested that if we know the vision of God to be our true end, we must possess 'a certain foretaste' of this by faith\u2014and that this foretaste must be 'most certain knowledge' if it is to act as 'the principle of everything ordered to the ultimate end'. In other words, to be in the truth we must orientate ourselves to absolute ontological certainty beyond our grasp, and so start with faith, and yet faith (as no longer infallibly guided since the Fall) is shaky and uncertain. To resolve this aporia and attain perfect certainty, man 'had to be instructed by God himself made man'. That is to say, for us to be able to begin to think with a kind of 'certainty', the goal of such thought had to arrive before our eyes. Aquinas cites John xi. 18: 'no man has seen God, but the only-begotten Son, he has declared him'. And for analogical reasoning to be reliable for fallen humanity, the very inappropriateness of material images had to be disclosed as, after all, in this one instance, wholly appropriate as the vehicle of truth. Aquinas therefore declares here that the materiality of the Incarnation alone renders theology a science. He repeats this point in the Tertia Pars: only the Truth incarnate founds faith.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01758",

For where Christ's integral specificity is God, and so also the universal, then it is a very strange sort of specificity which we can scarcely identify. Normally, the specific is framed by the universal; it is an item visible under the sun. But here, uniquely, the specific itself frames our vision of all other specificities: it is itself the very sun we see by. Its concreteness and particularity is therefore hyper-concrete\u2014so concrete that its reality overwhelms all else, and its very over-apparentness renders it scarcely manifest at all as a discrete item. This circumstance\u2014especially when allied to the disclosure of the Logos in the vulnerability of Christ (as will shortly be elaborated)\u2014absolutely prevents any Christological encouragement of Christian triumphalism or exclusivity. The Incarnation sacralizes no one site, with a resultant secular draining of all other sites: to the contrary, its sacral reality tends to the proliferation of sacred sites as uncontrollable by any institutional force. By contrast, where, as with Scotus, Christ is allowed some independent merely human and therefore ontic existentiality, the very 'lowness' of this Christology ensures that Christ is reduced to a locatable human idol to be possessed and manipulated by a Church thinking of itself primarily as a legally-bound institution.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01862\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Delete\u00a0this\u00a0highlight Note: This speaks to Hooker's ecumenism, and to his resistance to delimiting the church to the 'holy.'

He noted that in the case of every other sense there is always a medium between sense and the thing sensed. Thus vision requires intervening light; sound, intervening air. However, in the case of touch, there seems to be no medium, and instead touching is experienced as a registering of the immediate.30 In the case of sight, for example, the medium of light is first moved and then this medium moves us. But in the case of touch we seem to be directly moved by the source, despite the relation between different surfaces: Aristotle gives the analogy of the penetration of a body by a spear through a shield. It is not that the spear first moves the shield, and then the shield moves the body; rather the spear directly penetrates the body.31 And this appears to be the case with all instances of touch: what senses, namely the psyche, is directly affected by the corporeal.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a01937",

But he specifically mentions the power of the human tongue, which has a far more exact sense of taste than with any other animal: here one can see that Aquinas is close to the insight that cuisine is a fundamental basis of human culture, and indeed intelligence.40 By contrast, according to Aquinas, there are examples of animals being better endowed than humans in every sense other than that of touch.41Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02008",

Thus the relationship of touch to the mere utility of survival, also, for Aristotle, provides it with an existential relationship to life and death.44 This should cause us to reflect on the way in which touch, like the other senses, is also a proportio, a harmony. Aristotle explains, as we have seen, how to touch mediates proportionately between soul and touchable bodies; he also declares that it is a 'kind of mean between all tangible qualities'.45 But if touching both preserves one's own life and destroys other life (though also gives it, one might add), then we can infer that it is a kind of mean between all living things, and even a kind of mediation between the life and death of the body. We can further suggest that this standing between the life and the death of the body, is the ground, in human beings, for its standing between soul and body, and the allowing of the remove of consciousness.

All that we can assess is the touching, the resultant new relation, but this assessment is only possible because of our psychic distance from touching, which prevents a total overwhelming which would always be sensory death and oblivion.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02156",

    "text": "In the case of the other senses, it seems that we enjoy a discrete, inviolable intuition of a sensed object. But in the case of touching, we only intuit the event of encounter, and it is not the sense but the mind which intuits. Only, of course, our finite minds scarcely intuit at all, and so if the event of touching at the surface of bodies is only intuited by 'removed' mind, then in this case sensory intuition only occurs when it has already passed over into intellectual discursivity, discrimination and judgement. What is touched is only intuited as intended by active mind. Thus to the external active character of touch (which moulds as much as it is moulded), corresponds the internal active character of the psyche which, alone, is what consciously touches. So, once again, we see just why the touching hand is the supreme organ of intelligence.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02161",

    "text": "In the previous chapter it was suggested that, in Aquinas, a latent phenomenology possessed no privilege over against a primacy of active judgement and interpretation, but that, instead, his thought implied an equipoise of seeing and making. Now we can see just how radically this is confirmed by his advocacy of the Aristotelian priority of touch. For if all sensing is in a measure touching, then in all sensing we primarily touch touching and not the touched object. In seeing, what we see is as much the object looking at us, locating us, defining us, judging us, as us looking at the object. Likewise with hearing. In this way, perception is so radically inter-objective at the outset, as to forestall any later phenomenological problematic about intersubjectivity. Likewise, if all sensation is a mode of touch, things can only be intuited by mind, which is really to be intuited as always already intended, discussed, discriminated and judged conjecturally in relation to an unlimited horizon.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02168",

However, if touch is more integrally related to human intelligence, and touch reveals the essential character of all sensory intuition, then it would seem that divine intuition must, eminently, be 'touch'. And then, whereas in the previous chapter we spoke of the divine understanding as the coincidence of 'seeing' with 'making', now we can see that to describe this understanding as intuitive 'touching' would encompass both aspects.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02181",

If 'touch' seems to hold the balance between mind and body, then sacramental touching anno domini seems to shift the balance towards body. But how can there be revision even of finite ontological order? For it reflects an order that eternally pertains between finite and infinite; and part of this order (at least we assume) is the priority of mind over body. However, if intellect knows through touching, and the ratio of mind to body consists in the medium of touch, then we have seen that touch, more than other sensing, is an interactive event (and not a passive registering). Hence the priority of touch discloses the relation of mind and body to have the character of event, and events are revisable. Here ontology itself expects self-revision.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02198",

As a 'proper accident', this hand is involved in the event and events of touching which are contingent, and yet fully belong to the person who touches.

The disciple Thomas, as the angelic doctor Thomas recalls, was permitted to ease his doubt by touching the wounds of the resurrected Christ,53 and we are permitted to encounter God through the most intimate and discerning touch of all, which is that of the tongue in taste. For Aquinas, as for Augustine, the Eucharist most of all accomplishes a reversal. Normally food and drink are to nourish the body, which is to sustain the mind. But here the mind is not only to attend to what it eats and drinks, which can alone instruct it in the truth; it is even\u2014after Augustine\u2014to become this food and drink, which makes present the truth incarnate. Ordinarily, food and drink become us; here we are to become this food and drink. And in this case, at last, the exclusiveness of touch which permitted its penetration, is conjoined with that generality and commonality hitherto peculiar to sight and hearing. For when we touch the body and blood of Christ, we touch everything, and infinite others may touch all the same points of this body at the same time.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02217",

Therefore, one must assume that the ontological revision of the finite which establishes the hypostatic union, since it establishes thereby a higher finite reality, discloses something new about God, hitherto unknown to us. Likewise, since the hypostatic union entails the further ontological revision which is the exalting of the sensory and further exhibition of the priority of touch (in such a way that one can, for Aquinas, even say of the finite human nature in Christ, by virtue of the one esse, that 'it creates'), we must assume that this exalting and exhibition also discloses something new about God.

However, this instrumentalist view of the sacraments suffers the same objection as an instrumentalist view of the Incarnation. In the latter case, for Aquinas, Christ became incarnate to redeem us, but this incarnation is a reality which eternally persists beyond our redemption, and in ontological dignity exceeds it. Likewise, if the body of the Incarnate God resides in bread and wine in order to feed us spiritually, this residing is eternally true\u2014since bread and wine are not accidents of God, as nothing can be, and therefore they also are events which can never depart from him. Again, this residing exceeds in ontological dignity its occasion, and reserving of the Eucharistic elements, or the Corpus Christi processions which Aquinas helped to promote, appropriately express this. (One should note here also that we can be redeemed only by what is more than necessary for our redemption: that is, God and his presence.) So just as 'Our Lady is now Heaven's Queen', so also the humanly sensory is forever exalted in its inexhaustible depth above the human intelligence (although for the human intelligence). In consequence, since all that comes to pass participates in God whose truth it displays, and never expresses any arbitrary whim, this exaltation, like the hypostatic union, must disclose some hitherto unexpected dimension of the divine truth.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02240",

But for Aquinas's theological metaphysics, this existential character of the Logos is the real, is the true concrete reality which upholds everything. Hence to be conjoined this way, is not to be weakly or metaphorically conjoined, nor merely conjoined by similar habitus (a position he specifically rejects), but also to be joined in substantive actuality.

    "text": "And especially in becoming the subject of a human death, is God disclosed as touch. Since, as we have seen, for Aristotle and Aquinas, human intelligence is only inviolate as linked to absolutely vulnerable touch, it was appropriate that the Logos was only disclosed in time in and as a vulnerable body. And it was appropriate also that in dying (inevitably, because of sin), the exposure of the incarnate Logos to the touch of all should be revealed as the abiding intelligence able to resurrect the wounded surface of touch also to inviolable life.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02308",

    "text": "It is these touching wounds, which, like the disciple Thomas, we touch, in order to touch for the first time God whose truth is to touch (meaning both to mould and to encounter). And since God is now revealed as touch, the new ontological exaltation of the sensory over the intellectual is no mere pedagogic means, but an appropriate new disclosure of the ultimately real. This exaltation, as we have seen, is undergirded by the priority of touch, whose direct mediation of the psychic ensures that this exaltation by no means betrays the understanding. It could always have been seen that touch as finely attuned sensation brought about understanding, but this is much more emphatically manifest after the Incarnation. Now, in order to understanding anything of divine truth (and so truth per se), we must touch divine physical manifestations, and we must elicit these through our Grafting of liturgical enactments.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02312",

    "text": "When the supremely indeterminate pronoun 'this' is used to display, say, a diamond, the mind does not settle on conceiving it as a present apparent thing, but adds to it the ideas of a hard and sparkling body having a certain shape, besides connotations of wealth, beauty, romance and rarity.2 This qualification of our certainty regarding the meaning of words forms the basis of Arnauld's and Nicole's attack on the Calvinists' metaphorical interpretation of the Eucharist. For the Calvinists, they argue, assume in full nominalist fashion (probably influenced by the French Calvinist humanist Petrus Ramus), that the word 'this' establishes a firm attachment to a determinate referent, namely, in the case of Jesus's assertion, 'this is my body', a firm attachment to the bread. If one detaches the demonstrative pronoun from its obvious referent, as is the case, the Calvinists claim, when Jesus says 'this is my body', then it must be intended metaphorically. Arnauld and Nicole argue against this by drawing attention to the Calvinists' error of assuming that the demonstrative pronoun 'this' is anchored to a determinate specificity. To the contrary, they argue, specific application is only made possible in this case, because of the term's maximum of indeterminacy, its unlimited transferability. For the word 'this' always remains susceptible of further determinations and of being linked to other ideas.3Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02333",

    "text": "In addition, even when something apparently determinate is invoked by the pronoun 'this', that specificity is itself infinitely divisible and in consequence retains an open-ended and mysterious character. One might think, in the case of the bread to which the pronoun 'this' refers in Jesus's assertion, that there is at least some limit to the open-endedness of our mental compassing of the bread. But later in the Logic, again invoking Pascal, Arnauld and Nicole protest that even 'the smallest grain of wheat contains in itself a tiny world with all its parts\u2014a sun, heavens, stars, planets, and an earth\u2014with admirably precise proportions; that there are no parts of this grain that do not contain yet another proportional world'.4 Thus, even the most literal-seeming reference in fact preserves an infinity of mystery, even as it seems to command or delimit that extension.5Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02343",

    "text": "Pascal and his allies deployed aspects of the New Science against nominalism and the cruder variants of empiricism. And they brought into apologetic alignment the scene of experimentation with the scene of sacrificial offering, to the extent that both are read as exposing and releasing unexpected depths within seemingly brute matter. For the Port-Royal grammarians, therefore, there is a triple bond between the theory of physical matter, the question of how language operates and the theology of the Eucharist, and in particular the doctrine of transubstantiation. Echoing this threefold concern we will now demonstrate how discernment of the Body and Blood of Christ in the material species of bread and wine in the Eucharist, as interpreted by Aquinas, allows for\u2014even demands\u2014the greatest inexhaustibility of meaning, but at the same time, overcomes the problem of a sheer indeterminacy of sense, thereby allowing a basis for the possibility of 'truth'.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02353",

Thus a more positive account of the sign is suggested, for the sign here is neither emptily 'left behind' through postponement, nor is it the instrumental Ramist sign which secures the real in an artificial exactitude.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02431",

If this coincidence becomes fissured, the Eucharistic signs perforce become either a matter of non-essential, illustrative signification which relies upon a non-participatory and conventional (if mimetic) similitude between the bread and the Body, and the wine and the Blood, or else the site of an extrinsicist miracle which stresses the alienness of bread from Body, and wine from Blood. These alternatives, in disconnecting the symbolic from the real, in an attempt to prioritize either one or the other, are both equally reducible to a synchronic mode of presence which fails to allow the sacramental mystery its full, temporally ecstatic potential within the action of ecclesia, namely, the continuing coming-to-be of the Church as Christ's body through an ingesting of this same body, which is at once a real and a symbolic consuming.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02436",

    "text": "For in a fallen world, we do not infallibly experience the unknown depth as a participated unknown which partially discloses its truth in the manifest; to the contrary, we experience it also as a rupture from God and ultimate truth or meaningfulness. Such hesitation is only overcome when we encounter, with the eyes of faith, the divine bridging of this rupture so that (here in the Eucharist) we see and taste a material surface as immediately conjoined to the infinite depth. Participation is, in this case, so entire that God as the participated truth is fully present, without lack, in the material bread and wine which participate. The situation heire is exactly parallel to that which was disclosed in Chapter Three in relation to the Incarnation. Because human reason no longer discerned God through its material sensing of the material world, God had to descend bodily into this world to reinstruct our reason. However, were it the case (as for some Protestant views), that the Incarnation is in no sense perpetuated through time, then, after Christ's ascension, one would revert to a priority of our rational remembering and understanding of Christ both for our salvation and our access to truth. Yet this appears unsatisfactory: first of all, because our fallenness persists and is still to be fully healed; secondly, because\u2014as was explained in Chapter Three\u2014the new priority of the sensory (especially of touch) amounts to an ontological revision whose 'fittingness' for our redemption nonetheless (beyond its mere means) discloses something new about God. Since God is not, for Aquinas, an arbitrary God, the 'convenient' means he newly elects, also further disclose how he eternally is.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02481",
