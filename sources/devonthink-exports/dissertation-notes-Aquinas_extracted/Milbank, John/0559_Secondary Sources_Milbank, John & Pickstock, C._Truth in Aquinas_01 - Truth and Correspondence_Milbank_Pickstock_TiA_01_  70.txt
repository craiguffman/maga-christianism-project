For, indeed, because Truth and Being are convertible, one with another, there is a continuity between the way things are in the external material world and the way things are in our mind.

Rather, there is a sort of parallel or analogy between the way things are in material or separated angelic substance and the way things are in our minds. It involves a real relation, whereby our thought occasions a teleological realization of the formality of things, and, in doing so, is itself brought to fruition. This realization of things is manifold and complicated (we will say more about this later), but for now let us note that it pertains to the way in which the thinking of things actually brings them to their telos.
