However, in his early Commentary on Boethins's de Hebdomadibus, Aquinas, after Boethius, faced a dilemma: if created substances are only good as receiving good from God, that is, by participation, then how can they be said to be good at all, good in themselves, good in their substance?93 Solving this dilemma in part motivates Aquinas's switch of emphasis from bonum to esse: for he argues that it is subsistent existence, as a participant in esse, that is itself the most fundamentally participatory thing. Hence, a thing can be good of itself, and yet also good only by borrowing, since its very own being is the most borrowed thing of all. But, at the same time, and inversely, that which is lent by God, granted to be participated in, is primarily the gift of relative self-standing, in accord with the Dionysian idea that God's goodness is his 'standing outside of himself'. Both these notions reconstrue participation as grace and kenosis, but they do not add grace and kenosis to participation.Read more at location 1183
