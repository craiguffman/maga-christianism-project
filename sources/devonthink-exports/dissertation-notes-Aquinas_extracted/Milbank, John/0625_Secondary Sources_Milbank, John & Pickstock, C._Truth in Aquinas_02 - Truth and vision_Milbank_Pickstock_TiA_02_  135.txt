In the first question of the Summa Theologiae, Aquinas asks why, if God can be naturally known, he has to be discursively inferred, and is not immediately apparent. In reply, however, he affirms that there is, indeed, an inchoate ordering of all human reasoning to the beatific vision, the final intellectual intuition of God.68 Thus beneath the distinction of fides and ratio along our temporal ways, lies the much more fundamental contrast between in patria and in via. According to this contrast, both faith and reason are dim anticipations of the final vision of glory. One here finds confirmed the view that, for Aquinas, since a priori reasonings to God are refused, and straightforward a posteriori inductions are equally impossible, discursive reasoning about God must presuppose a disclosure of God to our intellectus, which enjoys a very remote participation in the divine immediacy of vision. In the passage cited, Aquinas compares this remote glimpse to a first sight of 'Peter' in the distance before we know that it is, indeed, Peter who approaches. It is therefore clear that Aquinas, like Augustine before him, associates our continuous approach to the beatific vision with 'the Meno problematic', or the need already to know something before one can possibly come to know it—for how else will one in the first place seek to know it at all? And the same problematic (with the added example of the child first addressing all men vaguely as 'father') is alluded to in the passage in the Commentary on Boethius's de Trinitate already discussed, where it is directly associated with the assertion that we must in some way already know the divine essence in order to affirm God's existence.69Read more at location 1055
