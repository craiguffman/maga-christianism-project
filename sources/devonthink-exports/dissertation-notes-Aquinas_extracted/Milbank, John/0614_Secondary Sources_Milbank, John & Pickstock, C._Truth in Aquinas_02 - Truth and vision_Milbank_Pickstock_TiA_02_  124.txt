While, for Aquinas, in terms of substance, a thing primarily is said 'to be', and secondarily is said 'to be good' (since mere existence is also good), in terms of its operation it is primarily regarded as 'good' (since operation involves teleology) and secondarily as 'existing'. Yet (as we shall see) the 'second act' of operation is, for Aquinas, itself a superadded degree of esse that is more hyperessential than the 'original' given substance. This suggests strongly that we only grasp esse in its most intense aspect of superaddition to original substance (and essence) under the aspect of goodness (although of course the apprehensions of esse and bonum are only distinct for finite understanding).39 Nonetheless, it suggests equally that, for Aquinas, the guiding apprehension of perfection is not after all of a pre-ontological formal possibility (as it soon became for Duns Scotus) but rather is a dim and remote perception of a plenitude of infinite actuality. The insistence of the ideal is, after all, as much ontological as pre-ontological.Read more at location 869
