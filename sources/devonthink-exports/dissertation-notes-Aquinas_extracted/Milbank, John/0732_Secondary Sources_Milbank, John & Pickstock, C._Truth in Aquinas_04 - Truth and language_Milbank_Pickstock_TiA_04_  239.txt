For in a fallen world, we do not infallibly experience the unknown depth as a participated unknown which partially discloses its truth in the manifest; to the contrary, we experience it also as a rupture from God and ultimate truth or meaningfulness. Such hesitation is only overcome when we encounter, with the eyes of faith, the divine bridging of this rupture so that (here in the Eucharist) we see and taste a material surface as immediately conjoined to the infinite depth. Participation is, in this case, so entire that God as the participated truth is fully present, without lack, in the material bread and wine which participate. The situation heire is exactly parallel to that which was disclosed in Chapter Three in relation to the Incarnation. Because human reason no longer discerned God through its material sensing of the material world, God had to descend bodily into this world to reinstruct our reason. However, were it the case (as for some Protestant views), that the Incarnation is in no sense perpetuated through time, then, after Christ's ascension, one would revert to a priority of our rational remembering and understanding of Christ both for our salvation and our access to truth. Yet this appears unsatisfactory: first of all, because our fallenness persists and is still to be fully healed; secondly, because—as was explained in Chapter Three—the new priority of the sensory (especially of touch) amounts to an ontological revision whose 'fittingness' for our redemption nonetheless (beyond its mere means) discloses something new about God. Since God is not, for Aquinas, an arbitrary God, the 'convenient' means he newly elects, also further disclose how he eternally is.Read more at location 2481
