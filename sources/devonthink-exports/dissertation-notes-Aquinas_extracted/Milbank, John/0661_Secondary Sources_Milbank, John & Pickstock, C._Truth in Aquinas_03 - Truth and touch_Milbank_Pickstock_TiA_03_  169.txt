Here Aquinas is exploiting to the full the Dionysian paradox of God 'existing outside of himself' which was discussed in the previous chapter. Just because there is no outside to God, God can entirely externalize himself; he can most freely and ecstatically exceed himself. Just because he cannot share anything, he can share everything. It is partially because of his intense sense of this paradox, that Aquinas espouses ontologically strong notions of human deification. Adam was created to enjoy the beatific vision, and to share, without reserve, but to the measure of human personhood, in the divine nature.11 Likewise, for Thomas (unlike some mediaeval theologians, for example Duns Scotus), Adam enjoyed already a state of semi-beatitude in Eden, receiving sanctifying grace, and possessing an impassible body.12 Significantly, Aquinas cites the predestination of Adam to deification as a further ground for the convenientia of the Incarnation: humanity has a natural kinship with the supernatural; it bears the image of God—somewhat, albeit remotely, as the Son bears the image of the Father, since human beings as intelligent already possess close kinship with the divine substance (as we saw when expounding the 'chiasmus' of the Prima Pars in Chapter Two). Aquinas indeed says that, as the Word of creation, the Son has special 'kinship' with all creatures; however, this is far stronger in the creature able to articulate a word on its own account. Moreover, since man is capable of this rational articulation and yet remains material and animal, he is able to synthesize the whole work of creation, in a way the angels do not. It is 'appropriate' that this finite microcosm be conjoined with infinite plenitude, and in this way a certain 'cycle' is completed.13Read more at location 1692
