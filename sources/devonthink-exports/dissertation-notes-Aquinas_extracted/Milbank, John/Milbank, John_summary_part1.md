The second consequence follows because if the only measure of the truth of a practice is it's success, then anything that works is regarded as just as good as anything else, so long as it works also, without regard for any judgement as to the inherent desirability of what has been constructed. In this fashion, truth becomes detached from the good.Read more at location 92

Ironically, for these texts, practices and traditions to acquire absolute authority outside the workings of human reason, they have to be regarded positivistically, in a fashion which mimics scientific positivism itself. The irrational strangely colludes with the most vigorously reduced rationalism, and often one finds that various fundamentalisms and fideisms are able happily to coexist with, and even to reinforce, the technoscientific capitalism of our day.Read more at location 111

However, we seek to show that in Aquinas, correspondence indicates a real ontological proportion between being and intelligence in a perspective where these are regarded as transcendentally convertible. For Aquinas, within the human modus, there is a distinction between intelligence and being, and yet also an unfathomable link between them which we dimly discern according to an act of aesthetic judgement. This perspective ensures that truth does not simply reduce to our mode of apprehension of what is the case, as is bound to occur on the epistemological model for which the intellect is accorded no necessary ontological dignity, but is merely supposed to mirror a reality itself indifferent to being comprehended.Read more at location 122

We will argue that, contrary to usual readings, reason and faith in Aquinas represent only different degrees of intensity of participation in the divine light of illumination and different measures of absolute vision. And, furthermore, that reason itself requires faith because it already presupposes the operation of grace, while, inversely, faith still demands discursive argumentation and is only higher than reason because it enjoys a deeper participation in the divine reason which is direct intuition or pure intellectual vision.Read more at location 130

neither, on the other hand, does he offer support to those who demand a confinement to Biblical revelation independent of the Greek legacy of metaphysical reflection. Rather, it will be shown that, for Aquinas, revealed theology supplements metaphysics with history and requires a completion of the theoretical ascent to truth with a meeting of the divine descent in liturgical practice.Read more at location 134

The commencement of this descent is at the Incarnation. In the third chapter, it will be shown not only how, for Aquinas, truth is only restored for fallen men by the hypostatic union, but also how this restoration involves certain ontological revisions in excess of their occasion: namely the conjoining of an ontic event with esse ipsum and a kenotic elevation of the sensory over the intellectual, and more specifically the sensory as touch. In Christ, this new sensorial access to truth is something one both contemplates and reproduces through the enactment of the sacraments.Read more at location 138

This double relation to Christ corresponds to the way in which, for Aquinas, truth in God is both something envisaged and something actively performed by the Father in the Logos. Because we participate in this truth, for us also it is something that we see as a reflection of the invisible in the visible, and, at same time, something that we construct, as it were unwittingly, through our artistic and liturgical attempts to praise the divine. Seeing and making are combined in the mutuality of touch which is most intensely taste; and the Eucharist, as foretaste of our beatitude, newly discloses to us that this supreme intuition is itself also a 'touching'.Read more at location 142

In the fourth chapter, the nature of this liturgical completion of truth is elaborated. Here it will be shown how we have a certain anticipation of the beatific vision in this life because God descends in the Incarnation and its perpetuation in the Eucharist to our immediate sensory awareness, wherein alone we enjoy intuitive understanding. In this fashion, it is the lower reason which is required to educate our higher reason, although this new priority of the sensory is accompanied by a linguistic and emotional play between presence and absence. For Aquinas's Catholic position, the most abstruse intellectual reflection on truth passes into the more profound and ineffable apprehension of truth in the Eucharist. In this way, there is no gulf for him between the most elite and the most common.Read more at location 147   • Delete this highlight Note: This once again looks like the immediacy we see in Hooker.

How should one respond to the death of realism, the death of the idea that thoughts in our minds can represent to us the way things actually are in the world? For such a death is widely proclaimed by contemporary philosophers. In summary, they argue that since we only have access to the world via knowledge, it is impossible to check knowledge against the world in order to see if it corresponds with it. This is a powerful and perhaps unanswerable contention, and yet if we accept it, it seems to follow that there can be no such thing as truth at all. In what follows, however, we wish to argue that one need not accept these essentially secular conclusions. Rather, we want to suggest that a reconsideration of Aquinas can help us to meet the problems arising from the seeming insupportability of a correspondence theory of truth.Read more at location 166

As we shall see, if Marshall had espoused more wholeheartedly Aquinas's concept of truth, there would be no need for him to promote a dualism between the secular realm, where the redundancy of truth can reign unchallenged, and the theological realm, where correspondence is possible through Christ.7 For it will be shown that Aquinas's fundamental theory of truth is as theological as it is philosophical, and is only a correspondence theory in a sense which depends entirely upon the metaphysical notion of participation in the divine Being. Hence, while, indeed, Aquinas thinks that the way to fulfil truth for fallen man is by imitation of the God-man (as will be discussed in Chapter Three), more generally he supposes that any truth whatsoever is a participation in the eternally uttered Logos.Read more at location 233

for Aquinas, grammar is grounded in ontology, because the criterion for making sense, or deciding which word can be conjoined with which other words and in what way, is what belongs together or could belong together in ontological reality, either in things outside the mind, or in the mind's mode of understanding those things.10 In the latter case, this criterion is logical as well as ontological only in the very 'unmodern' sense that there is a logical way of being, a way of things existing in the mind, which for Aquinas is as real as their extramental, material existence.Read more at location 252

For Aquinas, crucially, being is analogically like knowing and knowing like being. This is what makes Aquinas's theory of truth—unlike modern theories—an ontological rather than epistemological one. Indeed, the conformity or proportion which pertains between knowing and the known introduces an aesthetic dimension to knowledge utterly alien to most modern considerations.13 And, in addition, truth for Aquinas has a teleological and a practical dimension, as well as a theoretical one—that is to say, the truth of a thing is taken as that thing fulfilling the way it ought to be, being the way it must be in order to be true.14 These two dimensions of truth, as the way a thing is and the way it ought to be, come together, because for Aquinas they coincide in the Mind of God.Read more at location 277

From the very outset, then, Aquinas shows us that he does not intend to refer truth to being, as if it were at a kind of static speculative epistemological remove from being. Rather, he is asking about truth as a mode of existence. This is not, however, to suggest that truth is a particular kind of being, but rather that it is convertible with Being as such in the entirety of both terms.17 Such a view is, of course, fundamental to the mediaeval tradition of Aristotelianized neoplatonic convertibility of the transcendentals which assumes that Being, which is the focal transcendental, beyond all hierarchical qualifications, is equally close to every level of the metaphysical hierarchy; equally close, that is, to genus, species, substance and accident—an accident, for example, may be less self-standing than a substance, but it just as much exists as does a substance.18 So when one says that Truth is convertible with Being, one is saying that Truth is also a transcendental; that Truth, like Being, shatters the usual hierarchy of categorical priorities in such a way that the humblest creature equally shines with the one light of Truth as the most exalted, and is just as essentially disclosive of it.Read more at location 297

Now, for Aquinas, one must refer these three Augustinian determinations of Being—Being, Life and Knowledge—to one another, for together they form a circle. As a being, a thing remains in itself; as living, it opens itself through the operations of life towards others; and as known or knowing it returns from others to itself.23Read more at location 322

In these three stages or aspects of our modus, we see the interpenetrations of Being and Truth. But, more mysteriously still, one might say that this circle traces the mediations of a further transcendental, namely, Beauty, which seems to bestow itself obliquely on each of these three stations. Beauty, because it is to do with harmony, fittingness and proportion, including that between being and knowing, is at once invisible and hyper-visible for Aquinas; it is oblique and yet omnipresent.Read more at location 325

Path: Secondary Sources/Milbank, John & Pickstock, C./Truth in Aquinas/01 - Truth and Correspondence/Milbank_Pickstock_TiA_01:  68

how does Beauty mediate? First of all, insofar as Being is something which resides in itself by a kind of integrity, Beauty is apparent as the measure of that integrity;24 secondly, insofar as Beauty is involved in the manifestation of things in their integrity, without which there could be no visibility, it is fundamental to knowledge; and thirdly, insofar as Beauty is linked with desire (Beauty being defined by Thomas as that which pleases the sight), it is crucial to the outgoings or ecstases of the will and the Good. This role of Beauty, although little explicitly averred to by Aquinas, is actually essential to grasping the character of his theory of understanding.Read more at location 328

Thus Beauty shows Goodness through itself and the Good leads to the True, yet we could never look at these relations as at a measurable distance. And this sense of something immanently disclosed through something else in an unmeasurable way, but in a fashion experienced as harmonious, is precisely something aesthetic. Every judgement of truth for Aquinas is an aesthetic judgement.Read more at location 336

For, indeed, because Truth and Being are convertible, one with another, there is a continuity between the way things are in the external material world and the way things are in our mind. But this 'continuity' is not to be taken lightly. It is not for Aquinas a continuity in the sense of a mirroring or reflecting, of our thoughts simply being 'true to the facts'. Rather, there is a sort of parallel or analogy between the way things are in material or separated angelic substance and the way things are in our minds. It involves a real relation, whereby our thought occasions a teleological realization of the formality of things, and, in doing so, is itself brought to fruition. This realization of things is manifold and complicated (we will say more about this later), but for now let us note that it pertains to the way in which the thinking of things actually brings them to their telos. This happens, because, for Aquinas, truth is less properly in things than in mind—it is usually, as it were, a dormant power until it comes to be known, at which point the power of its truth is awakened.27Read more at location 346

Indeed, the very notion of a 'thing itself' is radically otherwise, for it is only 'itself' in its being conformed to the intellect of the knower, in its being ordered to a beautiful ratio or proportion. The thing-itself is only itself by being assimilated to the knower, and by its form entering into the mind of the knower.33 Truth is not 'tested' in any way, but sounds itself or shines outwards in beauty.Read more at location 368

So far, we have seen that, for Aquinas, truth is neither epistemological nor primarily a property of statements. We have seen more positively that it is convertible with Being, that it is a mode of existence and that it is related to a particular aspect of Being, which, according to our modus, is received as a kind of analogical or beautiful assimilation between things.Read more at location 372

Where, indeed, are we to find truth? For Aquinas the place of truth is manifold and hierarchical, and one finds it gradually by means of an ascending scale. One might begin by saying that truth is a property of things, that a thing is true if it fulfils itself and holds itself together according to its character and goal.34 Thus, one can say 'This is true rain' if it is raining very hard. A philosopher might scowl at such a usage and say that it is a sloppy metaphorical instance of the word 'true'; but for Aquinas, this would be an entirely proper use, as it would here refer to the most ideal rain, that is, rain fulfilling its operations of life, realizing its 'second act' of relations to others and to its telos, by which in exceeding itself apparently accidentally (inasmuch as it might otherwise remain in its substance just up in the clouds), it actually becomes more itself super-substantially. Indeed, a thing is deemed 'less true' if it is impeded in some way from its ordinary operations, whether by poison or sickness.35Read more at location 376

If a thing is truest when it is teleologically directed, and that means when a thing is copying God, this would suggest, as Aquinas indeed affirms, that truth is primarily in the Mind of God and only secondarily in things as copying the Mind of God.Read more at location 386

when one knows a thing, one does not know that thing as it is by itself, but only insofar as one meaningfully grasps it as imitating God. How very odd this seems, for one would normally regard imitation as a secondary and therefore less authentic operation of life, but here it becomes the highest form of authenticity attainable for material things.37 However, the placing of imitation ahead of autonomy suggests that, for Aquinas, borrowing is the highest authenticity which can be attained.Read more at location 391

truth as an idea expresses divine desire—and this is desire for the Good, which brings into our discussion a further transcendental (besides Being and Truth). Like Truth, the Good also concerns Being in its relational aspect. But whereas Truth discloses the relations between things to the intellect—all their combinations and separations—the Good discloses their relations to desire (we have already seen how this disclosure is made manifest by beauty which shows us the relations between things as desirable). Such a suggestion that desire is disclosive of the real, that desire just as much as knowledge corresponds to Being, suggests an additional way in which Thomist adequatio differs from modern correspondence theories, since these would be unable to encompass, and indeed would regard as outlandish, any notion that we register the way things are in terms of the way they ought to be.Read more at location 401

we have seen that truth is also a property of all finite modes of being insofar as they participate in God. These modes include both individual material substances (such as a stone, a tree, a cricket bat) and also intellectual existences (such as human and angelic minds). This means that truth is in individual material substances and intellectual existences, not in the sense that one might point to them and say that they 'are the case', as for modern theories, but because they imitate God in their appointed modes and aim for their appointed ends. And in performing their various tasks, they analogically show us something of God.Read more at location 413

We have seen, in the third place, that truth is in the human intellect. It is there in two ways: first, following Augustine, by means of divine illumination,40 and, secondly, following Aristotle, by receiving forms as species from individual material substances.Read more at location 418

It is this third aspect of truth's being in the human intellect which returns us to what we have described as the 'aesthetic moment' in Aquinas's theory of knowledge. For when the human intellect receives into itself the species of the material substances it knows, it does not know them in the manner of an arraignment of inert facts. Rather, it must always judge or discern whether they are true to themselves.41 This means that even corresponding to finite objects is really only a corresponding to the Mind of God.Read more at location 422

the mind discerns or grasps an analogical proportion of things to God, and finds here a manifestation of the invisible in the visible. Thus, what it finds here is beauty which 'pleases' the sight, and delights the judgement.42 Here again, as with the ethical dimension of truth, one finds something very strange to the modern mind; for where the latter thinks of knowledge as an abasement of subjectivity before the inertly objective, Aquinas sustains, in knowing, a delicate balance between the objective and the subjective. If one requires a beautiful appearance in order to manifest the truth, then while it is indeed the objective that is registered, this registration is only made by the subjectively informed power of rightly desiring sight and judgement. There is, indeed, a certain 'what' which pleases, but this 'what' is only acknowledged as 'pleasing'. Likewise, the invisible really does shine through the visible, and yet this is only apparent for a subtle power of discernment; it is obviously not present in the manner of a 'fact'.Read more at location 427

Since the tree only transmits treeness—indeed, only exists at all—as imitating the divine, what we receive in truth is a participation in the divine. To put this another way, in knowing a tree, we are catching it on its way back to God.43 One could even say, given the foregoing, that for Aquinas, as he indeed affirms, knowledge is God's perpetual return to Himself. This is not a movement in the sense of a discursive passage from known to unknown, but a kind of encircling, a movement out of Himself and returning to Himself, always already completed from the beginning of eternity. For God, in knowing His own essence, also knows other things in which He sees a likeness of Himself, since He grasps Himself as participable, and so He here returns to His essence.44Read more at location 437

To say that things are only really true in God would suggest that Aquinas is in this instance modifying Aristotle in the direction of Augustine and neoplatonism. However, Aquinas combines Aristotle with neoplatonism in an entirely new way. Following Aristotle, he sees even the human soul as fundamentally an animal soul, or a 'form of forms' which holds together a living material organism. He regards intellect as merely a power of the soul, rather than its essence.45Read more at location 444

we only exist humanly, that is, according to a higher kind of life, exercising our intellects, by participating in Knowledge. Thus it seems that what is extra to us most defines us; here one must observe that intellection is akin to grace, because the most important part of us is in fact not part of our animal essence at all, but is super-added to us, properly and yet accidentally.Read more at location 457

Following Pseudo-Dionysius and Augustine, Aquinas surpasses pagan neoplatonists who thought that the One and the Good lay beyond the subjective and psychic, ineffably above nous. For these thinkers, since the ultimate transcended mind, our mind could not analogically predicate anything concerning it. Aquinas, by contrast, incorporates Aristotle's idea of the Prime Mover as nous, but, unlike Aristotle, for whom nous was simply self-identical thought thinking itself, introduces a certain note of relationality and difference into God, even before elaborating a Trinitarian theology. Thus he speaks of God's knowledge of all the modes in which He can be participated (in this way, God knows the creation), something of which Aristotle does not speak. God knows things fully in knowing their ends, their perfection, which includes all that they are.Read more at location 462

Aquinas develops an account of how we do in a certain measure participate in the divine knowledge of singulars. God, as we have seen, knows singulars in time precisely because he is timelessly outside them and brings them to be from nothing. However, by stressing the nature of human knowledge as a ceaseless movement and a dynamic interaction between soul and body, Aquinas finds an adequation or approximation to the divine manner of knowing. He elaborates, beyond Aristotle, an account of knowledge as a relay system of signification. To explain this better, one must explicate the 'Aristotelian', 'Augustinian' and 'Thomist' phases in Aquinas's account of understanding.Read more at location 501

In the 'Aristotelian' phase, the form departs from individual material substance, the hylomorphic form/matter compound, and enters on the path of abstraction. As it travels further along this path, the form becomes 'species' and is further abstracted as it passes through the 'senses' of the human observer, then into the imagination, to arrive at the ultimate Aristotelian destination of the Mind. Here the species is received initially by the passive intellect, but then is articulated or expressed by the active intellect, the intellectus agens. Following Augustine, Aquinas describes the product of this expression as verbum, the inner word.54Read more at location 506

Here, in articulating the 'Augustinian' phase, Aquinas suggests, beyond Aristotle, that a concept does not just leave matter behind. For this reason he is less idealist than Aristotle and moreover his greater realism draws on Platonic resources. The fundamental reason for this is theological. For Aristotle, the material element was simply inimical to understanding—it was still to do with irrational formless chaos. But for Aquinas (as for all post-Biblical monotheisms and 'almost' for the neoplatonists), matter is created by God, and therefore itself fully proceeds from Mind. Thus if our mind in order to understand must abstract from matter, this is a deficiency of understanding.Read more at location 512

However, the Augustinian dimension compensates somewhat for this deficiency, because here the concept, as inner word, is like a sign. A sign points away from itself by means of its nonetheless essential mediation, back to what it represents. Thus Aquinas, like Augustine, speaks of all knowledge as intentional, as returning to concrete things that we cannot fully grasp. This concurs with the fusion of intellect as intention with desire, which returns us to things, encouraging us to learn more of them, since to intend something is also to desire to know more of the truth of the thing—this goal being regarded as a good.

Aquinas notes that Plato, and sometimes even Aristotle, was prepared to see knowledge as a kind of motion, and he cautiously concurs. Indeed, Aquinas gives several examples of a real procession in the mind: conclusions, he says, really proceed from principles; an actual conception really proceeds from habitual knowledge; our ideas about the essences of subordinate things proceed from ideas about the essences of higher things.56Read more at location 560

When the mind understands itself, it must proceed from itself, express itself, in an intellectural word. Moreover, this emanative expression, in contrast to Aristotle, transitively proceeds, and in some ways can be seen as craft-like, as a construction or internal operation of art, insofar as the procession of the word involves a development of thought that is originally constitutive of thought, in such a way that there is no original thought without such an expressive elaboration.57Read more at location 564

It is no accident, indeed, that the final and efficient cause—both end and archetype—of external expressions, described in De Veritate as the verbum cordis, should be seen not as a static ideal, but as akin to the interior shaping form of ars involved in all exterior artistic expression. Such an ars or verbum must itself come into being, by a kind of anterior creative supplementation. This suggests that in some way all human knowing is to be seen as an artistic production, which again emphasizes that truth is regarded in ontological rather than epistemological terms, since it is in this way construed as an event rather than as a mirroring.58Read more at location 568

If there can be correspondence of thought to beings, this is only because, more fundamentally, both beings and minds correspond to the divine esse and mens or intellect. Therefore correspondence, for Aquinas, is of what we know according to our finite modus, to God who is intrinsically far more knowable, and yet for us in His essence, utterly unknown. This means that rather than correspondence being guaranteed in its measuring of the given, as for modern notions of correspondence, it is guaranteed by its conformation to the divine source of the given. While to advance to this source is of course to advance in unknowing, it is only in terms of this unknowing, increased through faith, that we confirm even our ordinary knowing of finite things.Read more at location 591

 ___ Hence, while, indeed, Aquinas thinks that the way to fulfil truth for fallen man is by imitation of the God-man (as will be discussed in Chapter Three), more generally he supposes that any truth whatsoever is a participation in the eternally uttered Logos.  there is a logical way of being, a way of things existing in the mind, which for Aquinas is as real as their extramental, material existence  For Aquinas, crucially, being is analogically like knowing and knowing like being. This is what makes Aquinas's theory of truth—unlike modern theories—an ontological rather than epistemological one. Indeed, the conformity or proportion which pertains between knowing and the known introduces an aesthetic dimension to knowledge utterly alien to most modern considerations.13 And, in addition, truth for Aquinas has a teleological and a practical dimension, as well as a theoretical one—that is to say, the truth of a thing is taken as that thing fulfilling the way it ought to be, being the way it must be in order to be true.14 These two dimensions of truth, as the way a thing is and the way it ought to be, come together, because for Aquinas they coincide in the Mind of God  From the very outset, then, Aquinas shows us that he does not intend to refer truth to being, as if it were at a kind of static speculative epistemological remove from being. Rather, he is asking about truth as a mode of existence. This is not, however, to suggest that truth is a particular kind of being, but rather that it is convertible with Being as such in the entirety of both terms  Such a view is, of course, fundamental to the mediaeval tradition of Aristotelianized neoplatonic convertibility of the transcendentals which assumes that Being, which is the focal transcendental, beyond all hierarchical qualifications, is equally close to every level of the metaphysical hierarchy; equally close, that is, to genus, species, substance and accident—an accident, for example, may be less self-standing than a substance, but it just as much exists as does a substance.18 So when one says that Truth is convertible with Being, one is saying that Truth is also a transcendental; that Truth, like Being, shatters the usual hierarchy of categorical priorities in such a way that the humblest creature equally shines with the one light of Truth as the most exalted, and is just as essentially disclosive of it  Now, for Aquinas, one must refer these three Augustinian determinations of Being—Being, Life and Knowledge—to one another, for together they form a circle. As a being, a thing remains in itself; as living, it opens itself through the operations of life towards others; and as known or knowing it returns from others to itself  more mysteriously still, one might say that this circle traces the mediations of a further transcendental, namely, Beauty, which seems to bestow itself obliquely on each of these three stations. Beauty, because it is to do with harmony, fittingness and proportion, including that between being and knowing, is at once invisible and hyper-visible for Aquinas; it is oblique and yet omnipresent  how does Beauty mediate? First of all, insofar as Being is something which resides in itself by a kind of integrity, Beauty is apparent as the measure of that integrity;24 secondly, insofar as Beauty is involved in the manifestation of things in their integrity, without which there could be no visibility, it is fundamental to knowledge; and thirdly, insofar as Beauty is linked with desire (Beauty being defined by Thomas as that which pleases the sight), it is crucial to the outgoings or ecstases of the will and the Good. This role of Beauty, although little explicitly averred to by Aquinas, is actually essential to grasping the character of his theory of understanding.  Beauty shows Goodness through itself and the Good leads to the True,  this sense of something immanently disclosed through something else in an unmeasurable way, but in a fashion experienced as harmonious, is precisely something aesthetic. Every judgement of truth for Aquinas is an aesthetic judgement   because Truth and Being are convertible, one with another, there is a continuity between the way things are in the external material world and the way things are in our mind.  there is a sort of parallel or analogy between the way things are in material or separated angelic substance and the way things are in our minds. It involves a real relation, whereby our thought occasions a teleological realization of the formality of things, and, in doing so, is itself brought to fruition. This realization of things is manifold and complicated (we will say more about this later), but for now let us note that it pertains to the way in which the thinking of things actually brings them to their telos. This happens, because, for Aquinas, truth is less properly in things than in mind—it is usually, as it were, a dormant power until it comes to be known, at which point the power of its truth is awakened  the very notion of a 'thing itself' is radically otherwise, for it is only 'itself' in its being conformed to the intellect of the knower, in its being ordered to a beautiful ratio or proportion. The thing-itself is only itself by being assimilated to the knower, and by its form entering into the mind of the knower.33 Truth is not 'tested' in any way, but sounds itself or shines outwards in beauty  So far, we have seen that, for Aquinas, truth is neither epistemological nor primarily a property of statements. We have seen more positively that it is convertible with Being, that it is a mode of existence and that it is related to a particular aspect of Being, which, according to our modus, is received as a kind of analogical or beautiful assimilation between things  For Aquinas the place of truth is manifold and hierarchical, and one finds it gradually by means of an ascending scale. One might begin by saying that truth is a property of things, that a thing is true if it fulfils itself and holds itself together according to its character and goal.  a thing is deemed 'less true' if it is impeded in some way from its ordinary operations, whether by poison or sickness.  If a thing is truest when it is teleologically directed, and that means when a thing is copying God, this would suggest, as Aquinas indeed affirms, that truth is primarily in the Mind of God and only secondarily in things as copying the Mind of God  when one knows a thing, one does not know that thing as it is by itself, but only insofar as one meaningfully grasps it as imitating God. How very odd this seems, for one would normally regard imitation as a secondary and therefore less authentic operation of life, but here it becomes the highest form of authenticity attainable for material things.37 However, the placing of imitation ahead of autonomy suggests that, for Aquinas, borrowing is the highest authenticity which can be attained.  truth as an idea expresses divine desire—and this is desire for the Good, which brings into our discussion a further transcendental (besides Being and Truth). Like Truth, the Good also concerns Being in its relational aspect. But whereas Truth discloses the relations between things to the intellect—all their combinations and separations—the Good discloses their relations to desire (we have already seen how this disclosure is made manifest by beauty which shows us the relations between things as desirable).  truth is also a property of all finite modes of being insofar as they participate in God. These modes include both individual material substances (such as a stone, a tree, a cricket bat) and also intellectual existences (such as human and angelic minds). This means that truth is in individual material substances and intellectual existences, not in the sense that one might point to them and say that they 'are the case', as for modern theories, but because they imitate God in their appointed modes and aim for their appointed ends. And in performing their various tasks, they analogically show us something of God  We have seen, in the third place, that truth is in the human intellect. It is there in two ways: first, following Augustine, by means of divine illumination,40 and, secondly, following Aristotle, by receiving forms as species from individual material substances  It is this third aspect of truth's being in the human intellect which returns us to what we have described as the 'aesthetic moment' in Aquinas's theory of knowledge. For when the human intellect receives into itself the species of the material substances it knows, it does not know them in the manner of an arraignment of inert facts. Rather, it must always judge or discern whether they are true to themselves.41 This means that even corresponding to finite objects is really only a corresponding to the Mind of God  the mind discerns or grasps an analogical proportion of things to God, and finds here a manifestation of the invisible in the visible.   ne finds something very strange to the modern mind; for where the latter thinks of knowledge as an abasement of subjectivity before the inertly objective, Aquinas sustains, in knowing, a delicate balance between the objective and the subjective. If one requires a beautiful appearance in order to manifest the truth, then while it is indeed the objective that is registered, this registration is only made by the subjectively informed power of rightly desiring sight and judgement. There is, indeed, a certain 'what' which pleases, but this 'what' is only acknowledged as 'pleasing'. Likewise, the invisible really does shine through the visible, and yet this is only apparent for a subtle power of discernment; it is obviously not present in the manner of a 'fact'  Since the tree only transmits treeness—indeed, only exists at all—as imitating the divine, what we receive in truth is a participation in the divine. To put this another way, in knowing a tree, we are catching it on its way back to God.43 One could even say, given the foregoing, that for Aquinas, as he indeed affirms, knowledge is God's perpetual return to Himself. This is not a movement in the sense of a discursive passage from known to unknown, but a kind of encircling, a movement out of Himself and returning to Himself, always already completed from the beginning of eternity. For God, in knowing His own essence, also knows other things in which He sees a likeness of Himself, since He grasps Himself as participable, and so He here returns to His essence  he regards our capacity for thought not as a ruefully humiliated endeavour, but as a partial receiving of divine intellection.  we only exist humanly, that is, according to a higher kind of life, exercising our intellects, by participating in Knowledge. Thus it seems that what is extra to us most defines us; here one must observe that intellection is akin to grace, because the most important part of us is in fact not part of our animal essence at all, but is super-added to us, properly and yet accidentally  Thus he speaks of God's knowledge of all the modes in which He can be participated (in this way, God knows the creation), something of which Aristotle does not speak. God knows things fully in knowing their ends, their perfection, which includes all that they are.  Thus Aquinas, like Augustine, speaks of all knowledge as intentional, as returning to concrete things that we cannot fully grasp. This concurs with the fusion of intellect as intention with desire, which returns us to things, encouraging us to learn more of them, since to intend something is also to desire to know more of the truth of the thing—this goal being regarded as a good. Thus in Aquinas, there is much more sense than with Aristotle, of knowledge as a never completed project  it turns out that we know by participation in divine knowledge; and moreover that this relation to the above is mediated by our turning to the material world below  in the foregoing, there have been several intimations that human knowledge has a self-expressive or creative dimension; not only have we seen that knowledge involves an 'aesthetic' moment whereby one must judge the beauty of a particular proportion, but also that the practice of imitation or mimesis and the exercise of imagination is not merely a passive receiving, but rather one which gathers up images and modifies them   our ideas about the essences of subordinate things proceed from ideas about the essences of higher things  When the mind understands itself, it must proceed from itself, express itself, in an intellectural word. Moreover, this emanative expression, in contrast to Aristotle, transitively proceeds, and in some ways can be seen as craft-like, as a construction or internal operation of art, insofar as the procession of the word involves a development of thought that is originally constitutive of thought, in such a way that there is no original thought without such an expressive elaboration. [This describes dialectic method]  all human knowing is to be seen as an artistic production, which again emphasizes that truth is regarded in ontological rather than epistemological terms, since it is in this way construed as an event rather than as a mirroring [THIS IS HUGE! - EVENTS MEAN HISTORY< WHICH MEANS RELATIONSHIPS ARE AESTHETIC==> TO KNOW GOD IS AN AESTHETIC EVENT]  Therefore correspondence, for Aquinas, is of what we know according to our finite modus, to God who is intrinsically far more knowable, and yet for us in His essence, utterly unknown. This means that rather than correspondence being guaranteed in its measuring of the given, as for modern notions of correspondence, it is guaranteed by its conformation to the divine source of the given. While to advance to this source is of course to advance in unknowing, it is only in terms of this unknowing, increased through faith, that we confirm even our ordinary knowing of finite things  Thus, just as for Aquinas, to correspond in knowing is to be conformed to the infinite unknown, so likewise our knowing of anything at all—however local—is in some measure an advance sight of the beatific vision, and union with the personal interplay of the Trinity

In the most usual interpretations, Aquinas is seen as espousing a sharp distinction between reason and faith, and concomitantly between philosophy and theology. Furthermore, this distinction is viewed as both benign and beneficial: on the one hand, it safeguards the mystery and integrity of faith; on the other hand, it allows a space for modern secular autonomy, while discouraging the growth of political theocracy and hierocratic control of knowledge. The present chapter will, however, argue that this dualistic reading of Aquinas is false. Dualism concerning reason and faith emerges not from Thomas, but rather from intellectual and practical tendencies within the late mediaeval and early modern periods (even if they were somewhat enabled already by the Gregorian reforms with their sharper divide of the lay from the clerical). Moreover, its consequence was not benign, but instead itself encouraged, with and not against early modernity, a theocratic and hierocratic authoritarianism.Read more at location 615

For the more science and politics were confined to immanent and autonomous secular realms, then the more faith appealed to an arational positivity of authority invested with a right to rule, and sometimes to overrule, science and secular politics, whose claimed autonomy, being construable as pure only in formalistic terms, was by the very same token open to substantive breaching. Theocracy required the 'other' realm of the secular in order to have something over which to exert its sway: thus the most theocratic construals of papal authority emerged only in the later Middle Ages, as physicalist theories of the rights of a finite power legitimated by absolute power over lesser powers enjoying, intrinsically, only a limited sway. Quite shortly afterwards, similarly theocratic theories were deployed by absolute monarchs, and the resulting blend of theological voluntarism and physicalist theory of the rights of de facto power is not without echo in the later articulation of totalitarian philosophies.1Read more at location 623

Let it be said straightaway that it is possible to cite passages in Aquinas which appear incontrovertibly to support these positions. Thus he does indeed say that we can know many things by the light of natural reason without appeal to faith.3 And he does indeed say that the theology pursued by philosophy, is able, by the natural light of reason alone, to know God as first cause, which is to say as creator, if nothing more.4Read more at location 645

the intellectus or 'higher reason' enjoys a certain very remote approximation to the divine intuition, or immediate intellectual vision, which operates without recourse to discursive unfolding.8 Hence it enjoys some vision of the pure divine form without matter only known to our modus cognoscendi as the diverse transcendentals of Being, Unity, Truth, Goodness and Beauty. By way of this vision it permits the 'lower reason' in its higher scientific aspect (as identified by Aristotle) to discern by judgement in some measure the 'simple essences' of finite substances as (literally) conveyed into the human mind by way of the senses. Concerning those essences it cannot be deceived, in such a way that here it partakes infallibly of the divine power of intuitive recognition.

Moreover, even in perceiving the contingent combinations of finite essences, we can, indeed, unlike God, be deceived, and must always exercise judgement by questioning just what we do see, and in allowing for deceptive appearances.11 Here the subordinate discursive aspect of the lower reason comes particularly into play. This discursive aspect of the lower reason, while assuming certain scientific principles that are in turn judged in the light of the higher reason's gaze upon the eternal, itself calls again upon the higher light of judgement (by way of analysis), to make its specific intentional pronouncements upon evidence and probable coherencies. In such a circular fashion, ratio and intellectus, while distinguished, nonetheless operate as a single power.Read more at location 692

Thus, when making pronouncements about the truths of external things and in. further realizing these truths within itself (since Aquinas holds that truth resides primarily within the intellect, but secondarily within things),12 the mind continues to be informed by the intellective vision of truth, goodness and beauty. This is essential because Aquinas holds, as we described in Chapter One, that the truth residing in things is not simply their ontological manifestness (though this is crucial, and rules out any epistemological approach to truth, since what if it were universally the case that all beings absolutely hide themselves?) but also a truth to themselves or degree of realization of their own perfection, or own goodness.13Read more at location 699

In contrast to many presentations, therefore, it can be seen that Aquinas's entire treatment of truth must be brought within the domain of his philosophical theology. It is not the case, for Aquinas, that one can be sufficiently assured of some specific truth merely by attending to a feature of the divine Creation, without necessarily recognizing it as created. On the contrary, for Aquinas, one can pronounce no judgement of truth without assessing a degree of appropriate participation in the transcendental attributes proper to divinity (though this is not to say that such an assessment need always be carried out with full reflexive consciousness of the proportio between creature and creator). Were one to attempt to comprehend a finite reality not as created, that is to say, not in relation to God, then no truth for Aquinas could ensue, since finite realities are of themselves nothing and only what is can be true.Read more at location 712

If intellectus offers a certain measure of direct cognitive vision—though never, for now, apart from the discursiveness of ratio—then the 'light of faith' is for Aquinas simply a strengthening of the intellectus by a further degree of participation in the divine light. This strengthening shifts the balance of thought slightly away from discursivity and further towards the divine-pure intuition—since an increase of 'light' means an increase in the relative immediacy of understanding.15 In the case of the operation of reason, we have seen in the first chapter that Aquinas's continued Augustinian and neoplatonic construal of truth as inner illuminatio can nonetheless incorporate (as it could already in Augustine, Proclus, and Dionysius, if not Plotinus) an essential Aristotelian detour through the truth embodied in finite creatures and conveyed to us only via the senses. And while faith involves an intensification of participation in divine intellectual intuition, the same fusion of inner and outer is sustained in the knowledge accessible by faith (although it is just this fusion which is undone in later neoscholastic accounts of revelation).16 Here, also, for faith as for reason, the passive intellect marries the infallible witness of intellectual light to the infallible intuition of the senses (infallible so long as nothing contrary to the ordinary run of nature, such as a mirage, intervenes to distort their deliverances). Thus the paradigmatic scene of revelation, for Aquinas, is represented by the instance of prophecy. Here a supernatural supplement of infused cognitive light is inseparably conjoined with some extraordinary sensory vision, miraculous event, or at least novel historical occurrence.17 Since all these latter three may only, as finite instances, mediate the divine in the shape of enigma, the visions which they offer are partial and can be disclosed in their meaning—and so fully seen—only through acts of interpretation (beginning with the prophet himself), as essential for faith as for reason. Thus while an approach to pure vision is strengthened by faith, it still does not constitute a moment isolatable from discursive mediation.Read more at location 719

It follows that, for Aquinas, revelation offers the extraordinary only in a very qualified fashion. Even the miraculous must be apprehended by the senses in the normal way, and is in continuity with the usual operation of nature insofar as what ultimately matters about both is the meanings they convey, not the equally limited realities which they instantiate. And the extraordinary is indeed confined to the manner or means of disclosure of meaning, since the meaning disclosed is simply divine reality. Thus if reason leads us up to a God unknowable in this life, faith leads us to the same destination, and with the same restriction.Read more at location 735

It is only in post-Baroque conceptions of revelation that faith appears to answer to something 'more'—to new disclosures of information about God and about what God has done. Paradoxically, such newness can appear to throw into relief and to substantiate the pure autonomy of reason. But where, as with Aquinas, 'revelation' denotes simply God's self-disclosure, then no new domain other than that of reason is opened up, since, as we have seen, we are only able to think at all within the arena of the divine self-disclosure and our partial grasp of the divine reditio ad seipsum in which he substantially consists. Thus instead of reason's autonomy being thrown into relief by faith, reason itself, and the goals of reason, are further fulfilled by faith.Read more at location 739

It follows that reason and faith are at the very least construed by Aquinas as successive phases of a single extension always qualitatively the same.

Breaking with Aristotle's alternations and aporias, Aquinas declares that the prime subject of metaphysics is being and not the first cause.18 By 'being' as subject-matter, Aquinas means here its transcendental properties such as 'substance', which need not inhere in matter (rendering them meta-physical) and excludes the 'causes of being' (only secondarily dealt with), which are its first principles, including the first cause: these cannot inhere in matter. One is tempted to say that with this development metaphysics has become a fundamental ontology; however, this transformation was yet to come (with Scotus).Read more at location 753

God only enters into consideration for this newly restricted metaphysics insofar as it is obliged, like any science, as part of its procedure, to inquire into the causes of its subject-matter.19 Again, as with any science, however, this inquiry must be very incomplete since (for Aquinas's set of Platonic/Aristotelian assumptions), the cause of a subject-matter must necessarily transcend it, and so be 'higher' than the effect it produces. By this token, the cause invoked necessarily belongs to the domain of a higher science, above the one being pursued. Hence, in the present instance, metaphysics is able barely to indicate the cause of ens commune, to pronounce it 'God', and to indicate negatively the properties of inconceivable absolute and simple power and undividedness it must possess in order to be able to bring forth actuality.Read more at location 759

Therefore, in this case uniquely, there is a science that can be possessed properly only by that which it is the science of—God, who, being simple, is of course absolutely identical with his own self-understanding.20 The only possible mode of access for human beings to this final science is in consequence by divine self-disclosure, upon which sacra doctrina is based. Like other restricted sciences, sacra doctrina borrows its assumptions and first principles from a higher science, but here this is the absolute science possessed by God and the blessed alone.21Read more at location 769

The new Thomist restriction of metaphysics and consequent confinement of metaphysical knowledge of God to the an est, reserving to sacra doctrina the exposition of the quid est 22 (insofar as some remote intimation of this has been revealed to us), opens, of course, a tempting possibility for mediation between Barth and Aquinas on a post-Kantian basis.23 For if one suggests, as one validly can, that the metaphysical knowledge of God as first cause in Aquinas is both thin and tentative, then the way lies open to stress that for him, as for Barth, all certainty regarding God derives from scripture. Now this stress is by no means false, but it can tend to ignore the fact that, for Aquinas, in an unBarthian fashion, scripture records the event of the augmentation of human intellect through a deepened participating in the divine simplicity. Thus, for Aquinas, it is less that metaphysics is abandoned by reflection on scripture, and much more that it is fulfilled in its intention, but beyond its own understanding of this intention. It is both suspended and subsumed.Read more at location 774

The post-Kantian mediation between Thomas and Barth will turn out to be false, because the weak analogical recourses of metaphysics which reason to God only as first cause are in fact the only terms in which sacra doctrina can receive and comprehend the revelation of God as he is in himself. Since metaphysics can in this way be elevated, its limitations for Aquinas do not amount to the drastic ones perceived by Kant.Read more at location 783

Moreover, in the Summa Theologiae it is clearer than with the Summa Contra Gentiles, that the work throughout belongs to sacra doctrina. If God's unity and perfection are 'demonstrated', they are nonetheless also treated as revealed by scripture and testified to by tradition28 (while, inversely, merely probable arguments are offered for the Trinity). Moreover, scripture primarily, and Christian tradition secondarily, are seen as contributing far more compelling evidence for the intellect (that is to say, as providing, much stronger, because immediately apparent reasons) than the even more weakly intuitive deliberations of philosophy.Read more at location 807

theology has direct recourse to metaphysical scientia—its unarguable principled insights and its discursive arguments—because it is in itself simply the deepening and strengthening of science. This recourse is not at all necessary because of any innate deficiency on the part of sacra doctrina, since, in principle, as the grasp of divine self-knowledge, it is not cognitively deficient in any respect whatsoever—not in relation to philosophy as metaphysics ('first' philosophy), nor in relation to philosophy as the various liberal arts. Rather, it is necessary on account of the innate deficiency of human reason, which cannot, short of the final vision of glory, grasp what is in itself most intelligible, but must explicate this in terms of reasonings clearer to humanity, but in themselves less clear, which is to say, less rational.Read more at location 831

Aquinas, however, by identifying God with non-generic esse, and by specifically excluding God from genus and from substance in the sense either of distinct essence or self-standing individual (though not in the sense of self-subsistent),37 also ensures that there can only be an analogical and not strictly scientific approach to the divine. Hence, for example, his 'demonstrations' of God's existence can only be meant to offer weakly probable modes of argument and very attenuated 'showings'.Read more at location 850

While, for Aquinas, in terms of substance, a thing primarily is said 'to be', and secondarily is said 'to be good' (since mere existence is also good), in terms of its operation it is primarily regarded as 'good' (since operation involves teleology) and secondarily as 'existing'. Yet (as we shall see) the 'second act' of operation is, for Aquinas, itself a superadded degree of esse that is more hyperessential than the 'original' given substance. This suggests strongly that we only grasp esse in its most intense aspect of superaddition to original substance (and essence) under the aspect of goodness (although of course the apprehensions of esse and bonum are only distinct for finite understanding).39 Nonetheless, it suggests equally that, for Aquinas, the guiding apprehension of perfection is not after all of a pre-ontological formal possibility (as it soon became for Duns Scotus) but rather is a dim and remote perception of a plenitude of infinite actuality. The insistence of the ideal is, after all, as much ontological as pre-ontological.Read more at location 869

the only thing that authenticates perfection (and indeed, the only thing that defines it), must be some sort of experience of its actuality. And this is indeed implied by Aquinas's repeated insistence on God's partial communication of his good to creatures, in such a way that their goods can only be understood as good in their pointing away from themselves to the perfection they hint at (their own partial perfection consisting in just this hint).41 That which clinches his exposition of the divine attributes is neither the ascent from effect to first cause nor the a priori grasp of the latter, but rather the (Dionysian) reading of the divine signs and symbols as disclosed in the hierarchies of participating creatures.42 Such an hermeneutic space is, in metaphysical terms,Read more at location 883

For while it is said of metaphysical theology that it can only know that God is (as first cause), what he is not, and by no means what he is, exactly the same restrictions are placed on sacra doctrina.44 It is, therefore, after all not the case that for Aquinas philosophy knows God barely to be, while theology proper declares his nature. To the contrary, it seems that both can do the former, and neither can do the latter. So what does sacra doctrina add, and why are there two theologies?Read more at location 896

Aquinas, after Gregory, insists that one cannot know that a thing is without having some dim inkling of what it is, since nothing is ever manifest or judged as manifest in entirely neutral anonymity. This applies, one might interpolate, even in this extreme limit situation, since to glimpse any boundary, even an absolute boundary, must be to see, however inchoately, beyond that boundary, else one's gaze would pass right through it and one would register no boundary after all.Read more at location 910

Aquinas consistently takes a neoplatonic view according to which an effect is like its cause, indeed pre-eminently exists in its cause. As Jean-Luc Marion astutely suggests, this causal origin is really for Aquinas less Aristotelian 'cause' than the Dionysian 'requisite' (aitid), or attribution to the original source of the 'gift' of the effect in its whole entirety as effect.51 For this view (which entirely circumvents David Hume's correct critique of the metaphysics and physics of causality), a cause does not really 'precede' an effect, since it only becomes cause in realizing itself as the event of the giving of the effect.Read more at location 931   • Delete this highlight Note: This seems important to the question of whether charity is the formal cause of faith

Thus, for Aquinas, in the case of divine causality, the decision to create and the 'eminent' reality of creatures are included in the eternal uttering of the Logos.52 Inversely, an effect does not really come after a cause, since only the effect realizes the causal operation and defines it. In other words, there is always a Humean surplus of pure inexplicable 'succession' which is the apparently random surplus of a new event over the event which precedes it, unless a cause is more than a cause, but rather the entire gift of the effect and the emanation of the effect, which itself defines the cause as cause. (One can see how the Trinity perfects this conception.) Hence the doctrine that effects resemble their causes is not an embarrassing metaphysical residue in Aquinas, but an intrinsic part of an essentially non-metaphysical (!) transmutation of cause, since metaphysics tends to view cause as straightforwardly prior to, and independent of, its effects. As Marion indicates, a reduction of causality to efficient causality fulfils the metaphysical aspiration, and does not withdraw from it, as is usually thought. Given this understanding of causality in terms of requisition and participation, to know God as cause—as supreme form, as supreme goal, as the supreme being, perfection and manifestedness of things—must mean to enter more deeply into effects, in such a fashion that one starts to know more of them also in their source and origin.Read more at location 936

As we have seen, the subject-matter of metaphysics for Aquinas is unequivocally being (whereas for Aristotle it was aporetically and ontotheologically either being-in-general or the first-being [God], in such a way that in a circular fashion God is an instance of being in general and yet being in general is paradigmatically defined in terms of the perfect substance which is God).54 However, the ultimate goal of investigation of a subject-matter, according to Aquinas, is discovery of its cause, and hence God as cause of ens commune is a secondary concern of metaphysics.Read more at location 955

Now physics, for Aquinas, fully accounts for motion, the heart of such realities, in terms of an appeal to the first mover, God. And this pushes us nearer to a cause not simply 'prior' (certainly not temporally, but also in a certain sense already described, not even ontologically), a cause which can alone be adequate, fulfilling the 'requisite'. The 'first mover' emerges as the conclusion of a consideration of the subject-matter of 'moving things'. But as Aquinas's arguments for a first mover (all the five ways, taken together) show, they only work because motion is understood from the outset as being undergone with a purpose, or for a reason, and on account of a goal in accord with a nature. Therefore, if all these motions are themselves unmoved, their very motions—which is to say their purposes, reasons, goals, and natures—are themselves illusory.56 In knowing motions, therefore, which are all aims towards perfections (while the latter are only knowable as participations of the supreme end, the supreme good), the first mover is really radically presupposed. The conclusion to a cause only works because of an initial dim apprehension of the cause as principle.Read more at location 967

Aquinas affirms that all finite being emerges from nothing only as, and through, its likeness to the divine. In keeping with this perspective, he holds that the higher in the scale of being things are (advancing, after Augustine, as we saw in the first chapter, from being through life to intelligence), the more they are defined in their essence not through their 'first act' of subsistent existence such as the 'burning' of fire, but rather through their properly accidental 'second act' (or second perfection) of effective operation (which is also a more intense existing, so that second act is more to be characterized as esse, first act more as essentia)—such as the heating and drying and liquefying caused by fire.60 At the telos of this operation, things are also defined through a 'third perfection' which is the ecstatic attaining to 'something else' that is yet one's goal, one's rest.Read more at location 998

In the first question of the Summa Theologiae, Aquinas asks why, if God can be naturally known, he has to be discursively inferred, and is not immediately apparent. In reply, however, he affirms that there is, indeed, an inchoate ordering of all human reasoning to the beatific vision, the final intellectual intuition of God.68 Thus beneath the distinction of fides and ratio along our temporal ways, lies the much more fundamental contrast between in patria and in via. According to this contrast, both faith and reason are dim anticipations of the final vision of glory. One here finds confirmed the view that, for Aquinas, since a priori reasonings to God are refused, and straightforward a posteriori inductions are equally impossible, discursive reasoning about God must presuppose a disclosure of God to our intellectus, which enjoys a very remote participation in the divine immediacy of vision. In the passage cited, Aquinas compares this remote glimpse to a first sight of 'Peter' in the distance before we know that it is, indeed, Peter who approaches. It is therefore clear that Aquinas, like Augustine before him, associates our continuous approach to the beatific vision with 'the Meno problematic', or the need already to know something before one can possibly come to know it—for how else will one in the first place seek to know it at all? And the same problematic (with the added example of the child first addressing all men vaguely as 'father') is alluded to in the passage in the Commentary on Boethius's de Trinitate already discussed, where it is directly associated with the assertion that we must in some way already know the divine essence in order to affirm God's existence.69Read more at location 1055

From Augustine and Anselm, therefore, Aquinas has inherited a deep identification of the Platonic problematic of knowledge with Christian eschatological tension. For the first two thinkers, reason itself is faith seeking understanding, since for thought to get going it must not only trust its first sight of a man in the distance, but must first believe the reports of others that this is to be called 'man'. And if, for all these thinkers, reason for now can only be faith, then, inversely, faith for now can only develop its insights rationally and discursively, while finally it is destined to be pure intellectus, when we shall see as we are seen (though not enjoy any Hegelian 'comprehension' of the absolute).Read more at location 1068   • Delete this highlight Note: This echoes Hooker's assertion that we believe Scripture only because of the Church's witness

Aquinas introduces a yet more dramatic association of knowledge in general with eschatological vision. In the middle of part one of the Summa Theologiae, he executes the most extraordinary chiasmus. For in expounding the divine attributes, one might expect Aquinas to proceed, after his treatment of being, simplicity and perfection (goodness), quite shortly to transcendental truth and intellection. Instead, before anything has been said of divine intellect or will (approaching 'personhood'), Aquinas details God's presence to creatures, under the heading of divine substance.71 This drastically indicates that God's omnipresence simply is God himself, and that there cannot really be any being 'other' than God. Such omnipresence is seen as the direct effect of divine goodness, and elsewhere Thomas cites Dionysius's 'daring to say' that God on account of his goodness exists 'as it were outside of himself'.72 For only this impossible self-exteriorization will explain how there can be something other to God participating in God, when God is in himself the repletion of being. This impossible conjecture is the most that can be said. In part one of the Summa Theologiae, however, it is added that God is especially and uniquely present to intellect, where 'he dwells as if in his own temple'; also it is made clear that intellect simply is this more intense presence, and that this presence is only by grace.73 Thus at the heart of the chiasmic reversal—Creation and humanity dealt with under divine substance—grace appears for the first time, and in the midst of what some have taken to be an exercise in purely rational theology. One could interpret this to mean that, for Aquinas (and here we press perhaps beyond the nouvelle théologie), all creatures subsist by grace in the sense that they only subsist in their constant 'return' to full divine self-presence, while intellect simply is the consciousness of this return.74 Thus not only is the intellect grace; it is in a sense simply the site of manifestation of the creature, and so of grace.Read more at location 1077

It is only after this description of mind as the event of divine kenotic descent, that Aquinas re-describes it as also the event of eschatological ascent: in other words, his account of the beatific vision is deliberately placed quite shortly after his account of divine omnipresence. In this account, as de Lubac pointed out (thus continuing and recommencing the real theological revolution of the twentieth century),75 Aquinas argues that reason has a natural urge to see the divine essence, since science is unsatisfied till it knows the nature of a cause. And since nature cannot be frustrated, he further argues that this urge must be capable of fulfilment.76 On the other hand, he equally affirms that such a supernatural fulfilment surpasses the capacity of human nature, in such a way that reason can only fulfil its aspiration by grace.77Read more at location 1093

because a nature is fulfilable as a nature; it demands as of right fulfilment, and hence if we are naturally orientated to the supernatural, this can only be because our original and 'most proper' nature is a paradoxically superadded nature (a supreme instance of 'second act'), giving us more than our due as our due, and pulling us naturally beyond our nature in an ecstasis at the outset.Read more at location 1101

But since our mind cannot fulfil its own rationality, except through knowing the divine essence, and since otherwise it would not 'see' that the highest imaginable perfection 'is', whereas it might not be, rendering the world without order or meaning (and imagination mere fiction), there simply would be no 'reason' whatsoever, outside the orientation to beatitude. Mind is the continuing event of this orientation, suspended between the already of a pre-discursive glimpse of the final vision of God, and the not yet of the full realization.Read more at location 1105

The chiasmic reversal is completed when, after the treatment of the creation and finite mind under divine substance, Aquinas proceeds to treat divine truth and intellect under divine operation. Thus to the elevation of our being into the divine substance, answers God's foreshadowing, within himself, of a proceeding beyond himself. And surely this chiasmic structure implies that Aquinas is advancing from an 'impersonal' knowledge of God as One and Good, shared with pagans like Proclus, to a more Christian apprehension of God as intentional mind and will and so as personal. Also, that while the first knowledge may be relatively a matter of rational ascent, the second is only granted through the radical descent of grace (even if Aristotle was able to anticipate fully-divine nous). Moreover, intellection as a more intense presence of God, already suggests that God must first be disclosed if he is to be desired, and thus that in us, as in God, logos must precede will (in God the Holy Spirit)—while only a gracious right-willing and desiring allows us to recognize what appears as a horizon of aspiration.Read more at location 1113

Thus it would appear that reason is not even a 'phase' distinct from faith—though it may offer a lesser degree of intensity—since it is situated in the same 'intense' suspension between time and eternity, and Aquinas affirms, as has been said, that all speculative sciences participate obscurely in the beatific vision. And this interpretation is confirmed by Aquinas's treatment of the historical perspective. Before the fall, reason was perfected by an original grace and righteousness which included an anticipation of the Incarnation in its aspect of glory (as Bruce Marshall has rightly insisted).80 From this we can see that the beatific orientation is always, also, a Christological one. After the Fall, humans lost this original righteousness, and became incapable of obeying the natural law: Aquinas is quite clear, we cannot do any genuinely 'natural' good.81Read more at location 1121

Equally, as Bruce Marshall has also pointed out, Aquinas declares that the 'partial' knowledge of God enjoyed by the pagans is no knowledge at all, since, given the divine simplicity, to know only some of the divine attributes is not to know any of them properly (and we shall see later, that the exposition of the Trinity completes the account of divine simplicity).82Read more at location 1128

However, as Eugene Rogers has stressed, since God's creative action is not to be thwarted, the original righteousness becomes, after the fall, immediately available again as redeeming grace, already present in natural and historical typological anticipations of Christ.83 For Aquinas, indeed, 'the invisible things of God' in Romans always made visible everywhere, suggested precisely a manifestation of the divine essence, which can only be made available by grace.Read more at location 1131

So what may be unstated by Aquinas, and is yet everywhere implicit, is that there is a radical inconsistency between Aristotle's claim, on the one hand, that metaphysics is the science of being which is transgeneric, and his claim, on the other, that as an architectonic science it only lays down an abstract ground plan, leaving the details of intellectual treatment to other sciences whose narrower scope is yet beyond its own competence. For if metaphysics deals with being, then surely it should deal with all there is. Surely it should be as variously artisanal as it is architectonic? At this juncture a formal/material distinction becomes deconstructible: the most general categories which we must presuppose—being, unity, truth, goodness, etc.—can only be formally defined through the endless empirical task of material description and re-description of an infinite number of particulars: metaphysics here becomes also history.Read more at location 1150

God's self-knowledge, as simple, is at once formal and material, and therefore exceeds the metaphysical as the ground of the historical. For whereas the self-thinking of the Aristotelian first mover is abstract, and does not extend to material particulars and so is 'metaphysical', the self-thinking of God, for Aquinas, includes all the exact details of every way in which he can be participated.87 Therefore it is only architectonic to the degree that it is also artisanal, and only lays down the formal ground plan as the ideal comprehensive esse of the entire construction: since God's theoria is also practice, his 'preceding' idea is only realized with the completed 'work' of his emanating verbum.88Read more at location 1158   • Delete this highlight Note: This supports my thesis against Ramism,

It is in consequence clear that, as Marion now rightly declares, Aquinas entirely alienates esse to God.90 But in that case, since the divine essence which is esse is only disclosed to sacra doctrina, he also alienates esse in toto to sacra doctrina (and likewise subsistence, form and essence, since these also, as shown in section III, belong properly to God alone and are superadded along with esse).Read more at location 1170

However, Aquinas's Aristotelian criticisms of Plato with respect to theology (for example in the Commentary on the de Causis)92 again and again involve: (1) the refusal of many forms as inconsistent with monotheism; (2) the refusal of forms prior to the intellect as inconsistent with a personal God; and (3) the refusal of matter as privative as inconsistent with Creation. In other words, the Aristotelian critique of Platonic theology (as Aquinas supposed it to be), is basically a bolstering of a Christian critique.Read more at location 1178

However, in his early Commentary on Boethins's de Hebdomadibus, Aquinas, after Boethius, faced a dilemma: if created substances are only good as receiving good from God, that is, by participation, then how can they be said to be good at all, good in themselves, good in their substance?93 Solving this dilemma in part motivates Aquinas's switch of emphasis from bonum to esse: for he argues that it is subsistent existence, as a participant in esse, that is itself the most fundamentally participatory thing. Hence, a thing can be good of itself, and yet also good only by borrowing, since its very own being is the most borrowed thing of all. But, at the same time, and inversely, that which is lent by God, granted to be participated in, is primarily the gift of relative self-standing, in accord with the Dionysian idea that God's goodness is his 'standing outside of himself'. Both these notions reconstrue participation as grace and kenosis, but they do not add grace and kenosis to participation.Read more at location 1183

But since we, as embodied creatures, can only enjoy an intense intuition via the senses, we now aspire higher only by attending more closely to the lower sensory realm to which God condescends. As metaphysics is now for sacra doctrina history, our reasoning must occur much more through images, narratives, and liturgical offerings. Above all, it is sacra scriptura as read, manifested, and performed (for it was not yet a discrete, foundational and merely written text), which now shows us science at its most scientific.100Read more at location 1220   • Delete this highlight Note: This pretty much says it all for my thesis about the performance of Scripture

for Aquinas there is only one never-fully-realized temporal passage from metaphysical discursivity with its incapacities fully to think the transgeneric (or to comprehend the formal as the material and vice versa), to the perfect vision of the divine self-understanding. But the mark of progress along this via is increasingly to see such historical development as itself the cognitive goal—itself the continuous manifestation of the transcendental. This is to look in history for the complete divine descent which can alone correct our wilfully wayward vision (which cannot see the invisible which is fully manifest in the visible)—a descent always presupposed as the only possible sustaining of original righteousness, but a descent which, much more emphatically, we are always yet to arrive at, even anno domini, as our final conclusion.Read more at location 1225

Is it not the case, however, that Aquinas considers that natural reason can know God as one, and as creator, whereas faith is required to know God's inner life as triune? The first half of this contention must be considered false; first, because we have seen that the understanding of God as intellectual and willing, and so as creative, presupposes grace; and, secondly, because creatures are causally referred to the divine esse, which as transgeneric and inclusive of all reality is revealed as a divine name, not infallibly inferred.Read more at location 1233

it is within the field of relation that the transcendentals 'Good' and 'True', along with willing and knowing, are instantiated. For the Good concerns the intrinsic proportionate ordering of one thing to another, a real relation, while the True concerns the presence of one thing in another: a merely one-sided relation secundum dici with respect to the thing known, but a real relation with respect to the knowing power and its expression of its knowledge of the other.102Read more at location 1242

Thus analogy presupposes not just a metaphysics of participation, but also a phenomenology of participation, although this is not to say that the latter founds the former.115 This is not the case, because there is, for Aquinas, no indefeasible original intuition of participated esse outside a (discursively mediated) judgement that this is the case, expressed within an entire conceptual and linguistic apparatus handed down to us from tradition. Thus for him, as for Augustine, the 'vision' of Peter approaching from the distance, will be initially also a received report of his approaching, the witness of others which conceptually frames our expectations of what we will come to see. For us, intuition is never prior to judgement supplemented by argument, which is preformed by language and tradition; there is no 'raw experience'.116 Indeed, to ignore the non-visual dimension of oral report, historicity and judgement which fractures and yet essentially informs vision, is to reduce vision to a post-Ramist and Cartesian art of precise survey, which overlooks the truth that we only cognitively see in the light of an unseeable intellectual sun—all those obscure yet essential 'assumptions' which alone clarify everything else. For this problematic lacuna of darkness within the visible itself—which, nonetheless, for all creatures constitutes the visible—discursivity must seek to substitute, by rendering itself the means of showing the unshowable which illuminates.Read more at location 1346   • Delete this highlight Note: This is precisely the point I am making about Hooker's anti-Ramism

one can develop a point concerning Trinitarian ontology that is only latent in Aquinas. The Augustinian ascending triad, being/life/intellect (where the two later degrees represent more intense being) is qualified in its hierarchy at the point where, within intelligent creatures, the orientation of the will towards the Good picks up again the motion of life towards a goal outside itself, whereas the intellect fulfils itself as relation to the other within itself (as has been discussed in Chapter One and earlier in the present chapter).Read more at location 1502

sin renders our finite vision of infinite perfection vague and uncertain. Indeed, so blinded are we, that our vision can only be restored by the descent of perfection in time, in such a way that here we see the infinitely perfect entirely in the finite with our sensory eyes as performed thought which is also the personal substantive Son, who both realizes and lets proceed a true desire manifest in the substantive Eucharistic community.Read more at location 1548

It has been shown how, in three ways, Aquinas's sacra doctrina bends metaphysics into history: transgeneric esse fulfilled in theology converts the formal into the material; the redefined science of sacra doctrina grasps divine intuition only through descent to sensory intuition; finally, the 'reversed supplementation' of the Trinity validates history as the horizontal route of our vertical ontological supplementation: here truth is slowly engendered through our desiring anticipation of our final goal. And indeed, beneath even this initial turn towards our mode of animal 'life', divine grace which is the gift of the Spirit first meets us as a kind of quasi-physical 'motion', revealing here also the artisanal reach of divine knowledge beyond the architectonic sway of metaphysics.Read more at location 1601

On the basis of the second consideration (and we can add the first and third), Michel Corbin argues that Aquinas deliberately fulfils speculation in its surpassing, as a reflection upon, and liturgical re-offering of, sacred history.148 One might support this argument by suggesting that Aquinas here follows through the Dionysian legacy of theurgic neoplatonism. For this tradition (Proclus and lamblichus), since the forms are only 'recollected' through ever-renewed reminders in time, the soul cannot be elevated above time and the body (as for Plotinus, less faithful to Plato's texts and the esoteric traditions of the academy). Therefore, in order to encounter the divine, we must rely less on theoretic ascent than on a divine descent, which nonetheless is partially enticed through certain regular ritual performances.Read more at location 1607

In worship, supremely, we at once make and see, envisage in performing, thereby realizing Aquinas's vision of actuality as light.149 Since God is not an object in the world, he cannot be available to us before our response to him, but in this response—our work, our gift, our art, our hymn—he is already present. Moreover, such poetic, theurgic, sacramental presence, is for Christianity, as not for neoplatonism, also a fully theoretical, intellectual presence, since, with the Trinity, Christianity has succeeded in thinking thought as absolute and simple, precisely because it no longer thinks of it as reflexion, but as relation, poesis and vision. (It is orthodox Trinitarianism and not neoplatonism, nor German idealism, as we have seen, which is intellectualist.)Read more at location 1616

For Thomas Aquinas, in a post-lapsarian economy, the Incarnation is the sole ground for the restoration of our participation in the divine understanding. Consequently, for us, not only are things true only as participating in God; also they are only true as conjoined to the body of the incarnate Logos. Aquinas therefore insists that, besides being sole bearer of grace to us, Christ is alone our reliable teacher, who restores for us also truth and knowledge.Read more at location 1634

In this way, as we saw in Chapter One, a thing is 'true' to the degree that it participates in the divine standard for its own realization. Hence in pronouncing on and manifesting the truth of a thing, the human intellect itself assesses it in the light of this standard, and its sense of how manifest a thing is, or how manifest ('true') the intellect can make it, is inseparable from its sense of its perfection or appropriate goodness. Moreover, as we further concluded, this assessment is itself a registering of the inscrutable 'proportion' that pertains between the being of things and the human intellect—an analogical proportion which Aquinas specifically identifies as a participation in transcendental beauty.14Read more at location 706

the divine intellectual intuition can only be fully manifest to human nature through a coincidence with our sensory intuition, where, alone for us, a certain immediacy is possible. Now we see that, for Aquinas, the site of this immediacy is touch rather than vision. And touch, it has been shown, is only intuitive as active and shaping. In keeping with this, our sacramental re-education is not primarily a matter of looking. Thus, as we shall see in Chapter Four, Aquinas considers liturgy very much as something we must with our hands shape and perform, concluding his final summa with detailed instructions as to what we are physically to do, and why.Read more at location 2212

it is fitting that, since we fell through Adam's pride and the rebellion of our sensual aspect, we should be restored through divine humility and re-education of the understanding by the senses.8 Christ follows and shows us the path through suffering and despair to a despising of our mortality and the regaining of eternal life. This shows that while, for Aquinas, God could have restored us just through his continued gift, he nonetheless so respects human freedom and the legacy of human history, that he seeks also positively to forgive us, by tracing, himself, as only an innocent man can, the perfect ways of penitence which we are to imitate.9Read more at location 1684

Here Aquinas is exploiting to the full the Dionysian paradox of God 'existing outside of himself' which was discussed in the previous chapter. Just because there is no outside to God, God can entirely externalize himself; he can most freely and ecstatically exceed himself. Just because he cannot share anything, he can share everything. It is partially because of his intense sense of this paradox, that Aquinas espouses ontologically strong notions of human deification. Adam was created to enjoy the beatific vision, and to share, without reserve, but to the measure of human personhood, in the divine nature.11 Likewise, for Thomas (unlike some mediaeval theologians, for example Duns Scotus), Adam enjoyed already a state of semi-beatitude in Eden, receiving sanctifying grace, and possessing an impassible body.12 Significantly, Aquinas cites the predestination of Adam to deification as a further ground for the convenientia of the Incarnation: humanity has a natural kinship with the supernatural; it bears the image of God—somewhat, albeit remotely, as the Son bears the image of the Father, since human beings as intelligent already possess close kinship with the divine substance (as we saw when expounding the 'chiasmus' of the Prima Pars in Chapter Two). Aquinas indeed says that, as the Word of creation, the Son has special 'kinship' with all creatures; however, this is far stronger in the creature able to articulate a word on its own account. Moreover, since man is capable of this rational articulation and yet remains material and animal, he is able to synthesize the whole work of creation, in a way the angels do not. It is 'appropriate' that this finite microcosm be conjoined with infinite plenitude, and in this way a certain 'cycle' is completed.13Read more at location 1692

For the hypostatic union involves the integration of Christ's humanity through the divine personhood, in such a way that his strictly human qualities show entirely, in their very humanity, his divine nature. This includes his body, his physical actions, and especially his transmission of the substance of his body to the Eucharistic elements. Because, for Aquinas, all our knowledge is first in our senses, this means that we first encounter Christ in reported word and image concerning his physical manifestation, and yet more directly in our partaking of the sacraments, particularly the Eucharist.14 It is in this fashion that there is realized, for Aquinas, that aspect of convenientia, already mentioned, which is the instruction of our intellect in divine matters by our senses, to correct the turning of the intellect to sensory ends rather than divine ends after Adam. For when we imagine Christ who is perfect, our imagination is wiser than our fallen reason; when we hear of Christ, our hearing is wiser than this reason; when we taste Christ, our tongue is wiser than this reason, and only after the tasting will it once again speak reason.Read more at location 1727

Of course, through this process our reason is once more slowly re-instructed and thereby resumes its command. But does it altogether? For the reversal is permanent; it belongs with the permanence of the hypostatic union and its sacramental representation. And therefore it makes sense that the Aquinas who invoked the felix culpa pronounced at the Easter Vigil, was also the Aquinas who promoted the feast of Corpus Christi. For since bread and wine are now transubstantiated, forever and forever in time (and beyond?), something material is in excess of our spirits, and our minds must obey our senses, here re-attuned.Read more at location 1736

But to grasp the real implication of this new sacramentality of the cosmos, we must recall, once again, its sole ground in the hypostatic union. For if, here, finite ascending convenientia, or truth, absolutely coincides with infinite eternal convenientia, or truth, then this implies an extraordinary elevation of human sensory intuition. This follows, because, first, the infinite truth is divine intuition; and, secondly, human knowing, which is fully preserved in its integrity in Christ's humanity, is only entirely intuitive (as opposed to a remote participation in intellectual intuition) in sensation. Thus if divine and human truth are to coincide, the 'immediacy' of the former will only be displayed in human existence (even if it also perfectly suffuses all of Christ's discursive deliberations), through Christ's sensory intuitions, and our sensory intuitions of Christ.Read more at location 1743

Nevertheless, through this intensification, the conclusion of sacra doctrina also recasts the entire character of sacra doctrina. For hitherto, Aquinas has said (from the inception of the Prima Pars) that this teaching is a science, indeed the most scientific science, because it derives its certainty from the very fount of all certainty. Nevertheless, this certainty of science is not matched by an equal certainty of derivation, since while God reveals to us something of his absolute certainty, this is only through the approximation of appropriate analogues, whose material imagery, in particular, renders them at best remote indicators. This non-demonstrative character of our modus of knowing disqualifies theology as a strictly theoretical science. In the fourth part of the Summa Contra Gentiles, however, Aquinas (already apparently anticipating the demand of the Summa Theologiae that theology, as concerning God, should be fully scientific) had already suggested that if we know the vision of God to be our true end, we must possess 'a certain foretaste' of this by faith—and that this foretaste must be 'most certain knowledge' if it is to act as 'the principle of everything ordered to the ultimate end'. In other words, to be in the truth we must orientate ourselves to absolute ontological certainty beyond our grasp, and so start with faith, and yet faith (as no longer infallibly guided since the Fall) is shaky and uncertain. To resolve this aporia and attain perfect certainty, man 'had to be instructed by God himself made man'. That is to say, for us to be able to begin to think with a kind of 'certainty', the goal of such thought had to arrive before our eyes. Aquinas cites John xi. 18: 'no man has seen God, but the only-begotten Son, he has declared him'. And for analogical reasoning to be reliable for fallen humanity, the very inappropriateness of material images had to be disclosed as, after all, in this one instance, wholly appropriate as the vehicle of truth. Aquinas therefore declares here that the materiality of the Incarnation alone renders theology a science. He repeats this point in the Tertia Pars: only the Truth incarnate founds faith.Read more at location 1758

It can be noted here that, curiously enough, Aquinas's near-mono-physitism is much less fetishistic of the particular than Scotus's near-Nestorianism. For where Christ's integral specificity is God, and so also the universal, then it is a very strange sort of specificity which we can scarcely identify. Normally, the specific is framed by the universal; it is an item visible under the sun. But here, uniquely, the specific itself frames our vision of all other specificities: it is itself the very sun we see by. Its concreteness and particularity is therefore hyper-concrete—so concrete that its reality overwhelms all else, and its very over-apparentness renders it scarcely manifest at all as a discrete item. This circumstance—especially when allied to the disclosure of the Logos in the vulnerability of Christ (as will shortly be elaborated)—absolutely prevents any Christological encouragement of Christian triumphalism or exclusivity. The Incarnation sacralizes no one site, with a resultant secular draining of all other sites: to the contrary, its sacral reality tends to the proliferation of sacred sites as uncontrollable by any institutional force. By contrast, where, as with Scotus, Christ is allowed some independent merely human and therefore ontic existentiality, the very 'lowness' of this Christology ensures that Christ is reduced to a locatable human idol to be possessed and manipulated by a Church thinking of itself primarily as a legally-bound institution.Read more at location 1862   • Delete this highlight Note: This speaks to Hooker's ecumenism, and to his resistance to delimiting the church to the 'holy.'

the Logos does not 'become' incarnate—rather, a human soul and body come to subsist in the Logos. All real relationality is on the side of this soul and body, but it is a relationality so real that it is exhaustively constitutive of this soul and body. It is akin, says Aquinas, to a movable object's being moved to the left of a fixed object; the leftness does not impinge on the substance of the fixed object, even though it is thereby rendered to the right. But the new left position of the movable object is brought about through its being resituated in real relation to the fixed object.26 In the Christological instance, it is as if something were subsistent arrived-at-leftness.Read more at location 1893

Aquinas, for the sake of what is at issue, has to imagine handedness (and tonguedness), counterfactually as an 'addition' to humanity; however, he alludes also to a closer, because supranormal, analogue: the instance of a man possessing a sixth finger. The Incarnation, he suggests, can be compared with such a growth, because while a sixth finger is an accidental deformity in relation to the human essence, it nonetheless becomes an integral part of this man's personal being, because it is useful to him (and may even, one can add, afford him greater skills and capacity in certain respects).29 In deploying these examples, Aquinas is concerned with the relation between the human essence, which is an animal rationality, on the one hand, and the bodily organon most habituated to touch, on the other (and the tasting of the tongue represented for Aquinas, as for Aristotle, a more intimate mode of touch).Read more at location 1916

In the course of the De Anima, Aristotle provided a remarkable analysis of touch. He noted that in the case of every other sense there is always a medium between sense and the thing sensed. Thus vision requires intervening light; sound, intervening air. However, in the case of touch, there seems to be no medium, and instead touching is experienced as a registering of the immediate.30 In the case of sight, for example, the medium of light is first moved and then this medium moves us. But in the case of touch we seem to be directly moved by the source, despite the relation between different surfaces: Aristotle gives the analogy of the penetration of a body by a spear through a shield. It is not that the spear first moves the shield, and then the shield moves the body; rather the spear directly penetrates the body.31 And this appears to be the case with all instances of touch: what senses, namely the psyche, is directly affected by the corporeal.Read more at location 1937

Short of the self-knowledge of absolute nous, there is no real immediacy, and every material finite contact involves a third element, which is the shared domain which permits contact (for Aristotle, there is no vacuum). Sensation as a finite material movement therefore also involves a medium. This circumstance (one may interpolate) can also be grasped phenomenologically: that object which I physically encounter can only be experienced as other to me if its corporeality is other to mine, and it can only be experienced as an item within the world, rather than as the entire world which envelops me, if between me and the object there lies a shared worldly space. (If this space can itself be specified, it will in turn be an item within the world and not the enveloping world in toto.) Perception, as such, therefore has a triadic structure.Read more at location 1945

For Aristotle, sensation must be an experience as well as a reality of mediation, and therefore he implicitly appeals to an unstated phenomenology of the kind outlined in the previous paragraph. And he is aware of the phenomenological structure at least to the degree that he provides a negative example of it in noting that an object brought right up against the eye is no longer visible.34 Thus he gives an empirical example of the absolute necessity of experienced mediation for perceiving, even if he does not elaborate the phenomenological ground for this.Read more at location 1957

Aristotle must therefore show that, after all, in touching something, we experience mediation. And his demonstration here is remarkable. Since the contact of the body with the thing outside itself is experienced as physically immediate, in such a way that from an experienced physical point of view, the toucher entirely fuses with the thing touched, our body itself must be the medium. Otherwise, we would not experience the thing touched as other, and so would not experience it as anything specific at all, just as we only register an object held too close to our eye as a blinding darkness.Read more at location 1962

But what is the body a surface between? Clearly it can only be an interface between (informed) matter and the pure spirit (forma formaruni) of the soul.35 In effect, what Aristotle has already discovered here, long before Husserl and Merleau-Ponty (who, following Brentano, drew upon this text), is that the body is not just another object in the world of which we are aware. Rather, as the embodied condition of possibility of awareness, it is, as body, quasi-subjective, and is also the mysterious sphere of mediation between subjective and objective, psyche and hule. The mysterious character of this mediation is apparent in the fact that it is the body in its most earthly material aspect as the immediacy of touch (which is obviously related to 'efficient' causality), which serves as the transition to psyche. For it is the physical capacity of the body to mediate touch which actually proves for Aristotle that there is a spiritual, psychic interior to the body which allows it to be body. Thus: we touch things bodily; bodies, however, do not themselves touch, since then there would be no mediation and no touch; therefore it is the soul which touches through bodies. Touching proves and manifests the psyche. Or, to put this in more contemporary terms: in the case of touching, one is conscious in, but also through the body, of contact from without.Read more at location 1966

To return to Aristotle: in the case of touch, uniquely, it turns out that the body itself is a medium, but no longer a physical medium. Rather, it is the interface between the physical itself and the psychic. In this way, touch 'proves' the soul, which is also, for Aristotle, following Plato, 'proved' by the experience of 'common sense', whereby we are able to relate inherently disparate sensory experiences together, experiencing the same thing, for example, to be loud, red and hard—or, indeed, loud, red and yielding.37 Here the senses must be themselves sensed, according to an 'inward' measure, which grasps invisible harmonies and proportions between them.Read more at location 1998

Nevertheless, if the psyche grasps the hidden proportion amongst the heterogeneous senses, it is only in touching that it experiences the proportion between psyche and sensing itself.

hypersensitivity of touch and intelligence are inseparable. In consequence, Aquinas, directly following Aristotle, insists that human beings are the prudentissimum of all animals,39 because they have the strongest sense of touch: presumably this is related to our nakedness (relative lack of body hair), as well as to our handedness. But he specifically mentions the power of the human tongue, which has a far more exact sense of taste than with any other animal: here one can see that Aquinas is close to the insight that cuisine is a fundamental basis of human culture, and indeed intelligence.40 By contrast, according to Aquinas, there are examples of animals being better endowed than humans in every sense other than that of touch.41Read more at location 2008

too hard a touch not only numbs this sensation, but in numbing the entire body, may also kill it. Thus the relationship of touch to the mere utility of survival, also, for Aristotle, provides it with an existential relationship to life and death.44 This should cause us to reflect on the way in which touch, like the other senses, is also a proportio, a harmony. Aristotle explains, as we have seen, how to touch mediates proportionately between soul and touchable bodies; he also declares that it is a 'kind of mean between all tangible qualities'.45 But if touching both preserves one's own life and destroys other life (though also gives it, one might add), then we can infer that it is a kind of mean between all living things, and even a kind of mediation between the life and death of the body. We can further suggest that this standing between the life and the death of the body, is the ground, in human beings, for its standing between soul and body, and the allowing of the remove of consciousness. Consciously to understand life has, as its concomitant, the possibility that one can deliberately destroy it—as well as the consciousness that one can be destroyed.Read more at location 2031

But now the paradox, whereby the baseness of touch proves soul, has been much intensified. For it will be recalled that, for Aristotle, a strong thought cannot overthrow mind. Yet now we see that touch is at the opposite, weak extreme of such intactness: whereas a loud sound deafens, but cannot kill the hearer, too strong a touch can slay. Therefore, whereas the life of thought (remembering that psychic intelligence is a kind of life, specifically for Aquinas, after Augustine, but also, by inference for Aristotle), as the life of thought, is absolutely inviolable, the life that touches and is touched, is absolutely and existentially vulnerable. Intelligence might salvage all life; touch might endanger all life.Read more at location 2040

Aquinas asks why touch should more correspond to fitness of mind than sight, which seems more spiritual, and 'reveals more of the distinguishing characteristics of things'.46 In answering this, he says, first of all, that since touch is diffused over the whole surface of the body, all the senses partake of touch, and are, indeed, variants of touch (this is indicated less explicitly by Aristotle). It is in virtue of touch that anything is called sensory, and therefore better touch means better sensory adjustment in general. And since, for Aquinas following Aristotle, what is in the intellect was first in sense, high intelligence is inseparable from acute sensory perception (even if the reverse is also true).Read more at location 2053

touch is much more reflexive than either sight or sound (and this is another reason for its closer kinship with intelligence). When we see an object we do not see our sight, but focus away from ourselves upon this object. But when we touch an object we also touch this touch, since we are also touched by the objects in a way that instinctively arouses personification and apostrophe (the 'soothing touch of silk'; 'that horrible bump' and so forth). Since we experience also the object touching us, there is an instant rebound to self-attention, in such a way that we at once touch also our own touching.Read more at location 2141

In the case of sight and hearing, this 'double passivity' is guaranteed by the intervention of the palpable physical medium—they are like signalling by flashlight or radio across the English Channel: more like a prelude to fraternization or conflict, but not these realities themselves. In touching, however, where there is no palpable medium, the thing touched tends much more to affect us directly: it can stop us, hurt us, alter us, soothe us or damage us. And this circumstance brings about the rebound of touch: without the interval of a palpable medium, what we touch in touch is the touching, not simply the other, held at a distance.Read more at location 2150

However, to touch touching in this way is to lose any perspective of safe distance upon the thing sensed by which we can assess it and place it in a context. Touching is not just close to us, but always 'too close', so close that we have no physical perspective upon it. Touching is sublime, saturated sensation, even if it is always somewhat beautiful, proportioned and specific. It overwhelms us and thereby moves us from our previous state. Since assessment of an object depends upon our own stability, touch does not allow us to assess the thing touched. All that we can assess is the touching, the resultant new relation, but this assessment is only possible because of our psychic distance from touching, which prevents a total overwhelming which would always be sensory death and oblivion.Read more at location 2156

In the case of the other senses, it seems that we enjoy a discrete, inviolable intuition of a sensed object. But in the case of touching, we only intuit the event of encounter, and it is not the sense but the mind which intuits. Only, of course, our finite minds scarcely intuit at all, and so if the event of touching at the surface of bodies is only intuited by 'removed' mind, then in this case sensory intuition only occurs when it has already passed over into intellectual discursivity, discrimination and judgement. What is touched is only intuited as intended by active mind. Thus to the external active character of touch (which moulds as much as it is moulded), corresponds the internal active character of the psyche which, alone, is what consciously touches. So, once again, we see just why the touching hand is the supreme organ of intelligence.Read more at location 2161

In the previous chapter it was suggested that, in Aquinas, a latent phenomenology possessed no privilege over against a primacy of active judgement and interpretation, but that, instead, his thought implied an equipoise of seeing and making. Now we can see just how radically this is confirmed by his advocacy of the Aristotelian priority of touch. For if all sensing is in a measure touching, then in all sensing we primarily touch touching and not the touched object. In seeing, what we see is as much the object looking at us, locating us, defining us, judging us, as us looking at the object. Likewise with hearing. In this way, perception is so radically inter-objective at the outset, as to forestall any later phenomenological problematic about intersubjectivity. Likewise, if all sensation is a mode of touch, things can only be intuited by mind, which is really to be intuited as always already intended, discussed, discriminated and judged conjecturally in relation to an unlimited horizon.Read more at location 2168

Returning, now, to Aquinas's Christological concerns, one must ask about the significance of his occasional, but very marked, attention to touch, in the midst of a discourse suffused throughout by light and illumination. Normally, it would seem, the intuition of sight is offered as the best analogue for divine intuitive understanding. However, if touch is more integrally related to human intelligence, and touch reveals the essential character of all sensory intuition, then it would seem that divine intuition must, eminently, be 'touch'. And then, whereas in the previous chapter we spoke of the divine understanding as the coincidence of 'seeing' with 'making', now we can see that to describe this understanding as intuitive 'touching' would encompass both aspects.Read more at location 2181

It has already been suggested that this thematic of touching provides some sort of natural ontological ground for the event of ontological reversal which follows for Aquinas from the Incarnation, whereby our senses must now educate our understanding. If 'touch' seems to hold the balance between mind and body, then sacramental touching anno domini seems to shift the balance towards body. But how can there be revision even of finite ontological order? For it reflects an order that eternally pertains between finite and infinite; and part of this order (at least we assume) is the priority of mind over body. However, if intellect knows through touching, and the ratio of mind to body consists in the medium of touch, then we have seen that touch, more than other sensing, is an interactive event (and not a passive registering). Hence the priority of touch discloses the relation of mind and body to have the character of event, and events are revisable. Here ontology itself expects self-revision.Read more at location 2198

There are certain hints in Aquinas that the ontological reversal accomplished by the Incarnation pivots about touch. We have already seen that the absolutely new ontological possibility realized by the hypostatic union is compared by him to the conjoining of a hand to a person as his 'proper instrument' of touch and formation. As a 'proper accident', this hand is involved in the event and events of touching which are contingent, and yet fully belong to the person who touches. Likewise the human nature comes, in time, to inhere in the Logos, yet now existentially belongs to it, in the most absolute sense.Read more at location 2207

the divine intellectual intuition can only be fully manifest to human nature through a coincidence with our sensory intuition, where, alone for us, a certain immediacy is possible. Now we see that, for Aquinas, the site of this immediacy is touch rather than vision. And touch, it has been shown, is only intuitive as active and shaping. In keeping with this, our sacramental re-education is not primarily a matter of looking. Thus, as we shall see in Chapter Four, Aquinas considers liturgy very much as something we must with our hands shape and perform, concluding his final summa with detailed instructions as to what we are physically to do, and why.Read more at location 2212

Finally, for Aquinas, it belongs to the convenientia of the Incarnation that Christ should mediate to us what is most certain in itself, namely divine truth, through what is most certain for us, namely the directly touchable by the senses. The disciple Thomas, as the angelic doctor Thomas recalls, was permitted to ease his doubt by touching the wounds of the resurrected Christ,53 and we are permitted to encounter God through the most intimate and discerning touch of all, which is that of the tongue in taste. For Aquinas, as for Augustine, the Eucharist most of all accomplishes a reversal. Normally food and drink are to nourish the body, which is to sustain the mind. But here the mind is not only to attend to what it eats and drinks, which can alone instruct it in the truth; it is even—after Augustine—to become this food and drink, which makes present the truth incarnate. Ordinarily, food and drink become us; here we are to become this food and drink. And in this case, at last, the exclusiveness of touch which permitted its penetration, is conjoined with that generality and commonality hitherto peculiar to sight and hearing. For when we touch the body and blood of Christ, we touch everything, and infinite others may touch all the same points of this body at the same time.Read more at location 2217

Thus another ontological revision has been effected. In the Eucharist, touch as taste ceases to be restrictive in its exclusivity. Instead, from now on, if we wish to see the universal, to see God, we must aspire to touch and shape in truth, along with all other people, every last finite particular as included within and disclosing the body of Christ. Henceforward, the journey to God is equally the journey to the God-Man, and so equally to all creatures, and no longer away from them.

All the above considerations concerning touch, and finite ontological revision on the basis of touch, remain, however, incomprehensible, unless we can understand how this revision affects the relation of finitude to the infinite. The latter cannot alter, and any relation of the finite to it, must appropriately reflect this binding character. Therefore, one must assume that the ontological revision of the finite which establishes the hypostatic union, since it establishes thereby a higher finite reality, discloses something new about God, hitherto unknown to us. Likewise, since the hypostatic union entails the further ontological revision which is the exalting of the sensory and further exhibition of the priority of touch (in such a way that one can, for Aquinas, even say of the finite human nature in Christ, by virtue of the one esse, that 'it creates'), we must assume that this exalting and exhibition also discloses something new about God. Since the way to divine truth is now somewhat different, some new character of truth in God must thereby be shown.Read more at location 2232

One could object here that the exalting of the sensory is merely a pedagogic means to restore the ideal order which is the rule of mind over body lost by the fall. However, this instrumentalist view of the sacraments suffers the same objection as an instrumentalist view of the Incarnation. In the latter case, for Aquinas, Christ became incarnate to redeem us, but this incarnation is a reality which eternally persists beyond our redemption, and in ontological dignity exceeds it. Likewise, if the body of the Incarnate God resides in bread and wine in order to feed us spiritually, this residing is eternally true—since bread and wine are not accidents of God, as nothing can be, and therefore they also are events which can never depart from him. Again, this residing exceeds in ontological dignity its occasion, and reserving of the Eucharistic elements, or the Corpus Christi processions which Aquinas helped to promote, appropriately express this. (One should note here also that we can be redeemed only by what is more than necessary for our redemption: that is, God and his presence.) So just as 'Our Lady is now Heaven's Queen', so also the humanly sensory is forever exalted in its inexhaustible depth above the human intelligence (although for the human intelligence). In consequence, since all that comes to pass participates in God whose truth it displays, and never expresses any arbitrary whim, this exaltation, like the hypostatic union, must disclose some hitherto unexpected dimension of the divine truth.Read more at location 2240

In the case of the hypostatic union, as we have seen, since God for Aquinas is both esse and tri-personal, he is open to the arrival of an event which causes something else to belong to him, not accidentally and not essentially, but rather as exhibiting precisely the same idiom of being; the same dance, in the same measure. But for Aquinas's theological metaphysics, this existential character of the Logos is the real, is the true concrete reality which upholds everything. Hence to be conjoined this way, is not to be weakly or metaphorically conjoined, nor merely conjoined by similar habitus (a position he specifically rejects), but also to be joined in substantive actuality. Here, as we saw, there is assumed into God an 'objective relationship' of the kind which a subject has to an instrument which becomes an organic part of himself.Read more at location 2252

Thus the participation of beings in esse involves something quite other than the external relation between beings, and is, for us, ultimately unthinkable. We have seen how Aquinas is driven to cite Dionysius to the effect that God somehow 'exists outside of himself' in the ecstasis of a lover. And we have further seen how in the Christological context this is deepened: it is because God is so utterly replete and self-sufficient that he can share without shadow of jealousy. Thus if what creation discloses of esse is that it somehow can exist outside of itself, what the ontological revision that is the hypostatic union discloses is that esse is in itself this ecstatic going outside itself. For divine esse is now shown to be such that a new thing can inhere in it, to be such that it can become entirely the suppositum of a creature outside itself,Read more at location 2264

For divine esse is now shown to be such that a new thing can inhere in it, to be such that it can become entirely the suppositum of a creature outside itself, yet without real addition to itself. This last negative safeguarding of divine aseity might seem to deny that divine esse is also divine event, but in fact it achieves the opposite. It denies that divine esse can become event, but affirms that it is event, since an event can entirely come to belong to it without adding anything new. The point must be that God already was, eminently, the new event. Of course, this eminent ground of eventuality in God is none other than the issuing forth of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, which the Incarnation and the instituting of the Church fully disclose once again to fallen humanity. Through this disclosure we come to understand that there can be a created exterior to God, because God's interior is self-exteriorization. We see this because we now have seen that a created exterior can be entirely assumed into the divine esse without abolition, and yet without addition to the Godhead.Read more at location 2269

But this regards only the ground in the Father's generating of the Son for his giving of the Creation. It reveals to us 'subjective relation' in God; it does not fully explain in what sense God can be eternally such as to be the subject of a new event which comes to belong to him, in the way that an organic instrument like a hand can come to belong to a person as something that is neither essential nor accidental. It does not fully explain how God becomes subject of this one-sided 'objective relation'. To understand this possibility, we have to grasp not only how esse is relational self-exteriorization, expressed as substantive relationality, but also how it somehow exceeds the contrast of given essence and accidental new additions. That is to say how the proper accident of the new organic instrument can come entirely to belong to God's being, and yet not add anything to this, nor be related to it.Read more at location 2274

in Aquinas, God is not really related to the Creation, he nonetheless knows perfectly the myriad ways in which he may be participated in by creatures. Therefore, it would seem that one might also say (though Aquinas does not say this), that God has eternally an eminent knowledge of the hypostatic union through knowledge of how a finite event may be absolutely conjoined to his esse. It would then follow that, although this only comes to be the case, God must, in his eternal nature, eminently know and therefore be, this coming to be the case.Read more at location 2285   • Delete this highlight Note: Best explanation of predestination I've ever seen

Christianity must imply an eternal divine-humanity: a God who was always also the God-Man. The mystery here must be that in order to foreordain the Incarnation as the remedy for sin, God always was the God-to-be-incarnate, already forgiving as giving. This need not imply any Hegelian becoming of God into his own through the alienation of evil, if it is understood that the to-be-incarnate in its contingency nonetheless entirely expresses what divine goodness in any case is. Only in this way can one make sense of the fact that, while the Incarnation is a contingent eventuality in time, since it is the unique event of the absolute inhering of time in eternity, from the eternal perspective God is eternally the God in whom a man inheres, just as he is eternally the God who has shared his being with the Creation.Read more at location 2289

Through the Incarnation, it is revealed that divine goodness is not simply subjective self-giving as displayed in creation (which, as we have seen, in principle, for Aquinas, discloses the Trinity—though only obscurely for fallen humanity), not just the substantive relational generating of the Logos which is the ground of creation, but also the constitution of the Logos through 'assumed additions' which are neither logically essential according to a given nature, nor merely willed accidents.Read more at location 2295

God is disclosed in the Incarnation as acting not merely by glance or speech, but also by direct touch issuing from spirit into matter (as in Michelangelo's Vatican ceiling). As somehow, in his very intelligence, this eternal touch, he is also eminently that moulding or shaping through which alone subjects communicate with each other, and together modify their shared objective medium to produce history. God, as esse, exceeds the contrast of being with becoming, and is eminently becoming.Read more at location 2304

And especially in becoming the subject of a human death, is God disclosed as touch. Since, as we have seen, for Aristotle and Aquinas, human intelligence is only inviolate as linked to absolutely vulnerable touch, it was appropriate that the Logos was only disclosed in time in and as a vulnerable body. And it was appropriate also that in dying (inevitably, because of sin), the exposure of the incarnate Logos to the touch of all should be revealed as the abiding intelligence able to resurrect the wounded surface of touch also to inviolable life.Read more at location 2308

It is these touching wounds, which, like the disciple Thomas, we touch, in order to touch for the first time God whose truth is to touch (meaning both to mould and to encounter). And since God is now revealed as touch, the new ontological exaltation of the sensory over the intellectual is no mere pedagogic means, but an appropriate new disclosure of the ultimately real. This exaltation, as we have seen, is undergirded by the priority of touch, whose direct mediation of the psychic ensures that this exaltation by no means betrays the understanding. It could always have been seen that touch as finely attuned sensation brought about understanding, but this is much more emphatically manifest after the Incarnation. Now, in order to understanding anything of divine truth (and so truth per se), we must touch divine physical manifestations, and we must elicit these through our Grafting of liturgical enactments.Read more at location 2312

When the supremely indeterminate pronoun 'this' is used to display, say, a diamond, the mind does not settle on conceiving it as a present apparent thing, but adds to it the ideas of a hard and sparkling body having a certain shape, besides connotations of wealth, beauty, romance and rarity.2 This qualification of our certainty regarding the meaning of words forms the basis of Arnauld's and Nicole's attack on the Calvinists' metaphorical interpretation of the Eucharist. For the Calvinists, they argue, assume in full nominalist fashion (probably influenced by the French Calvinist humanist Petrus Ramus), that the word 'this' establishes a firm attachment to a determinate referent, namely, in the case of Jesus's assertion, 'this is my body', a firm attachment to the bread. If one detaches the demonstrative pronoun from its obvious referent, as is the case, the Calvinists claim, when Jesus says 'this is my body', then it must be intended metaphorically. Arnauld and Nicole argue against this by drawing attention to the Calvinists' error of assuming that the demonstrative pronoun 'this' is anchored to a determinate specificity. To the contrary, they argue, specific application is only made possible in this case, because of the term's maximum of indeterminacy, its unlimited transferability. For the word 'this' always remains susceptible of further determinations and of being linked to other ideas.3Read more at location 2333

In addition, even when something apparently determinate is invoked by the pronoun 'this', that specificity is itself infinitely divisible and in consequence retains an open-ended and mysterious character. One might think, in the case of the bread to which the pronoun 'this' refers in Jesus's assertion, that there is at least some limit to the open-endedness of our mental compassing of the bread. But later in the Logic, again invoking Pascal, Arnauld and Nicole protest that even 'the smallest grain of wheat contains in itself a tiny world with all its parts—a sun, heavens, stars, planets, and an earth—with admirably precise proportions; that there are no parts of this grain that do not contain yet another proportional world'.4 Thus, even the most literal-seeming reference in fact preserves an infinity of mystery, even as it seems to command or delimit that extension.5Read more at location 2343

Pascal and his allies deployed aspects of the New Science against nominalism and the cruder variants of empiricism. And they brought into apologetic alignment the scene of experimentation with the scene of sacrificial offering, to the extent that both are read as exposing and releasing unexpected depths within seemingly brute matter. For the Port-Royal grammarians, therefore, there is a triple bond between the theory of physical matter, the question of how language operates and the theology of the Eucharist, and in particular the doctrine of transubstantiation. Echoing this threefold concern we will now demonstrate how discernment of the Body and Blood of Christ in the material species of bread and wine in the Eucharist, as interpreted by Aquinas, allows for—even demands—the greatest inexhaustibility of meaning, but at the same time, overcomes the problem of a sheer indeterminacy of sense, thereby allowing a basis for the possibility of 'truth'.Read more at location 2353

Thus, the Derridean sign relinquishes commitment to any specific epiphanies of meaning, or preferences for the lure of certain metaphors, and substitutes an universalized, autonomous and impersonal mathesis for language as such (as Gillian Rose rightly argued). For true difference and openness to the Other demand a sensitivity to the fact that some things are more alike than others, or are driven by the provocation of preference or desire which celebrates that difference all the better.Read more at location 2385

a cursory glance at the history of post-mediaeval Catholic theology, and its focus upon transubstantiation and 'real presence', might seem to suggest that the Eucharistic signs clearly privilege presence over absence. But if one looks further back to mediaeval theology, particularly that of Thomas Aquinas, and some of its later refractions, such as the work of the Port-Royal grammarians already mentioned (despite their possible Cartesian aspects), one can construct a different account of the theological signs of the Eucharist which—beyond the postmodern—more genuinely outwits the metaphysical dichotomies of presence and absence, life and death, continuity and discontinuity, and so forth. In order for such an account to be possible, however, one must understand the Eucharist, following the work of Henri de Lubac, as an essential action within the Church which constantly reproduces the Church, and not simply as either an isolated authoritative presence or merely illustrative symbol, which came, following the early modern period, to be the dominant readings.12Read more at location 2423

Briefly, the key to the transcending of the dichotomy of absence and presence in the Eucharist lies in the 'logic'—if one can here use such a term—of mystery which, according to patristic negotiations of the word musterion, implies a positive but not fetishizable arrival, in which signs essentially participate, but which they cannot exhaust; for that mystery arrives by virtue of a transcendent plenitude which perfectly integrates absence and presence. Thus a more positive account of the sign is suggested, for the sign here is neither emptily 'left behind' through postponement, nor is it the instrumental Ramist sign which secures the real in an artificial exactitude.Read more at location 2431

What this amounts to is an ontological coincidence of the mystical and the real, a coincidence which, as de Lubac shows, lies at the heart of mediaeval Eucharistic theology. If this coincidence becomes fissured, the Eucharistic signs perforce become either a matter of non-essential, illustrative signification which relies upon a non-participatory and conventional (if mimetic) similitude between the bread and the Body, and the wine and the Blood, or else the site of an extrinsicist miracle which stresses the alienness of bread from Body, and wine from Blood. These alternatives, in disconnecting the symbolic from the real, in an attempt to prioritize either one or the other, are both equally reducible to a synchronic mode of presence which fails to allow the sacramental mystery its full, temporally ecstatic potential within the action of ecclesia, namely, the continuing coming-to-be of the Church as Christ's body through an ingesting of this same body, which is at once a real and a symbolic consuming.Read more at location 2436

So, by stressing the ecclesial and relational context of the Eucharist, and its character as linguistic and significatory action—shaped by human hands—rather than extra-linguistic presence, one can start to overcome the logic of the secular Derridean sign.

For in a fallen world, we do not infallibly experience the unknown depth as a participated unknown which partially discloses its truth in the manifest; to the contrary, we experience it also as a rupture from God and ultimate truth or meaningfulness. Such hesitation is only overcome when we encounter, with the eyes of faith, the divine bridging of this rupture so that (here in the Eucharist) we see and taste a material surface as immediately conjoined to the infinite depth. Participation is, in this case, so entire that God as the participated truth is fully present, without lack, in the material bread and wine which participate. The situation heire is exactly parallel to that which was disclosed in Chapter Three in relation to the Incarnation. Because human reason no longer discerned God through its material sensing of the material world, God had to descend bodily into this world to reinstruct our reason. However, were it the case (as for some Protestant views), that the Incarnation is in no sense perpetuated through time, then, after Christ's ascension, one would revert to a priority of our rational remembering and understanding of Christ both for our salvation and our access to truth. Yet this appears unsatisfactory: first of all, because our fallenness persists and is still to be fully healed; secondly, because—as was explained in Chapter Three—the new priority of the sensory (especially of touch) amounts to an ontological revision whose 'fittingness' for our redemption nonetheless (beyond its mere means) discloses something new about God. Since God is not, for Aquinas, an arbitrary God, the 'convenient' means he newly elects, also further disclose how he eternally is.Read more at location 2481
