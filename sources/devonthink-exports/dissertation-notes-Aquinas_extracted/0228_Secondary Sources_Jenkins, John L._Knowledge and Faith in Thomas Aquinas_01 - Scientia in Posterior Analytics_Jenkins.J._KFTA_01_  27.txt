The second mode of priority of being "is considered according to the order of substance to accident."77 Aquinas explains: Because being is said in many ways and not univocally, it must be that all senses of being are referred back to one primary sense, according to which something is said to be being which is the per se existing subject of other beings. And because of this the first subject is said to be prior: hence substance is prior to accident.78
