# F. The sacraments are necessary for salvation.  because we are oriented towards a love of the creature, God must meet us in the creature.  That's why we need the incarnation.  God meets us where our mind is directed that he might turn us to himself,  Medicine applied to the diseased part. If an outward sign and words are not given, there is a problem of idolatry.  Grace is the cause of holiness.  And the sacrament is the means by which the holiness is applied.  The sacrament is the means by which we participate in the passion.  If Christ's Corss generated merit, we participate in it thru the Eucharist.
