# Grace enables us to see our sin and calls us to repent of our sin, deny the world, leads us to baptism.  In baptism, grace infuses into the soul the virtues (habits) of faith and hope.  Hope allows us to persevere towards the end of blessedness.  It directs our mind to the resurrection - to Christ's kingdom.  When we possess faith and hope, we possess a certain likeness to God.  Faith means that we know GOd not thru senses but thru revelation.  We view the world thru the context of the divine economy, we know the world as God does (we get a new lens unto  the world).  When we have this, we gain congruent Merit.
