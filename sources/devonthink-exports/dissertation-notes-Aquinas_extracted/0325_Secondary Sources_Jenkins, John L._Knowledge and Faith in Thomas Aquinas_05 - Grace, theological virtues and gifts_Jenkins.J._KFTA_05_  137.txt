Aquinas says here, as he does throughout his writings, that mundane goods are similitudes (similitudines) which participate (participare) in the divine good. Such terms clearly have Platonic and Neoplatonic roots, as Aquinas himself says in Summa theologiae 1.6.4 ("Whether all things are good by the divine good"). There he reviews what he understands as the Platonic view, that something said to be good is truly said to be such insofar as it stands in the proper participatory relationship to the exemplar, the per se good. He does not of course accept this view because it countenances subsistent, separate forms of natural things. Yet he accepts that God through His essence is good and plays a role played by Platonic exemplars: "From the first being and good [viz. God], which is such through its essence, everything can be said to be good and to be insofar as it participates in [the first being and good] in the manner of assimilation, albeit remotely and deficiently."26Read more at location 1893
