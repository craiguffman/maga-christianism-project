In this way the name "dog" may be said of a barking creature and of a heavenly body. Finally, something may be predicated analogically of different things that differ in definition but that are relevantly related to one and the same thing.'9 Aquinas illustrates this by using an example from Aristotle's Metaphysics IV 2.
