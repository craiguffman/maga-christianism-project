## Contents

1. Individual note files (.txt) organized in directories by figure
2. metadata.json - Complete metadata for all notes
3. index.md - A navigable master index of all notes
4. Figure-specific indexes in each figure's directory

## Using These Files

### For Your Book Research:
- Navigate to the directory of the key figure you're researching
- Upload individual .txt files to AI assistants as needed
- Upload the figure's index.md to provide context about available materials

### Working with AI Assistants:
- For specific inquiries about a figure, upload the figure's directory contents
- For broader research questions, use the master index.md to identify relevant files
- Start with smaller, focused uploads and add more context as needed

### Future Tana Integration:
- The metadata.json file contains all hierarchical information needed for a Tana import
- Each note includes its original path, creation date, and modification date
- Figure assignments can be used to organize notes in Tana workspaces
