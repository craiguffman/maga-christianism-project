L.xv.). Aquinas responds: \"although not all having faith fully understand the things which are proposed to be believed, they nevertheless understand that these things are to be believed and that one ought not deviate from them for any reason.\"108 The Gift of Understanding, which all the faithful enjoy, does not give any positive understanding of God's essence or of other things or events mentioned in the Creed. Rather, the faithful understand that these propositions are to be believed and that for no reason is one to deviate from adherence to them. Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02693",

Therefore faith does not seem to be in us from divine infusion.\"\"' Aquinas responds: \"Through scientia faith also is nourished in the manner of external persuasion, which comes to be from a certain sort of scientia. But the principle and proper cause of faith is that which moves internally to assent.\"114 That which moves internally is the infused, theological virtue and the promptings of the Holy Spirit moving someone with the Gifts; this is, Aquinas says, the principle and proper cause of faith.Read\u00a0more\u00a0at\u00a0location\u00a02719",

In making this choice Aquinas is working from the assumption that a sign is always a sign of something, and of something other than itself.  He knows that in the language of Augustine, the something signified is called res, and that this something is other than and beyond the familiarity of the sign....the reality signified in signs called sacraments is none other than Christ...the unique and universal principle of sanctification.   pp. 334-5",

    "text": "In the remaining articles of q.62 Aquinas uses the notion of instrumental causality that he has fashioned for understanding how sacraments act in God\u2019s giving of grace, to clarify some traditional language and to ground his theology firmly on the Bible and the patristic tradition.  Medieval theology, inspired by its reading of Augustine, held that sacrametns \u201ccontain grace\u201d and there is a virtus in them to give grace.  There were risky claims because they could make grace seem like a product to be stored and doled out.  Aquinas goes to some metaphysical lengths in a.3 and a.4 to show that his concept of instrumental causality allows one to maintain a true understanding of grace as a divine gift, while using this kind of metaphorical language about the sacraments.  In a.5 and a.6 he clinches his theory of instrumental causality both Christologically and biblically. He argues that the instrumentality of sacraments is a prolongation of the instrumentality of Christ\u2019s humanity.  The grace of the HS is given by God through Christ, the Word made flesh.  His humanity, joined to his divinity in hypostatic union, is an attached instrument of the divine; his sacraments are detached instruments by which the divine causality of grace, active in his humanity, reaches humans in place and time. p. 347",

    "text": "The idea that some sacraments give a \u201ccharacter\u201d to those who receive them, and that this character is something other than grace, was too solidly established in Latin theology for Aquinas to ignore it.  The postulate of a character had, to a large extent, grown out of the reception of Augustine\u2019s anti-Donatist reflections on the non-repetition of baptism.  The medieval theology on this topic also owes much to certain passages of The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius.  p. 349",
