    "text": "A third conflict was between Thomism and Scotism. Scotus was a Franciscan and Thomas a Dominican. Yet it was a new problem, also decisive for the modern world, involving the conflict between intellect and will as ultimate principles. For the Dominicans, for Thomism, that is, for the Aristotelian rationality which Thomas introduced into the church, the intellect is the predominant power. Man in man qua intellect.   p. 142",

    "text": "For the Augustinian line which leads to Duns Scotus will is the predominant power which makes man man, and God God. God is first of all will and only secondarily intellect. And will is the center of man\u2019s personality, and intellect is secondary. The world is originally created by will and is for this reason irrational and to be taken empirically. On a secondary level it is intellectually ordered. But this order is never final and cannot be taken in by us in deductive terms.   In the modern world this same conflict goes on, when thinkers like Henri Bergson and Brand Blanshard of Yale present contrasting systems in terms of the will and intellect.  p. 142",
