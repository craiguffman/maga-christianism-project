There he notes that where there is an order of causes, there is an order of effects which corresponds to it. Where we find such an order, Aquinas writes: Nor can the secondary cause [have any influence] through its own power on the effect of the primary cause, although it is an instrument of the primary cause with respect to that effect.

Elaborating Aquinas's example, let us consider the artisan who, not long before Aquinas came to Paris, carved the figure of Christ in the Last judgment scene above the central portal of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. His axe, when it meets with the stone with sufficient force, has the potency of chipping it. It does not, however, given just any force, have the potency to carve a figure of Christ in relief; for this it is necessary that a skilled stone-mason wield the axe. However, because the axe serves as the stone-mason's instrument it can be said, in some sense, that it carves the figure.
