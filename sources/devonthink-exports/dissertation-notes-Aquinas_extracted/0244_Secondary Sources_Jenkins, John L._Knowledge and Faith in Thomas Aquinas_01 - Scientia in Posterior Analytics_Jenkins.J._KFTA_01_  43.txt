The PA, then, implies that there must be an initial or first stage of inquiry devoted to these preparatory discoveries. In some scientiae, such as arithmetic or geometry, this first stage may not be problematic or involved, for the principles and concepts of these scientiae may be relatively readily grasped. In the natural scientiae, however, the natures and powers of things are often hidden, and can only be discovered through more accessible effects.107 In such cases, the inquirer may need to employ demonstrations quia in order to discover causes,108 as when one attempts to demonstrate that the planets are near because they do not twinkle.109 A subsequent second stage involves the construction of propter quid demonstrations, which proceed from principles which are true and meet the priority cluster of conditions. But, as we have seen, it is also required that the demonstrator and his demonstration meet the doxastic causality condition, and thus undergo a sort of cognitive re-structuring, so that his belief that something is a cause itself becomes the cause of (in the sense of epistemic ground of or reason for) his belief that something else is the effect. In certain scientiae, such as mathematics, our belief in the effect flows naturally from our belief in the cause. But in other scientiae, such as all the natural scientiae, we naturally know the effects prior to the cause. In such scientiae, then, the second stage will involve not only the construction of syllogisms, but a kind of re-arrangement in our doxastic structure, so that the causes, which were formerly less familiar, become more familiar and better known; and the effects, formerly better known, come to be believed on the grounds of our belief in the cause.
