# Wippel.J._CCA_04:  310

In like fashion an individual (Socrates) is said to participate in human being. In these cases a less extended intelligible content is said to participate in a more extended intelligible content either as a species in a genus or as an individual in a species. Because intelligible contents (rationes) are at issue, this kind of participation may be described as "logical." (2) So too (2a) a subject participates in an accident and (2b) matter participates in form. Both may be described as instances of participation because the forms in question, whether accidental or substantial, while not restricted to any given subject when considered in themselves, are now limited to this or that particular subject. Since in both (2a) and (2b) distinct principles of being are involved, and since in each case a real composition results (whether of substance and accident or of matter and form), each may be described as a "real" or "ontological" participation. (3) Finally, an effect is said to participate in its cause, especially when it is not equal to the power of its cause. Under this third kind of real or ontological participation Aquinas seems to place participation of beings in existence (esse), the case of greatest interest here.34 Read more at location 1260
