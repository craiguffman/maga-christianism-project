### Highlights

- Both men were amazed by the contradictions they observed in the same society, and even in the same scenes. In the United States, they found that the rule of law coexisted with savage violence. They discovered throughout America a broad equality of manners and deep inequality of wealth. Most of all, they were astonished by the coexistence of freedom with slavery, and equality with racism. “Surely it is a strange fact,” Beaumont wrote, “that there is so much bondage amid so much liberty.”4 ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=74))
- From the early nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, six generations of American scholars were mostly Whig historians of their nation. Their work tended to center on ideas of liberty and freedom, equal rights and republican self-government. Major themes were the triumph of those ideas and institutions over tyranny and slavery. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=78))
- One is that slavery, racism, and racial oppression in many forms have long been great and persistent evils in America and the world. Another is that vibrant traditions of freedom and liberty and the rule of law have long continued to be sources of enduring strength, especially in the United States, most of all in our own time.

- In public discourse during the twenty-first century, we have seen a growing disregard for truth, and a cultivated carelessness of fact and evidence. More extreme when these words were written in the years 2020 and 2021 are deliberate falsehoods, actively concocted and widely deployed in new forms of rhetoric and communication. And this is only one trend among many others, of willful contempt for truth and even for ideals of truthfulness in our world.

- They reckon that in 366 years, slaving vessels embarked about 12.5 million captives in Africa, and landed 10.7 million in the New World. A horrific discovery is a careful estimate that the Middle Passage took a toll on more than 1.8 million African lives. In ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=140))
- its data show that of approximately 10.7 million Africans who survived the Middle Passage in the Atlantic slave trade, about 4.8 million went to South America, 4.7 million to the Caribbean islands, 800,000 to Central America, and only about 400,000 to North America within the present boundaries of the United States.

- O’Malley’s findings have changed our understanding of early American slavery in an important way. Some American historians have long believed that many or even most slaves who came to the mainland colonies in North America had been “seasoned” in the Caribbean, or born and raised there, or were “Atlantic Creoles” who had been raised there and in other Atlantic places. There was some truth in these beliefs, during early years of the slave trade to North America. But overall, O’Malley found them to be very much mistaken. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=153))
- In his database of slaves shipped from the West Indies to North America, 92 percent were “new negroes” from Africa, who were quickly transshipped through West Indian ports to mainland colonies. Only about 8 percent were “seasoned” or “Creole” West Indian slaves.12 ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=157))
- This material shows that few “Creole” or “seasoned” slaves came to Louisiana from the West Indies, again with some important exceptions such as the large West Indian migration to Louisiana in 1809.13 ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=161))
- Taken together, these various databases tell us that about 458,000 slaves came by sea to mainland British North American colonies, mainly from African and West Indian ports. Of that total, more than 95 percent had been born in Africa.17 ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=178))
- The Atlantic slave trade, large as it was, included less than half of the entire foreign slave trade from Africa. Another 14 to 16 million slaves were taken north across the Sahara, and east to the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=200))
- For at least five thousand years, captives were carried from tropical Africa to Mediterranean and Mesopotamian regions. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=202))
- This common pattern of diversity in African origins was of critical importance in every American region. Its primary effect was to create a mixture of African cultures, skills, material systems, and religious beliefs. A leading result was a stimulus to cultural creativity among Africans in many parts of North America and every major region. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=273))
- New England’s Great Migration of twenty thousand Puritans and others (1629–40) introduced distinctive ideas of ordered freedom, mainly as rights of belonging to communities of free people. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=308))
- Virginia’s great migrations came in the mid-seventeenth century (ca. 1640–76). They were more than double the size of New England’s Great Migration, and very different in social composition. The flow to Virginia and southern Maryland brought a small elite of high-born gentry, a minority of yeoman farmers, and many unfree servants. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=309))
- More than 75 percent of British migrants to colonial Virginia came to America as bound servants, compared with less than 25 percent to New England. Virginia’s leaders shared ideas of hegemonic liberty as an idea of rank, which gave many rights to planters, some rights to yeomen, a few rights to servants, and nearly no rights to slaves. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=311))
- Pennsylvania’s great Quaker migration (1675–1715) was yet another story. It brought a unique idea of reciprocal liberty and freedom, derived from Quaker preaching, founded on the Four Gospels and the Golden Rule, and inspired by the teaching of Jesus, that “what you do for the least of my brethren you do for me.” ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=315))
- The last, longest, and largest British colonial migration (1715–75) came mainly from the borderlands of northern England, the lowlands of Scotland, the marches of Wales, the north of Ireland, and other Irish counties. Some of them are called Scots-Irish. Throughout those contested regions, rival rulers had inflicted misery and violence on the inhabitants for a thousand years. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=317))
- After the Act of Union in 1707, the English Parliament increased its hegemony. Many emigrants responded by moving to the American backcountry, where they introduced a distinctive idea of natural liberty as the right to be left alone, with as little government as possible, which still prevails in some interior parts of the United States. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=320))
- These regional patterns are still evident today. In 2017, they were put to a genomic test in a large study by geneticists and genealogists on the present population of North America. They did a “fine-scale cluster analysis” of 770,000 genomes among individual American families of European origin who had at least three generations of ancestors in what is now the United States. The linkages in this inquiry comprised 500 million genetic connections, in the estimates of its authors. The results yielded a pattern of five major genomic clusters in the United States. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=330))
- They also observed that these clusters correlate with the four major colonial migrations as reported from historical sources in Albion’s Seed. A fifth major cluster was in coastal Carolina, which was not part of Albion’s Seed because a large majority of its population was African in origin. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=334))
- In every American region, Africans both slave and free played a vital role in these processes. By their presence, and still more by their acts and choices, they made a difference in American history. They acted with purpose and resolve to change the ways that free and open systems worked in what is now the United States. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=455))
- In that ongoing process, African people who came mostly in slavery made America more open and more free, in a long process that began with their earliest arrivals, and continues among their descendants in our own time. These many acts and consequences might be understood as among the most dynamic and most enduring African gifts to America and the world.

- To study these passages is to discover that Coffe Slocum brought together several moral traditions in his thinking. Some of them derived from Puritan and Quaker beliefs that Max Weber collectively called the Protestant ethic. These were ethics of serving God in one’s calling by getting and keeping, and doing well in the world. Another part of Puritan and Quaker ethics (which Weber largely missed) was about giving to others, and “doing good to all.” Coffe Slocum engaged all of these ideas in his thinking. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=554))
- At the same time, he also engaged Fante and Asante ethics of right conduct that he had learned as an African child. Today, in Ghana’s modern universities, a large literature has developed on “Akan Ethics,” which have deep roots in West Africa and are increasingly studied by moral philosophers through the world. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=558))
- In revealed religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, ethical systems are perceived as a product of divine revelation, in the form of sacred texts. Akan moral beliefs had another foundation. They centered on an idea of ethics as derived from the needs and customs of a people and were reinforced by the gods rather than dictated by them. Kwame Gyekye observes that “rather than regarding African ethics as religious, it would be more correct to regard African religions as ethical.” ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0984GXXFX&location=562))
- The moral passages in Coffe Slocum’s journals were not examples of static African “survivals,” or of rote borrowing from Puritan and Quaker beliefs. They were something new in the world—another ethic that emerged when African and European traditions met in the mind of a very bright and able Akan-speaking freedman in eighteenth-century New England.
