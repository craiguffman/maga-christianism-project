### Highlights

- Today, this religious tradition is often forgotten, or repressed, with freedom struggles described as a part of the (ostensibly secular) black radical tradition. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=168))
- a dramatic shift in the religious ideas and languages that are legible to a broad public audience. Religion has become more individualized, many staid religious institutions have declined in their membership and moral influence, and intellectual elites have often become invested in a deep secularism. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=170))
- Today, it is necessary to ask: How might we understand the black radical tradition as a black religious radical tradition—or a black Christian radical tradition? ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=174))
- Because of the importance of Christianity in shaping American culture and in shaping Americans (whether they admit it or not), retrieving that world-defying potential of Christianity holds the possibility of critical leverage for seeing the world otherwise—and seeing another world absent injustice. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=182))
- But most importantly, God is black. This was the provocation of Albert Cleage and James Cone, the first formalizers of black theology, in the 1960s, and, for Christians, it should be straightforwardly true. God identifies with the most marginalized, those who suffer from systemic injustice. In twenty-first-century America, those are blacks, so that is where God is to be found, with all this claim implies. To understand Christian ethics, studying the practices of black communities, particularly black communities struggling against injustice, is more likely to yield insights than studying the works of European theologians alone. An even higher yield will come when that study of black struggle is accompanied by participation in struggle. In the formulation of black theologians, this is the imperative to become black.

- Indeed, what is at stake is the belief that no lives are disposable, that there is something about human life that deserves reverence, not calculation. Human life has inherent worth and dignity, or, in a more theological idiom, sacredness—it images and shelters the divine.

- The police officer is charged with protecting sacred (white) life by means of calculating and neutralizing threats from disposable (black) life. As disposable, as object of calculation, black life is stripped of spirit. At the extreme, what remains is only the black body, object of repulsion and attraction, of fantasy, transformed into a demon in the mind of Officer Wilson, warehoused in prisons, executed by lethal injection or by environmental racism or by inadequate health care. What remains is flesh without feeling, incapable of being loved by others, let alone loving itself, let alone loving the world that so humiliates ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=204))
- This is the tragic gift that black folks bring to the world, a reminder that to be human is to struggle against the powers that be, against the wisdom of the world, at once personally and collectively. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=214))

- In both, this term indicates that the racial oppression faced by blacks in America (and, on some accounts, globally) is more than can be expressed by a collection of empirical evidence. Housing and employment discrimination, enormous wealth inequities, police harassment, disproportionate incarceration—these are all realities of black American life, but they are symptoms of a chronic ailment. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=220))
- Anti-blackness is the key term employed in struggles for racial justice today. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=226))

- It can refer to any set of beliefs or practices that disadvantages one race more than another. Conversations about racism can tend, therefore, to remain at an unhelpful level of abstraction. They can also be easily sidetracked by appeals to so-called reverse racism. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=228))

- despite many efforts to define racism as a structural evil, many people still associate it with prejudice on the part of individuals, of racists. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=230))
- In contrast, the term anti-blackness draws particular attention to harms done to black people, and it points to both the interpersonal and structural dimensions of these harms. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=231))
- Others—of particular interest in the present context—tell an even longer history of anti-blackness, one in which anti-blackness is a transformation of the anti-Indian cultural metaphysics developed during colonialism, itself a transformation of the anti-Jewish logics developed in the early days of Christianity.8 In other words, the structure of anti-blackness is really a new form of the theological problem of anti-Judaism, or supersessionism. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=236))
- If the problem is fundamentally about theology infected by supersessionist heresy, then fixing theology should fix anti-blackness, but of course that is too simple. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=243))
- Why focus on anti-blackness instead of white privilege or white supremacy? ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=248))

- The double negative—resisting anti-blackness—allows the meaning of black life to remain open-ended. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=265))
- The movement-mobilizing power of anti-blackness is arguably much stronger than that of diversity, inclusion, or multiculturalism. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=269))

- There can be no justice in the celebration of multiple ways of being human unless and until there is also firm commitment to overcome the negations of black life that are rampant today. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=272))

- Brown Douglas makes a similar point about Anglo-Saxon civil religion of the United States, which has been historically blended with and misconstrued as Christianity. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=291))
- anti-blackness contradicts the basic tenet of theological anthropology that all persons are created in the image of God and have rights and dignity on that basis, regardless of their race. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=308))
- despite the ubiquity of religion in Baldwin's own thought, and the religious source of Baldwin's title. Indeed, the alteration to the title in the twenty-first-century volume marks its secularization. The climax of Baldwin's book is a citation of a slave spiritual: “God gave Noah the rainbow sign / No more water, the fire next time”—itself a paraphrase of 2 Peter 3:6-7. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=332))
- Baldwin forced his readers to choose: accept the ways of the world or have faith that another world is possible. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B076H5XRVQ&location=339))
