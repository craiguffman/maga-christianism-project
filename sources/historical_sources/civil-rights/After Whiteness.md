### Highlights

- What exactly is the distortion in formation? It will take time for me to show you this distortion and its strong connection to the crisis of decline in theological education. It is a distortion that forms between two things. On one side there is an image of an educated person that propels the curricular, pedagogical, and formational energies of Western education, and especially theological education. That image is of a white self-sufficient man, his self-sufficiency defined by possession, control, and mastery.1 ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089LPGXF1&location=148))
- On the other side, many people respond to that image by promoting a homogeneity that aims toward a cultural nationalism. This quest for a cultural nationalism or cultural sovereignty inadvertently keeps us captured in the formational energies of white self-sufficient masculinity.

- Theological education in the West was born in white hegemony and homogeneity, and it continues to baptize homogeneity, making it holy and right and efficient—when it is none of these things. “Hegemony” and “homogeneity” are words that mean control and sameness, a control that aims for sameness and a sameness that imagines control. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089LPGXF1&location=154))
- Crudely put, theological education vacillates between a pedagogical imagination calibrated to forming white self-sufficient men and a related pedagogical imagination calibrated to forming a Christian racial and cultural homogeneity that yet performs the nationalist vision of that same white self-sufficient man. Theological education, however, is simply living out in microcosm the wider problem that plagues Western education.

- Caught in the powerful currents of a history that moves through us, we inhabit a social world constricted through whiteness that has left us with limited options for imagining how we might be with each other. That social world, to be clear, does not need the presence of peoples of European descent to be active, strong, and destructive. It only needs desire deformed by colonialist urges to control bodies, aimed toward their objectification and exploitation. The distorted erotic power that fuels that world must be freed from its captivity to whiteness and turned back toward its source in divine desire.

- The crowd surrounding Jesus gathers in the desire of God. The crowd gathers, and this is already on the way to being good news. The crowd is not Christian, but the gathering is in Christ. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089LPGXF1&location=2337))
