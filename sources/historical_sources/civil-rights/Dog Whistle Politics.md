### Highlights

- It explains popular enthusiasm for policies injuring the middle class in terms of “dog whistle politics”: coded racial appeals that carefully manipulate hostility toward nonwhites. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=56))
- In the last 50 years, dog whistle politics has driven broad swaths of white voters to adopt a self-defeating hostility toward government, and in the process has remade the very nature of race and racism. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=60))
- would say the same regarding the approach to race Obama seemed to cultivate as a student—that one can heal racial divisions by standing apart from racial conflict, simply letting race play itself out. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=77))
- Dog Whistle Politics explains how politicians backed by concentrated wealth manipulate racial appeals to win elections and also to win support for regressive policies that help corporations and the super-rich, and in the process wreck the middle class. The book lays out the details. For now, though, the bottom line is that Professor Bell was correct: racism is not disappearing, it’s adapting. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=122))
- here’s the crucial point—nonwhites have not been the only victims of the recent slide. Instead, racism has been harnessed to a rightwing politics that bankrupts the middle class writ large. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=129))
- Like most, I had been conditioned to think of racism as hatred, and racists as pathologically disturbed individuals. To be sure, sadistic racists exist, and racism is frequently bound up with the emotional heat of fear and hatred. But as I began to intuit while hitchhiking through the landscape of apartheid, most racists are good people. That bears emphasizing, since it runs so profoundly contrary to the dominant conception. Even the farmer who killed another human being for the petty act of poaching, I came to understand, was not a homicidal lunatic but a complex person capable of both brutal violence and real generosity.

- These apologies at once confess to racial pandering and also implicitly promise to sin no more. This is a promise that the GOP will struggle to fulfill, for this party is now essentially defined by race: it is almost exclusively supported by and composed of whites. In the 2012 presidential election, 88 percent of the voters who pulled the lever for the GOP candidate were white.3 That means that whites made up roughly nine out of every ten persons who threw in with Mitt Romney. Even more startling, among state-level elected Republican officials nationwide, 98 percent are white.4 Notwithstanding some prominent minority faces pushed to the fore to suggest otherwise, this is a party of white persons. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=169))
- From conservatives, there’s the occasional mea culpa, but much more typically there’s a firm insistence that the GOP does not notice race, followed by the outraged retort that any suggestion otherwise is not only unfounded but a contemptible playing of the race card. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=174))
- Running on racial appeals, the right has promised to protect supposedly embattled whites, when in reality it has largely harnessed government to the interests of the very affluent. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=197))
- As we will explore, many whites vote Republican out of racial anxiety and, as members of the broad middle, lose out when they do so. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=205))
- How has the GOP managed to elicit racial loyalty despite a national revulsion toward racism? The answer lies in the GOP’s use of coded language. Its racial entreaties operate like a dog whistle—a metaphor that pushes us to recognize that modern racial pandering always operates on two levels: inaudible and easily denied in one range, yet stimulating strong reactions in another. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=214))
- In general, using a dog whistle simply means speaking in code to a target audience. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=225))
- Dog whistling has no particular political valence, occurring on the right and left, nor is it especially uncommon or troubling in and of itself. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=228))
- Throughout this book, I use “dog whistle politics” to mean, more narrowly, coded talk centered on race; while the term could encompass clandestine solicitations on any number of bases, here it refers to racial appeals. Beyond emphasizing race, racial dog whistle politics diverges from the more general practice because the hidden message it seeks to transmit violates a strong moral consensus. The impetus to speak in code reflects more than the concern that many voters do not embrace the target audience’s passions. Rather, the substance of the appeal runs counter to national values supporting equality and opposing racism. Those blowing a racial dog whistle know full well that they would be broadly condemned if understood as appealing for racial solidarity among whites. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=231))
- This makes racial dog whistling a more complicated phenomenon than other sorts of surreptitious politics. It involves, as we shall see, three basic moves: a punch that jabs race into the conversation through thinly veiled references to threatening nonwhites, for instance to welfare cheats or illegal aliens; a parry that slaps away charges of racial pandering, often by emphasizing the lack of any direct reference to a racial group or any use of an epithet; and finally a kick that savages the critic for opportunistically alleging racial victimization. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=236))
- Dog whistle entreaties often hide racism even from those in whom it triggers strong reactions. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=253))
- dog whistling underlies efforts to dismantle government commitments essential to supporting a vibrant and growing middle class. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=256))
- Throughout this book, I use “middle class” in a manner inspired by the New Deal and its conception of those it sought to help: as a term that encompasses persons in the broad economic middle as well as those in poverty struggling to gain economic security. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=262))
- The New Deal itself was originally limited largely to whites, until under pressure from the growing number of black voters outside the South as well as the burgeoning civil rights movement, beginning in the 1960s the Democratic Party began to fold nonwhites into the broad middle that government sought to help.9 But sensing an opportunity, Republicans moved in the opposite direction: they began to stoke hostility toward integration in schools and neighborhoods and to enflame resentment toward government initiatives to help nonwhites move into the middle class. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=265))
- also worked to turn whites against liberal government. New Deal opponents had long repeated a tired mantra: the undeserving poor abuse government help, robbing hardworking taxpayers. This tale had little traction when whites saw themselves as the beneficiaries of government help, but once convinced that government aimed to shower minorities with their hard-earned tax dollars, this suddenly propelled many whites to reject liberalism. Attacks on integration quickly segued into broadsides against an activist state that funded welfare, schooling, job training programs, and so forth. Hostility toward the New Deal surged among whites—once it came to be seen as a repudiation of lazy, threatening nonwhites and the big government that coddled them. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=270))
- As it has for the last five decades, casting whites as victims of an activist government that rains gifts on grasping minorities remains the most potent rhetoric available to conservatives. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=282))
- dog whistle politics centrally involves using race to attack liberal government. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=332))
- Yet even tempered references to whites may generate discomfort: the term seems to treat as a monolith a group that comprises tens of millions of unique individuals who relate to their racial identity in innumerable, complicated ways. Thus, to be absolutely clear, in repeatedly talking about whites (and nonwhites) in the aggregate, I do not mean to imply a false uniformity that treats all group members as if they hold an identical relationship to race. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=362))
- In Dog Whistle Politics, we are principally concerned with voters who respond to appeals directed to their sense of themselves as white persons. Even as we take care to respect the complicacy of this phenomenon, we can hardly move forward without treating white identity as socially meaningful. “White” in this book serves as a necessary shorthand for a colossally powerful social entanglement. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=367))
- Colorblindness answers by opportunistically switching to another understanding of race, frequently dropping race-as-blood to talk about racial groups as ethnicities marked by distinct cultures. To be clear, conservatives do not expressly equate ethnicity and race; indeed, when pushed, they revert to the notion that race is only a matter of superficial biology, and so, deny that racial groups can be defined by distinct cultures. Yet that is only when challenged; otherwise, conservatives routinely employ ethnic terms as a coded way to talk about racial groups and their supposedly incompatible behaviors and beliefs. ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=1999))
- Ethnicity provides a basis for blaming minorities for their inferior positions, since it faults their supposedly defective cultures; simultaneously, it exonerates whites, since racism is no longer to blame for inequality. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=2005))
- What had been “races” supposedly divided by deep natural differences now became “ethnicities” distinguished only by cultural diversity. ([Location 2024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=2024))
- First, Obama must both articulate and govern according to a positive liberal vision. Either one, without the other, is insufficient. A message without action comes across as politics as usual, while there’s also a risk to acting without an accompanying story. Too often, liberals craft programs that provide much-needed assistance but hide government’s helping hand, facilitating later attacks by conservatives seeking to convince voters that liberal programs do nothing for them. ([Location 4432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=4432))
- But by the same token, liberals cannot shy from identifying self-interested billionaires and giant corporations that attempt to distort the democratic process to serve their own narrow interests. Teddy Roosevelt, the great capitalist crusader for progressive government, captured this spirit when lambasting “malefactors of great wealth.” Wealth was not their sin. Far from it, the patricians—like Roosevelt himself—had a role to play in contributing to society. But vast inequalities corrode social solidarity, and we must warn against the robber barons—individuals as well as corporations—that use their power and influence to promote only their own interests, with no regard for the damage they do to the rest of us. ([Location 4448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=4448))
- Yet the research is clear that putting race front and center in voters’ consciousness, rather than leaving it operating in the background, helps reduce the power of coded racial appeals.30 Beyond the research, recent history shows that by staying silent, liberals do not evade race-baiting but merely cede the public square to racial demagogues and their coded trumpeting about race and liberal governance. ([Location 4461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=4461))
- But if the goal is rebuilding a liberal coalition, the word “racism” must be used. The term carries so much power because at root it is a moral indictment: to call something racism is to say it is wrong and society must come together to change it. It’s this very power that has made “racism” an object of such fierce struggle over the last half century. ([Location 4512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=4512))
- colorblindness also operates as an etiquette that treats talking about race as impolite and even racist. Those who discuss racism are accused of being the real racists—again, as if pulling a fire alarm means one set the fire, or dialing 911 means one committed the crime. Refusing to be silenced, to defeat dog whistle racism and restore government to the side of the middle class will require as many of us as possible to go ahead and sound that alarm. ([Location 4600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GHJNSMU&location=4600))
- The ultimate goal is not to reassemble a winning Democratic majority. Rather, the goal is to restore a political consensus that sees government not as a handmaiden to mooching nonwhites, but as a powerful tool for promoting liberty and opportunity for all.
