### Highlights

- The way Hispanic people were depicted surprised me because the language seemed unchanged from the rhetoric of more than a decade earlier. The subtexts and implications were the same—there was little recognition of a long, shared past, and instead the talk was of border-jumpers, lack of documentation, and the use of “Mexican” as shorthand for “illegal immigrant.” ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=106))
- It was jarring because the reality of who was coming to the United States had long been more complex, not least because plenty of immigrants and citizens have roots in all the distinct nations of Latin America. The simmering anxieties about the Spanish-speaking population that such rhetoric exposed exploded in the 2016 presidential race, during which chants of “build that wall” between the United States and Mexico could be heard at campaign rallies for Donald Trump. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=109))
- why had I—and other Italian-Americans—been able to transcend this but not those with Hispanic names? ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=127))

- The poet Walt Whitman, writing in 1883 to decline an invitation to speak at the anniversary of the founding of Santa Fe, meditated on the country’s Spanish past. “We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify them,” he wrote. “Thus far, impressed by New England writers and schoolmasters, we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our United States have been fashioned from the British Islands only, and essentially form a second England only—which is a great mistake.” ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=139))
- Or, in the more graphic description of the scholar and poet Gloria Anzaldúa, the border is “una herida abierta”—an open wound—and a place set up “to distinguish us from them.” ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=173))
- Felipe Fernández-Armesto’s more recent assessment that the United States “is—and has to be—a Latin American country.”6 Thinking about the United States in this way can help make sense of a past that goes far beyond the boundary markers at the United States–Mexico border and instead focuses on the longer hemispheric connections, from Canada to the tip of Chile. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=184))
- The term “Hispanic” is being employed here in part to express a sense of continuity, as the word reaches back to the Roman past (Hispania) and forward to the census-taking present. It is at once a panethnic label—the worlds of Europeans, Africans, Asians, and Amerindians were all transformed by the arrival of the Spanish in the Americas— ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=188))
- For the most part, people from Latin American countries identify themselves by their nation of birth: Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan. As soon as they come to the United States, they often find themselves categorized as Hispanic or Latino/a, or the more inclusive Latinx.** ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=193))
- Even the assumption that people in Latin America are Spanish-speakers is misplaced, as there are a wide variety of Amerindian languages spoken across the continent. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=196))
- Yet for those of Spanish-American origin who have long been in the United States, a reverse question could be asked: at what point are you allowed to not be Hispanic? People who are identified by the census as “Hispanic” might have a grandparent who arrived from Mexico or Cuba two generations ago, or might speak only a smattering of Spanish, but this is often met with an expectation that as recent arrivals they should be knowledgeable about their “heritage” and “traditions,” which, by implication, are not Anglo-American. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=199))
- The United States is now second only to Mexico in the number of its Spanish-speakers, with 41 million speakers and nearly 12 million who say they are bilingual.* ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=209))
- In this seemingly endless obsession with physiognomy, a toxic hangover from slavery and Jim Crow, is “Hispanic” just another way of saying “not white”? Although scientific notions of “race” have been discredited, as a social force it continues to order society, placing hierarchies in everything from the organization of labor to the distribution of rights. Creating “whiteness” and granting access to it were—and remain—ways to create power and exert social control. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=215))
- Race, at its most basic level, as sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant point out, is a way of “making up people.” To them, the social development of the United States had been shaped by what they call “racialization,” a process by which “racial meaning” is extended to “a previously racially unclassified relationship, social practice or group,” in this case, Hispanic people. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=221))
- Even seemingly positive trends toward multiculturalism, or in Mexico mestizaje, have led to criticism that such color blindness continues to obscure structural inequalities and ongoing racism. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=229))
- These different whitenesses sometimes do not translate, however, and many people find they go from being white in their home nation to being “Hispanic” or “brown” in the United States. “Brown confuses,” Richard Rodriguez wrote in his memoir about race. “Brown forms at the border of contradiction,” though with its mixture of Indian, African, and European, to Rodriguez brown is the true “founding palette.” ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=231))
- Equally muddied is the issue of “ethnicity,” which overlaps with markers such as language or food. There is no clear consensus on where Hispanic people lie on this spectrum, or even how to pinpoint ethnicity. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=235))
- To the historian Alan Gallay, an ethnic identity “becomes apparent only when people are faced with an external threat that draws them together,” a conclusion drawn from his research on Native Americans in the seventeenth century. For Gallay, ethnicity is “relational and situational” and thus there can be no “pure” ethnicities because even elements like religion or language are mutable. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=236))
- In the context of Mexican-Americans, the historian George J. Sánchez has described ethnicity as being “not a fixed set of customs surviving from life in Mexico, but rather a collective identity that emerged from daily experience in the United States.” ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=240))
- Today, ethnicity remains as puzzling as race, and it, too, is often shaped by stereotypes. Are you still “Hispanic” if you speak only English, are Protestant, and don’t care for tacos? ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=245))
- Language, race, and ethnicity also overlap with the question of citizenship, and so inform one of the key underlying issues: belonging. This can lead to what the legal historian Mae Ngai has called “alien citizens,” which she defined as “persons who are American citizens by virtue of their birth in the United States but who are presumed to be foreign by the mainstream of American culture and, at times, by the state.” To Ngai, a type of foreignness can exist in one’s own homeland, where one group, such as Hispanics, is deemed “illegitimate, criminal, and unassimilable.” Despite being citizens, they are told they don’t belong. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=246))
- Like whiteness, being “American” was designed at some level to be exclusionary; it was built on Anglo and northern European ancestry, Protestantism, and, for the most part, speaking English. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=263))
- By the nineteenth century, during a time of widespread Eastern and southern European immigration, southern Mediterraneans such as Italians and Greeks were considered not quite “white.” Yet by the early twentieth century, Mexican laborers, who were in demand, were allowed, up to a point, to be “white.” White, it appears, was a gray area. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=269))
- Italians are now considered white, but Mexicans usually are not. Like many of the categories that are bandied about—race, ethnicity, black, white, Latino—“American” is a social construction, supported by a scaffolding of historical precedent, tradition, legal structures, and government legislation. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=271))
- Norte is organized chronologically, with four overlapping sections. The first starts with the arrival of the Spanish in North America. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=286))
- From there, the book moves into a second section, the independence period, as Spain’s colonies became nations, looking at the relationship of the young United States with these new republics—especially Mexico—throughout the nineteenth century. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=289))
- The third part looks at the early decades of the twentieth century, especially immigration, as Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans arrived in significant numbers. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=292))
- This overlaps with the final section, which considers the changes in wider public attitudes and ideas about immigration after the Second World War—in which Hispanic-Americans played an important part—and the Cuban Revolution, the onset of NAFTA, and the current political climate. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=294))
- The Genoese navigator presented his plan for an expedition to the east to the powerful monarchs of Castile and Aragon, Isabel and Fernando, at an opportune moment. They had just finished a drive in Andalusia to expel what was left of the Moorish kingdoms from the Iberian Peninsula, and their victory in Granada in early 1492 ended the centuries-long Muslim era in Spain. The monarchs were buoyed by this triumph, and also interested in possible new sources of revenue to cover their costs. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=300))
- he was thousands of miles off in his calculations. Rather than arriving in Japan, he spotted the Bahamas in October 1492. His initial encounter with the people there did not inspire him to linger—the sandy isle did not match his expectations of great eastern cities—and so his three ships pushed on, landing on Quisqueya. He claimed it for the crown, and renamed it Española (also called Hispaniola, today’s Dominican Republic and Haiti). ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=306))
- Columbus wanted to establish a colony and implement what became known as the encomienda.26 This entitled the leaders of a successful expedition who had been given a grant, known as encomenderos, the right to collect tribute from the vanquished. In the case of Hispaniola, this required making deals or using force to exact tribute from the indigenous chiefs, whom the Spanish called caciques. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=315))
- In 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued the bull Inter Caetera, which outlined this spiritual dimension, stipulating that on these voyages to non-Christian lands there must be “worthy, God-fearing, learned, skilled, and experienced men, in order to instruct the aforesaid inhabitants and residents in the Catholic faith.”28 The document also gave Spain and Portugal spheres of influence, and these demarcations were confirmed in 1494 by the Treaty of Tordesillas, which put the limit of the Portuguese boundary at 370 leagues (around 1,185 nautical miles) west of the Cape Verde Islands. Spain was given everything to the west of that line, which was the vast majority of the American landmass, with only the easternmost part of Brazil falling to the Portuguese. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=327))
- While the term “Spanish” is used as shorthand to describe Columbus’s men, they were anything but; calling them Europeans—or at least Mediterraneans—is more accurate. Columbus, although long associated with Spain, had grown up in Genoa and spent much of his seafaring life sailing out of Portugal. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=337))
- The geographical boundaries of the Iberian Peninsula contained a broad mix of people, many of whom, including Catalans, Basques, and Galicians, as well as the Portuguese, would become part of the imperial project in the New World. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=339))
- Spanish, as an identity, did not exist in 1492. It developed over time, as crowns and kingdoms consolidated. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=341))
- Part of what it meant to be a Spanish subject was forged in the colonies of the growing empire, as Catholicism and the use of Castilian (rather than other languages, such as Basque or Catalan) became integral to that identity. Also, within the space of Columbus’s four voyages between 1492 and 1502, Spanish and indigenous people began to mix sexually, by desire, force, or pragmatism, and a group of people known as mestizos were born, blending together these worlds. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=344))
- Columbus died in Spain in 1506, clinging until the end to the belief that he had found the east, and never acknowledging what he had discovered. Perhaps this helps explain how it was the name of the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci that began to appear on European maps. Vespucci, who explored in the late 1490s, challenged Columbus’s claims. He also coined the phrase “New World” in his pamphlet Mundus Novus, in which he claimed there was undiscovered territory south of the equator.33 His discoveries informed the 1507 map Universalis Cosmographia, attributed to the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, which labeled the landmass across the southern Atlantic “America.” ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=352))
- There is a long and heated debate about nomenclatures, with Hispanic falling out of favor. There has been some criticism of the word “Hispanic,” the most serious being that it is exclusionary because it leaves out people of African, Asian, and indigenous origin. At the same time some people think it covers anyone with roots in a Spanish-speaking nation. Interestingly, a 2017 book, Keywords for Latina/o Studies, which has sixty-three short essays about a single term, omits the word “Hispanic” altogether, with perhaps the closest term being a chapter on Latinidad/es, though as this essay’s author points out, this word, too, has come under fire for homogenizing the diversity of an entire hemisphere. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=362))
- the Spanish spotted this bit of land in 1521, named it Santa Elena in 1526, and fought over it against the French, who arrived three decades later. Parris Island, where the Broad and Beaufort Rivers converge, is surrounded by tidal creeks, mosquitoes, and the dense, wet smell of alluvial mud. It seems an unlikely location to begin the story of the Spanish in North America, and in some ways it was. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=383))
- The Spanish path to Santa Elena can be traced from Spain to Hispaniola, bouncing from island to island in the Caribbean, until it reaches Veracruz, Mexico. By the early 1500s, three men whose lives would be bound up with the creation of Spain’s American empire had arrived in Hispaniola: Bartolomé de Las Casas, in 1502; Hernando Cortés, in 1504; and Juan Ponce de León, who had been part of Columbus’s second voyage in 1493. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=386))
- Ponce’s career had an auspicious start. As a young man in Spain, where he was born in the Valladolid province sometime around 1474, he participated in the successful campaign against the Moors in Granada before joining Columbus. From there he became involved in the suppression of an indigenous uprising on Hispaniola, in Higüey in 1504, for which he was rewarded by being put in charge of the eastern territory. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=392))
- They arrived in April 1513 around the time of the Easter feast of flowers, Pascua Florida, so Ponce named the spot La Florida. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=412))
- Some historians have suggested that Amerindians from Cuba who had fled during the Spanish colonization of that island in 1511 went to Florida, so Ponce and his men were not so foreign after all—the native peoples of Florida had been warned. Some of the earliest, albeit secondary, accounts of indigenous-European encounters in Florida back this up, claiming there were Native Americans who could speak Spanish. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=421))
- Although Queen Isabel had attempted to temper the treatment of the Amerindians, considering them vassals who could not be enslaved, violence was rife. Loopholes in the decrees the crown had issued could be exploited, not least the enslavement of anyone who resisted conversion to Christianity. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=445))
- Around 1517, Governor Velázquez sent expeditions from Cuba to the nearby Yucatán Peninsula, to the west of the island. One party went ashore, in part to explore but also to find water, and they met the Maya who lived there. Although the Spanish might have been hoping to enslave some of them, the resulting encounter led to the death of fifty Spaniards and the capture of two. A second expedition landed on Cozumel, an island off the coast of the Yucatán, in 1518, with around two hundred men. Although they were attacked, they continued exploring the coast before returning to Cuba to report what they had seen.19 It appeared to Velázquez that this land might be suitable for settlement, so he wrote to the crown to obtain the necessary permission.20 ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=457))
- In 1519, Velázquez ordered Cortés to further explore the Yucatán, but only to explore and trade, not colonize.21 Cortés obeyed, but he was not necessarily going to comply. He had other ideas and, gathering some five hundred men, he set sail in eleven ships. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=463))
- He came to a stop on Good Friday in April 1519, at a promising harbor near an island the Spanish called San Juan de Ulúa. Cortés and his men went ashore, and they were met within the first couple of weeks by representatives of Moteuczoma, the ruler of the Mexica confederacy, which later accounts described as the “Aztec empire.” ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=474))
- This confederacy consisted of many different groups, but at its core was a triple alliance among the Nahuatl-speaking Mexica people, whose rise to power began in the fifteenth century, and the people of Texcoco and Tlacopan.26 The Maya and Mixtec-speaking people to the south were also connected, and the confederacy had a wide reach. These societies had their aristocracies and, like European kingdoms, complex social hierarchies. A powerful emperor was elected from within the alliance, though tradition dictated it was a Mexica man. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=478))
- By early August, Cortés began his overland trek to the capital city Tenochtitlán (today’s Mexico City). Over the months that followed, he and his men encountered various Mesoamerican peoples, confirming their suspicions that the empire was not as unified at it might have seemed. The Totonac were not the only disgruntled subjects: the Mexica confederacy had been built on the conquest of other peoples. They were forced to pay tribute but, crucially, local leaders and regimes were left in power. What had held the confederacy together was force. It was believed to have the power to enforce its political will, as embodied by the emperor. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=501))
- Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlán on November 8, 1519, and the world he entered was on a much larger and more urbanized scale than anything he had yet encountered. For a start, Tenochtitlán was a wonder in itself, sitting on an island on placid Lake Texcoco in the verdant Valley of Mexico, surrounded by mountains and more than a mile above sea level. The thin, cool air would have been a marked change from the always-present pressure of tropical humidity at sea level. The city was connected to the land around the lake by a system of causeways that could be removed to stop invasions. ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=512))
- The capital was estimated to have a population of around 150,000 by the time the Spanish arrived, making it far larger than any European city—Seville, for instance, numbered around forty thousand people at the time.35 The Valley of Mexico was home to an estimated 1 million to 2.65 million people. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=516))
- Spain soon placed this territory firmly in the constellation of its kingdoms, calling it Nueva España, or New Spain. By 1526, a decree had put all the land under the crown, the mining of silver deposits had begun, and taxes and Indian tribute were collected. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=564))
- In 1535 New Spain was proclaimed a vice-royalty, with the viceroy—appointed from Spain for a term that varied in length—to represent the king. New Spain was not a colony but part of the Spanish crown. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=576))
- In general, cities and towns were to be the cornerstone of conquest. The built environment of these places, and the many administrators who governed them, reflected the Spanish familiarity with urban living, as well as a preoccupation with keeping order. The maze-like narrow streets of Muslim Andalusian cities, such as Seville or Granada, were thought to be counterproductive for such aims. Instead, a grid system was deemed more useful. This had been employed with success in Santo Domingo, and so it became the template—refined and adapted over time—for Spanish cities in the Americas, whose number began to grow throughout the sixteenth century. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=583))
- Francisco Pizarro began his campaign against the Inca empire in Peru in 1530, and within fifty years, Spain claimed the length of the continent for itself, from the Caribbean coast through the Andes Mountains and into Chile and Argentina. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=589))
- The way cities were built across these diverse areas followed a form that was later enshrined in Spain’s Laws of the Indies. Urban settlements were to have a main plaza, around which would be a grid of streets. The governor’s house, administrative offices, and a church would occupy the plaza, and the most prominent families lived nearby. The lower members of society—often indigenous—lived the farthest away from the plaza in houses made of wood or other poorer materials. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=591))
- the Spanish crown and not the pope made appointments of bishops and archbishops to the Americas, and it could collect the Church’s tithe income. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=602))
- In order to swell the numbers of converts, mass baptisms were performed—sometimes on hundreds or even thousands of people at once, who may or may not have been clear on what was taking place. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=608))
- Amerindians may have lived in or near missions, but under the sixteenth-century policy of reducción, they were expected to form Christian, indigenous towns; Spain’s way of exerting control over often disparate groups was to forcibly resettle hundreds of thousands of people. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=612))
- West Africans bought and sold on the Iberian Peninsula began to appear in Hispaniola by 1502. This was followed by licensing of such a trade in 1513, by which point it is likely enslaved people were brought directly from West Africa to the Caribbean, contravening the existing trade rules. By 1518, licensing for the direct transport of slaves was in place, and thousands of enslaved people could now be taken to all parts of Spain’s growing empire. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=665))
- Between 1514 and 1600, some 250,000 enslaved Africans were forced to disembark in Spain’s Caribbean and mainland colonies, with many destined to work in gold and silver mines during this period. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=673))
- The crown was moved to issue the 1542 New Laws of the Indies (Las Leyes Nuevas), which was intended, once again, to promote better treatment of the indigenous people. Furthermore, the laws aimed to phase out the encomienda when the titleholder died and free any Indians on it.91 This legislation was unsurprisingly not popular among encomenderos and triggered a revolt by a group of them in Peru, leading to the decapitation of the viceroy. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=687))
- The Habsburg monarchy, which now controlled Spain and its colonies, also included parts of Italy, the Netherlands, and, for a time, Portugal (1580–1640).94 When Felipe II came to the Spanish throne in 1556, he ruled over a vast but troublesome realm.* ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=697))
- Las Casas helped to lay the basis of what became known as the leyenda negra, or “Black Legend,” a concept that would color the exploits of conquistadores and darken Spain’s reputation for centuries. In its simplest form, it was the allegation that Catholic conquistadores were uniquely evil and bloodthirsty—an accusation which overlooked similar abuses committed by Protestant Europeans in the Americas—but it also took issue with the reach of Felipe II’s powers, and with the Catholic orthodoxy defended by the Spanish Inquisition, ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=700))
- 1519, the Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda sailed from Jamaica, then still a Spanish colony, and traveled around the Gulf coast of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and New Spain. He may have been the first European to see the Mississippi River, which he called the Espíritu Santo, a name that was used on maps for a time. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=739))
- On the 1519 map of the Gulf that is attributed to Álvarez de Pineda, the outline of La Florida and its connection to a larger mainland are clear, ending the notion of its being an island. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=743))
- Ponce was wounded by an arrow and taken to Cuba, where he developed gangrene and died in July 1521. That was not the end of Ponce, of course. He lives on in the still popular myth that he was on the hunt for a magical wellspring that would provide the waters of eternal life. Despite all tales to the contrary, Ponce was not looking for this Fountain of Youth. The legend, however, started early, in Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés’s Historia general y natural de las Indias in 1535, and from there became forever associated with Ponce.

- Spanish ship landed near Winyah Bay (near present-day Myrtle Beach), on the feast of John the Baptist in June 1521.111 It was under the charge of Pedro de Quejo, who first spotted land. He waited for the caravel commanded by Francisco Gordillo to join him. The men and some of the crew went ashore, where they were met by a group of Indians. The Spaniards captured some of these people and took them on board their ships—they had, after all, intended this to be a slaving mission.112 When Gordillo and Quejo returned to Hispaniola, they had with them a young man who was probably from the Catawba people and whom they named Francisco de Chicora.113 El Chicorano, as he was sometimes called, was quick to learn Spanish and he also was baptized. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=756))
- Chicorano told them how it was fertile and full of riches, including gold, whetting the Spaniards’ appetite to establish a colony in this place, which they called Chicora. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=764))
- Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, a member of the judicial audiencia in Santo Domingo and the organizing force behind the expedition that had brought Francisco de Chicora to the island, echoed these claims, describing it as “new Andalusia.” He managed to obtain the necessary contract for exploration and settlement by 1523.115 While he was making preparations, he sent Quejo to reconnoiter the area in 1525. On that voyage, Quejo reached as far north as modern Cape Fear, North Carolina, naming on the way Río de la Cruz, today’s Savannah River.116 He stopped and met some of the Muskogean-speaking people there before pushing on. ([Location 765](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=765))
- He also returned to the site of his 1521 landfall and named it Punta de Santa Elena. Its exact location remains unclear, but it is thought to correspond to the present-day Port Royal Sound.117 ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=771))

- A rudimentary colony, named San Miguel de Gualdape, was established in the late summer of 1526; it was the first Spanish settlement in this part of North America, nearly two thousand miles to the north of Mexico. It was named for St. Michael the archangel, whose feast day, September 29, was close at hand.122 Being coastal, it was hot, sandy, and marshy, and a poor choice for a colony. Ayllón died on October 18, and the fragile settlement fell into chaos. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=784))
- Narvaéz landed around modern Tampa Bay, though he failed to make any alliances with the Tocobaga people. They did, however, tell him about a place that Narváez believed might have gold—as well as corn, as food was already running low—in the province of Apalachee.129 It was a considerable distance north from the Tocobaga, who may well have made up the story to get rid of these bearded interlopers; perhaps, too, the Apalachee were their enemies at this time, and the arrival of Narváez would be an unwelcome surprise. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=800))
- Second in command on this expedition was Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who came from a family of conquistadores. He grew up in Andalusia, near Jérez, though he left as a young man to participate in military campaigns in Europe, after which he received a royal appointment to go on the Florida expedition.132 Little could he imagine at the time that this voyage would take him well beyond the boundaries of the known world. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=808))
- Cabeza de Vaca went on foot with Narvaéz, and for the first two weeks they walked north from today’s Tampa Bay. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=812))
- The number of survivors dwindled from one hundred to four men after disease, starvation, and attacks killed the rest, including Narváez, leaving only Cabeza de Vaca, Estevánico, Dorantes, and Castillo. Cabeza de Vaca later recounted, “We were in such a state that our bones could easily be counted and we looked like the picture of death.”135 The four men continued west on foot, through what would be today’s Texas, later crossing the Río Grande, encountering many chiefdoms of Native Americans.

- De Soto set out from Spain with around 840 people and nine ships, with all the necessary tools and weapons for settlement.142 They stopped in Cuba, and then headed north, landing at Bahía Honda (Deep Bay), around present-day Tampa Bay, in May 1539. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=852))

- De Soto saw large villages and temple mounds, and survived on corn, game, and fish. He was not on a cultural mission, however—he pillaged crops, enslaved Indians, and launched attacks. He and his men moved up through Florida, battling the Apalachee, then into Georgia and South Carolina, where he was lured into a hunt for the chiefdom of Cofitachequi.146 It is thought that de Soto crossed the southern Appalachian Mountains, encountering the Muskogean-speaking people. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=861))
- He moved into Alabama, meeting the Choctaw. At one point, lured by chief Tuscaluza, they reached Mabila, in central Alabama, where they were attacked and many Spaniards were killed.147 From there, they also spent time among prosperous and settled people, such as the Caddo and Creeks, in Mississippi. They met the Chickasaw and Tupelo and may have crossed the Mississippi River in 1541. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=865))
- de Soto was clearly searching for more than just a place to put a settlement—he wanted to find more wealth.148 He also was on the lookout for the still elusive shortcut to the east.149 Finding neither, he remains one of the first known Europeans to wander through great swaths of North America. During the course of his wanderings he drained much of his fortune and, perhaps, his sanity. He decided to turn back but fell ill and died, it is believed somewhere in Arkansas or Louisiana near the Mississippi River, around May or June 1542. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=868))
- The rest of his party turned south, hoping to return to New Spain, ending up spending the winter building boats near today’s Natchez, Mississippi. Finally, the three hundred men headed down the Mississippi River, reaching the Gulf of Mexico in September 1543; it is possible they were the first Europeans to sail on that river. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=873))
- By the mid-1550s, claims began to circulate that the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, who had been in the service of France’s king, had reached the northern part of La Florida, around modern North Carolina, in 1524. Now the French were planning some sort of venture to that area and Spain’s Council of the Indies was eager to prevent such an encroachment from taking place. In ([Location 876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=876))
- For almost fifty years following Ponce’s initial 1513 voyage, no one from the Spanish empire had been able to make anything stick in La Florida. It was a very different world from the one Cortés found in Mexico. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=903))
- A frustrated Felipe II decreed in 1561 that he would grant no further permissions for these expensive and embarrassing expeditions to colonize Florida. His ruling, however, meant nothing to the French. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=908))
- THERE WAS ANOTHER route to Santa Elena, though it was forged not by Spanish Catholic conquistadores but by French Protestants. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=928))
- Many Protestant English, Dutch, and French nobles and explorers were, by the mid-1550s, no longer willing to abide by the rules of the papacy, including papal bulls supporting the new lands Spain and Portugal had claimed. They, like thousands of other Europeans, were enraptured by tales of great riches. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=931))
- This was a battle over more than just religious ideology; the Dutch, along with Protestants elsewhere in Europe, including the English and French Huguenots, were seeking to justify their own involvement in the Americas and their right to explore, conquer, plunder, and enslave. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=933))
- Such desires found expression in the works of prominent thinkers such as the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, who argued for free navigation of the seas, as the Dutch were trying to extend their trading networks throughout the globe, including North America and the West Indies. ([Location 935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=935))
- With Protestant piracy on the rise, the Spanish islands turned to fort-building: in Puerto Rico, for instance, work on Castillo San Felipe del Morro began in 1539, along the north coast of the island, near the city of San Juan, which had been founded in 1521. Such forts were meant to protect the haul of empire on the ships that went to Spain and returned with European wares for the settlers. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=939))
- The flota would set off twice a year, leaving Seville (and, later, Cádiz once the river in Seville became too silted) for Veracruz, while another fleet, the Tierra Firme or galeones, sailed to Cartagena, Colombia, and onward to Portobelo, Panama. Goods from Peru would come up to Panama and be taken overland to Portobelo; the same would happen with silks and other luxury goods from the east that arrived in Acapulco and traveled overland to Veracruz. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=942))
- Then, in the spring, the ships would return, uniting in Havana before crossing the Atlantic. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=945))
- Other Protestants were seeking not riches but sanctuary from the religious wars erupting in Europe. One such eager group was the French Calvinists, known as Huguenots, who faced mounting persecution by the 1560s. They imagined these new lands might offer a peaceful place to live and worship. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=950))
- A scheme to place a settlement on the other side of the Atlantic won the backing of the crown, with Catherine de Médicis supporting the idea on behalf of her young son, Charles IX. It also was popular with Gaspard de Coligny, a French admiral and himself a Huguenot. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=952))
- The waterways that spread out like veins in the South Carolina lowlands could have guided the vessels of the first French expeditions from Port Royal Sound to a landing spot on the edge of Parris Island in May 1562, but this was not their initial stopping point. Farther to the south, they called instead at the mouth of the St. Johns River, in the north of Florida, which runs into the Atlantic Ocean not far from today’s Jacksonville. The French named it the Rivière de Mai, marking the month of their arrival. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=955))
- However, Ribault wanted to explore farther to the north, arriving a couple of weeks later at an inlet that they named Port Royal. It was here that he established Charlesfort, named in honor of Charles IX. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=968))
- Inland to the north and west were the people the Europeans would later call the Creeks, who were related to the wider Muskogean-speaking people of the region and whose nation covered parts of the modern states of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana, as well as Florida. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=979))
- Laudonnière had departed France in April 1564 with three ships: a three-hundred-ton galleon as the flagship, and two smaller vessels. They arrived in June at the St. Johns River.23 This time, Laudonnière decided not to return to Charlesfort, instead establishing Fort Caroline on a bluff overlooking the river. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1021))
- Despite the setbacks, Menéndez regrouped and managed to arrive somewhere near Cape Canaveral just after Ribault returned to the St. Johns River, in late August 1565. When Menéndez discovered the whereabouts of the French fleet, a brief skirmish broke out between the Spanish and French ships, the latter managing to block the entrance to the mouth of the river. Menéndez decided to head south to an inlet he had spotted earlier. Once he and his men reached shore, they claimed Florida—again—for the king, and named this stopping point St. Augustine, as they had first sighted land on August 28, the feast day of that saint.32 A sandbar lay across the inlet, and while this meant the flagship had to be anchored farther out, the harbor would help protect them from attack.33 ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1046))
- Now the Spanish would try to assert their authority in this part of Florida. They took control of Fort Caroline in 1565 and renamed it San Mateo. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1078))
- Many native women were used as domestic servants and concubines, entrapped in servitude and sexual slavery. This was not unique to Florida, and throughout Spanish America, the subsequent offspring of these relationships were known as mestizos. An elaborate casta (caste) system of racial hierarchy took shape, ranking the mixtures of people, with the most “Spanish” being at the top and the most indigenous or African at the bottom. These racialized ideas were connected to an older concept from the Iberian Peninsula—limpieza de sangre, or “purity of blood”—that was concerned with a person’s possible Jewish or Muslim ancestry. ([Location 1103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1103))
- Menéndez also discovered that if he hugged the eastern coastline rather than battling the Gulf Stream, a smoother journey could be made to Havana. ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1128))
- Before long, the main settlement in Florida was St. Augustine, not Santa Elena, which was another two hundred miles up the coast.50 However, Felipe II wanted a presence in Santa Elena to forestall any future arrivals of the French, and so in April 1566, Menéndez and 150 soldiers went there and established Fort San Felipe close to the old Charlesfort location. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1129))
- Pardo headed west into North Carolina and went as far as Tennessee, meeting many Native Americans along the way and setting up two more forts, one of which was Fort San Juan near the Indian village of Joara (sometimes Joada), near modern Morganton, North Carolina. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1143))
- Menéndez’s plan was to put soldiers, settlers, and missionaries along the length of Florida, which the Spanish considered to be from the tip of the peninsula up to around the Chesapeake Bay, or the Bahía de Santa María, as it was called.61 That bay was particularly important because it was thought to connect to the fabled Northwest Passage, which would link Spanish America to Asia. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1161))
- In the end, it was neither Orista nor French attacks that ended Santa Elena, but those of the English. Francis Drake’s assault on St. Augustine in 1586 was an impetus for Menéndez Márquez to bring the Santa Elena settlers to that town to help rebuild it and shore up its defenses, even though Drake had been unable to find Santa Elena and so it was left unharmed. In the face of much protest, the governor forced the settlers to leave in 1587, and the fort was dismantled. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1187))
- A reply came that same year in the form of the king’s ordinances of discovery (Ordenanzas de descubrimiento, nueva población y pacificación de las Indias), stipulating that now “discoveries are not to be called conquests since we wish them to be carried out peacefully and charitably.”85 He ordered that the missionaries—not adelantados—lead this effort, with the military now charged with defending the missions. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1242))
- these missions reached only as far north as San Diego de Satuache, by the Ogeechee River, south of today’s Savannah.87 Others were dotted southward along the coast, in places such as St. Catherines Island, then known as Santa Catalina de Guale, all the way to St. Augustine. By 1596, there were nine doctrinas and a dozen friars, and they would continue to spread south and west. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1250))
- It took more than half a century, but the Spanish managed to put a settlement in Florida, drive out the French, win Indian alliances, and even have thousands of converts by the early 1600s. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1318))
- The Zuni were one group out of a much larger and diverse community that the Spanish categorized together under the umbrella term “pueblo,” the Castilian word for town or village. They used it because the people in this area were sedentary and resided in what the Spanish considered to be recognizable towns. Pueblo villages were dotted along the Río Grande valley in New Mexico, reaching to the west and north into today’s northern Arizona. The people of the pueblos had common ancestral roots in the Anasazi, who lived in the region around AD 1000. By the time of the Spaniards’ arrival, they were gone and their descendants had diversified, reaching an estimated population of around sixty thousand. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1375))
- Many of the Pueblo towns had the right conditions for agriculture, and so for the most part they were settled farming communities, growing crops such as maize. Their societies were organized by clan, usually with matrilineal descent, though men were often polygamous. Families lived in adobe homes, frequently extending them into compounds as a family grew. These dwellings could reach multiple stories and were accessed by a system of ladders. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1388))
- Despite these general similarities, the broad linguistic groups among the Pueblo considered themselves socially and culturally different from one another, though there were points of overlap, one of which would be the shared experience of dealing with the Spanish. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1393))
- These settled pueblos were surrounded by nomadic people, including the Apache, Navajo, and Ute. The Apache traded with the pueblos, bringing valuable buffalo meat and hides to towns; they were also feared for their violent raids.19 The Plains Indians went as far west as the Taos Pueblo in order to trade. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1395))
- In 1581, Franciscan Agustín Rodríguez set off on one such mission, though by this point it had been a considerable interval since Coronado’s failed effort. Rodríguez was accompanied by two other priests, as well as Captain Francisco Sánchez and a handful of soldiers. They reached the Río Grande and continued into Pueblo territory. They traded and had peaceful interactions with the people they met, and Rodríguez named the territory San Felipe del Nuevo México around this time. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1445))
- The prisoners were later put on trial because, Oñate said, they were judged as having broken their loyalty to the king. The sentences were severe: men over the age of twenty-five were to have their right foot amputated and to be put into servitude; younger men and women were to be put into twenty years of service to the Spaniards; and children were divided between the missionaries (girls) and direct supervision by Vicente de Zaldívar (boys). ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1522))
- Broadly speaking, Pueblo religious practices had much in common with those of other Mesoamerican cultures, drawing from the weather and seasons, using medicine men or healing priests, with rituals devoted to the fertility of people and the land. Some of the indigenous and Catholic rites overlapped, such as the use of water in baptism and singing during services. Likewise, certain symbols could have multiple meanings; for instance, a cross was interpreted as an important type of prayer stick. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1555))
- The Apache, in particular, had proved adept at learning to use a tool introduced by the Spanish: the horse, which transformed them into an even more fearsome enemy. ([Location 1615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1615))
- After more than a hundred years of attempting to settle this region, the Spanish in New Mexico remained on the fringes not only of their empire but of a world still dominated by Native Americans. ([Location 1699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1699))
- For once, the Spanish name came from mythology rather than Catholicism. “California” is thought to be based on the imaginary island of the same name, which was under the rule of Queen Calafia, a character from a tale written around 1510 by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1710))
- The story was set in the context of fighting between Christians and Muslims where Calafia wades into battle and in the end marries and converts to Christianity. ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1717))
- Cortés to make the journey himself, and, setting sail from Acapulco, he landed in Baja around 1535. His settlement around modern La Paz, almost directly across the Gulf of California from Culiacán, lasted less than two years.124 Despite its failure, Cortés sent Francisco de Ulloa on another expedition, and in 1539 Ulloa navigated around the Gulf of California. After Ulloa, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo left from the small port of Navidad, on the Pacific coast about 450 miles northwest of Acapulco, in 1542, sailing into a natural harbor he called San Miguel, later renamed San Diego.125 Cabrillo and his men continued along the coast, but he died during the voyage and the ships returned to New Spain. Enthusiasm for further costly exploration diminished as silver was found inland and trade boomed with the establishment of the Spanish in the Philippines in 1565. California, for the moment, fell by the wayside. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1719))
- Indeed, its next visitor would be not Spanish, but English.

This one, in 1602, was led by Sebastián Vizcaíno, who had spent time in Manila and had already sailed around parts of Baja California.129 On this voyage, he reached as far north as Cape Mendocino before bad weather forced him to return, naming San Diego and the bay of Monterey, the latter in honor of the viceroy of New Spain who had sent him on the journey: Gaspar de Zúñiga Acevedo y Fonseca, the fifth Count of Monterrey.

- Some Spanish and Pueblo ruins have become park sites, and tourists in New Mexico can walk among the former villages and missions of San Gregorio de Abó, Gran Quivira, and Quarai, all of which date back to the 1620s and today make up the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument.

- The English were already familiar with such enterprises—before they started looking across the Atlantic, they had focused on Ireland. More than one hundred thousand people, mainly Protestants from England, Wales, and especially Scotland, left for Ireland in the seventeenth century, setting up “plantations”—a system that rewarded them with land ownership and altered the dynamics of social and political relations to the detriment of the Catholic Irish. The island had been made a part of Henry VIII’s kingdom in 1541, but the settlement process accelerated under James I’s Plantation of Ulster, in 1609. These developments, however, met with periods of fierce Irish resistance and required the presence of tens of thousands of soldiers. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1815))
- Settlement expeditions were costly, and so would-be colonizers had to possess the money themselves or raise it through crown-sanctioned joint-stock companies.2 The first serious attempt to place a colony in North America was promoted by the adventurer Walter Raleigh, who was also an Irish landowner. He received a charter from Elizabeth I to put a settlement in what the Spanish considered to be Florida but the English thought of as being “not inhabited by Christian people.”3 A place was found in 1585 between the long stretch of barrier islands along modern North Carolina’s Outer Banks and the mainland, near the Albemarle Sound. These English settlers lived among the Roanoke people, and so the place adopted that name, in an area they called Virginia, thought to be named in honor of the Virgin Queen, though perhaps also inspired by a powerful local chief, Wingina. Although Raleigh did not join the settlers, he hoped the spot would prosper as a base for privateering attacks on the Spanish fleet. Indeed, Francis Drake sailed there after his May 1586 sacking of St. Augustine. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1820))
- This failure did not dim English enthusiasm for overseas colonies, and plans to try again were aided by the 1604 Treaty of London. This accord ended, for the time being, the hostilities between Spain and England, and trading resumed. James I had come to the English throne in 1603, and his counterpart in Spain, Felipe III, had ascended in 1598. Although James I wanted to improve relations with Spain, many of the English remained distrustful of Catholic Spaniards, while some of the Spanish were wary of England’s designs on the Americas. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1833))
- The English settlement, organized by the Virginia Company, was farther north than Roanoke, in the Chesapeake Bay area. To the Spanish this had been the ill-fated land of Ajacán that they had abandoned a century earlier, but to the English it was Jamestown, named for James I. In the same year that ships departed for Virginia, other vessels headed farther north, funded by the Plymouth Company, which also had a charter. Those settlers established the Popham Colony in 1607, on the Kennebec River in today’s Maine, and built a small fort. However, after a year—including a harsh winter—its colonists returned to England. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1860))
- Virginia struggled on, and its early years were precarious. The settlers died in droves from disease and hunger—some ten thousand people arrived between 1607 and 1622, but only around two thousand were alive by 1622.11 The crown, however, realized that this colony could be a useful place to send the potentially troublesome as well as the poor, for instance shipping some two hundred impoverished children there in 1618–19.12 ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1865))
- While the Spanish crown had permitted, and in the earliest years even encouraged, marriage between Amerindians and Spaniards, the English did not follow suit. ([Location 1874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1874))
- The English puzzled over Algonquin land management and often claimed that land was not being “used,” as a justification for trying to buy, barter, or take it away from the Indians. To work the land was to own it, and this pattern was repeated throughout the Tidewater region.17 The English philosopher John Locke, who would go on to become a secretary to one of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina and a shareholder in the slave-trading Royal African Company, believed that laboring to “improve” land was at the heart of the colonizing project. He wrote much later in his 1690 Two Treatises of Government that “as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property,” arguing that “the extent of the ground is of so little value without labour.” ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1888))
- After some deliberation, the Council of the Indies in Spain finally recommended an attack on Virginia in 1611, though the expedition never materialized. In its place were diplomatic complaints and a slight expansion of the St. Augustine garrison, because it was the closest point to the English.19 The crown did not want to risk another long, costly conflict with England. Spain’s unwillingness to act may have avoided problems for the time being, but the longer-term ramifications were profound: it allowed the English to cement their place in North America and the wider Atlantic world. Not long after the establishment of Jamestown, other colonies were placed on islands with little or no Spanish presence, including St. Kitts in 1623 and Barbados in 1627. The English also later took Jamaica as a consolation prize from the Spanish in 1655 after a failed attempt to capture Santo Domingo. ([Location 1895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1895))
- Although Henry VIII had broken with Rome in 1533, the particulars of English Protestantism were in no way settled. The Puritans, who followed the teaching of John Calvin, pushed for further changes in the Anglican Church; indeed the term “Puritan” was initially meant as an insult by Anglicans who viewed them as extremists. There was much disagreement within Puritan circles on how changes should be accomplished, but in general their aims included the creation of a more direct relationship with God and a less formal worship service. Such dissent, however, was interpreted in different ways by subsequent monarchs, and so at times Puritan beliefs could be perilous. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1913))
- The most famous group of dissenters, the Pilgrims, were the first to make that crossing. They were also Calvinists but were more extreme than other Puritans in their demands. Their ship, the Mayflower, arrived in 1620; they landed on the easternmost hook of modern Massachusetts before crossing the bay and establishing their Plymouth Colony. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1919))
- Indeed, Cecilius Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, received a charter in 1632 that would become the colony of Maryland, which was intended to be a place of tolerance and refuge for Catholics who faced discrimination in England, though the initial settlers in 1634 also included Protestants.23 By this time, the Puritans were leaving England in droves, having established the Massachusetts Bay Colony near the Pilgrim settlements in 1630. Some thirty thousand Puritans, many of whom had been middle-class merchants in England and would be so again, migrated over the course of the 1630s. ([Location 1922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1922))
- Mexico City, for instance, had a population of at least 150,000 by 1620, a university, and a cathedral.26 The town of Boston, some thirty years later, in 1650, hovered around only 2,000 souls. ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1931))
- In 1663, Charles II issued a grant to a group of investors—who were also supporters of his restoration to the throne after the English Civil War—for a settlement to be called Carolina. Soon English ships were exploring the waterways around Santa Elena, though the main port, Charles Town (modern Charleston, South Carolina), was placed a bit farther north, around the Ashley River, in 1670. That same year, England and Spain hammered out the terms of the Treaty of Madrid, drawn up to ease tensions between the two brought about by a number of attacks between English and Spanish ships in the Caribbean. It was a turning point in Anglo-Spanish relations, finally granting official recognition to British claims on Jamaica and Virginia and placing the boundary of Spanish Florida at N 32°30´, with Charles Town sitting just north of this border. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1947))
- in 1672, the Royal African Company was granted a monopoly on all English trade between the west coast of Africa, the Caribbean, and the North American colonies, and English ships joined those of the Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch in violently forcing the migration of Africans. ([Location 1953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1953))
- not all slaves were African. Native American enslavement remained a significant component of labor throughout the English colonies at this time, and into the eighteenth century. The English considered conflict with the Indians a “just war,” and so any captivity or enslavement was deemed fair. Native Americans made up the majority of nonwhite labor in New England before 1700, with some thirteen hundred people enslaved at this time.36 The definition of slavery was also nebulous in this period, with servitude and unfair indenture contracts leading to a form of enslavement, even after 1700 when Indian enslavement was made illegal. ([Location 1963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=1963))
- as early as 1534, Jacques Cartier explored around Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River, claiming the area for France, though his attempts to set up a trading post failed. After further intermittent efforts, the French finally enjoyed some success in 1608, when Samuel de Champlain erected a settlement at Quebec. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2007))
- From there, they spread in two directions. First, they moved into what they called New France, along the Gulf of St. Lawrence and toward the Great Lakes, where they were trapping animals and trading lucrative furs; they also went into the southern part of the Mississippi valley. In addition, as the English and Dutch had done, they took some Caribbean islands, including Martinique (1635), Guadeloupe (1635), and, by the end of the seventeenth century, Saint-Domingue (1697), which was the eastern third of Spanish Santo Domingo. ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2010))
- The Spanish had explored much of the Gulf and considered it part of their territory, though it remained sparsely settled. Thus, when René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, decided to start his travels on the Mississippi River in February 1682, there was no Spaniard to stop him. La Salle, who traversed much of French America, also believed in the dream of a passage to the Pacific. Hoping to find it, his party of twenty-two Frenchmen and eighteen Native Americans, seven of whom were women, set out from where the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers meet, just north of modern St. Louis. On their way south, they passed today’s Missouri, Ohio, and Arkansas Rivers, before arriving near the mouth of the Mississippi in April.48 There was no obvious route west, but undeterred, they claimed the area that surrounded the Mississippi River for Louis XIV, calling it La Louisiane. ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2014))
- The next significant French expedition came under the leadership of Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, who managed to find the mouth of the Mississippi River and navigate through its maze of channels. He established a settlement in Biloxi Bay in 1699 and, near the coast, a small military outpost, Fort Maurepas, which would serve as the first capital for the Louisiana territory. ([Location 2033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2033))
- French interaction with Amerindians was markedly different from that of the Spanish. Rather than using an encomienda-style labor system like the Spanish, or developing plantations along the lines of the English, many of the French started their commercial exploits by trading furs, such as beaver. French traders often resided at close quarters with Native Americans and, over time, they were able to build intimate ties with many chiefdoms, partnering with indigenous women and having children, who were known as métis. Profitable furs were sent to France, and guns and manufactured wares were shipped over to be sold to the Indians. ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2041))
- Some Jesuits also participated in exploration missions, such as Jacques Marquette, who was a member of the party that in 1673 discovered a route from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River, which La Salle would travel all the way down nine years later. ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2050))
- in northern New Spain, the Spanish continued their attempts to broker alliances with the Native Americans west of the Mississippi River, including the Caddo-speaking Hasinai people, with the aim of buffering any French advances into that territory. ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2054))
- The Hasinai were part of the larger Caddo confederacy, which spread out in East Texas and western Louisiana. Although there were some twenty-five different chiefdoms, their ways of life had certain shared characteristics. They were mostly agricultural, growing crops like maize and squash, supplemented by the hunting of bison and other animals. They were also sedentary, living in grass homes in villages that also included temple mounds. ([Location 2056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2056))
- The Spanish began to call this region Tejas, also spelled Texas, after the Hasinai word for “friends” or “allies,” ta-sha. ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2060))
- THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY opened with a crisis in Europe. Spain’s Hapsburg king, Carlos II, died in 1700 with no heir. The prospect of the Spanish throne passing to a French Bourbon, Philippe d’Anjou, the grandson of María Theresa—Carlos’s half sister and the first wife of Louis XIV—left the rest of the continent with serious concerns about the balance of power if France and Spain were united. England, Holland, and Austria went to battle against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, a conflict that spilled into the colonies and was known in North America as Queen Anne’s War (1702–13). ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2068))
- the English, aided by Indian allies and led by the South Carolina governor James Moore, attacked the Spanish in 1702. They had worked their way down from South Carolina, destroying a Spanish fort on Amelia Island and fortifications near the St. Johns River. ([Location 2074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2074))
- The war ended in 1714, with Philippe, now Felipe V, on the Spanish throne after renouncing his French claims. The British—as they had become when the Acts of Union created Great Britain by uniting England and Scotland in 1707—emerged victorious from the negotiations of the Treaty of Utrecht. They were ceded much of France’s territory in Canada, including Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Hudson Bay. In addition, within Europe, Spain was forced to turn over Gibraltar and the island of Minorca to Britain. Also as significant, the British won the lucrative asiento, a contract that granted its traders an exclusive right to supply African slaves to Spanish America. ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2082))
- Among the most powerful groups to emerge in this period were the Creeks, also known as Muskogee. The Upper Creeks, as the Europeans called them, lived along the Tallapoosa and Coosa Rivers that feed into the Alabama River—near modern east Alabama and west Georgia. The Lower Creeks, as they were known, were situated along the Apalachicola River in Florida, and as far north as the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers.61 There was a constant jostle for influence, trade, and alliances among the Upper and Lower Creeks with the British and Spanish. ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2089))
- The Creeks also participated in slave raids for the British, who had started giving them goods—including arms and alcohol—on credit, allowing them to run up large debts. ([Location 2097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2097))
- Because the Spanish missions in Florida had been abandoned by the early 1700s, few Indians were left to enslave. They had to turn to deerskin to pay the British and became indebted to the tune of about one hundred thousand skins by 1711, something that would require years of labor to produce. The Creek people were angry about their treatment—not only what they considered trickery in allowing the debts to accumulate, but also the British habit of punishing indebted Indian men with humiliating public floggings. ([Location 2098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2098))
- A number of Native American nations, including the Upper Creeks and the Chickasaw, joined the Yamasee in attacking English settlements, and even some runaway black slaves joined the effort.64 After months of fighting, the British faced defeat, until they managed to enlist the help of the Cherokee people, who drove the Yamasee out of the Carolina territory and into Spanish Florida. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2104))
- In 1718, Governor Bienville claimed for France a small crescent of land near where the Mississippi River fans out into the Gulf, calling it La Nouvelle-Orléans, after the Duke of Orléans. ([Location 2108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2108))
- The French had also continued exploring north along the Mississippi River, building a small outpost in 1716 near the Red River, a tributary of the Mississippi that meanders from Louisiana through northeast Texas. This was close to the Natchitoches chiefdom, a group that was also part of the larger Caddo confederacy, with whom the French were eager to trade. The Natchitoches also distrusted the Spanish, in part because of their failed attempt at planting missions among the Hasinai in the 1690s. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2111))
- Two Franciscan missions were also built just to the west of Natchitoches—Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais and San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes, near San Augustine, Texas, and Robeline, Louisiana, respectively—in an attempt to establish a boundary between Spanish and French spheres of influence among Native Americans. In 1718, farther south, a presidio was placed near the headwaters of the San Antonio River, with the name San Antonio de Béxar. A mission—San Antonio de Valero—was built there in the same year and it would later be known as the Alamo.70 Four more missions were later added, strung southward along the San Antonio River. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2119))
- Despite a number of losses and setbacks in the first two decades of the eighteenth century, the Spanish managed to build up their presence in Texas to around 250 soldiers and ten missions, though they amounted to little more than specks on a landscape still dominated by Native Americans. While the French had been warded off, the lack of settlers in Texas was a growing concern because it hampered Spain’s ability to maintain control of its frontier. ([Location 2141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2141))
- The first reported instance of slaves fleeing from the plantations of South Carolina was in 1687. The Spanish baptized them as Catholics and gave them sanctuary. Word of this spread, causing many more slaves to make their way to Florida. Officials in St. Augustine were forced to ask the crown for guidance, and by 1693 a royal decree granted these refugees their freedom through conversion to Catholicism and a pledge to the crown. This helped Spain in two ways, by depriving the English of their labor force and by populating the frontier with people loyal to Spain. ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2166))
- Into this already volatile mix entered another English colony, though it would not follow the same path as Virginia or South Carolina. Instead, Georgia was to be a place for the “worthy poor” of Britain, according to the English social reformer James Edward Oglethorpe, who founded the colony, named for George II, with the intention of giving debtors in prison a new life. ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2179))
- Oglethorpe had served in the military and as a member of Parliament, where the squalor of British jails was brought to his attention. His goal was to establish a colony in North America in which to place those whose crime was often that of simple poverty, and by 1730 he had chosen a site by the Savannah River, with South Carolina to the north and Spanish Florida to the south. Oglethorpe presented the colony as a possible buffer zone between the two rivals—the people sent there could protect as well as work the land—and gambled on this being the key to winning government support. ([Location 2182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2182))
- St. Augustine continued to struggle and although Florida was considered strategic because of its proximity to the Caribbean, the city never developed into a port on the scale of San Juan or Havana. The coast remained difficult for growing crops, and settlers stayed away. The low-lying areas of Georgia and South Carolina, however, proved to be more fertile. With the introduction of enslaved labor, the region was soon a center of agricultural production and trade, through the port of Charles Town. By 1760, Georgia had a population of around six thousand British and another thirty-six hundred slaves, far more than the three thousand people in Florida. ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2270))
- THE FIRST HALF of the eighteenth century saw a rush of settlers to the colonies of British North America, and by 1760 more than a million Europeans had staked out new lives there.1 The bulk of the immigrants were English, Scottish, and Protestant Irish (Scots-Irish), but other Europeans also came over, with groups like the Swedes settling in Delaware and people from Germanic kingdoms fanning out across New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. ([Location 2280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2280))
- By the 1770s, the number of enslaved people, from Africa and born within the colonies, reached nearly half a million. ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2286))
- Spain had no equivalent surge in its North American lands. Estimates vary, but between 1506 and 1650 some 250,000 to 400,000 people made the voyage from various parts of Spain to the Americas, with more than half going to Peru or New Spain, joining the surviving indigenous peoples and the growing creole and mestizo population. Other Europeans, mostly Catholics, also arrived in Spanish America, including people from France, Portugal, and Italy, but their numbers were small; in New Spain only fifteen hundred non-Spaniards were estimated to have come between 1700 and 1760.4 ([Location 2288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2288))
- The number of enslaved people brought to Spanish America continued to rise, and by the late 1700s, the slave population was around 80,000 in the Caribbean islands and 271,000 throughout the rest of the colonies, including New Spain. ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2293))
- a battle for supremacy gripped all three powers by the middle of what had already been a violent and bloody eighteenth century. At first this played out in the Great Lakes region and along the St. Lawrence River, between the British and the French and their Indian allies. ([Location 2296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2296))
- the British started to expel the French-speaking Acadians who lived in the prized farmland on the North Atlantic peninsula of Nova Scotia, which had been ceded to Britain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; this expulsion further stoked French irritation. ([Location 2303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2303))
- In 1756 Britain and France declared war on each other, and the Seven Years’ War began in Europe. It subsumed the French and Indian War and spread to all parts of the world, turning into a truly global conflict. Its theaters were found in places ranging from the Great Lakes to the Caribbean, and India to Senegal. In North America much of the fighting was between the British and French, but at its heart were concerns about the power balances within Europe. ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2305))
- The battle lines were drawn between Britain and Prussia on one side, with France, Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Spain, which entered in 1762, on the other. ([Location 2309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2309))
- For much of the Seven Years’ War, Spain wanted to avoid the conflict, but its relationship to France ultimately dragged it in. Although the Bourbon crowns of Spain and France had been separated under the treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession, the two had a pacte de famille that reinforced their connections. ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2310))
- In June 1762 the British made a preemptive strike with a surprise attack on Havana, capturing it, and doing the same to the Spanish Pacific port of Manila. A few months later, in November, France and Spain signed the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, which ceded New Orleans and France’s huge Louisiana territory to Spain so that the British could not claim either should they win the war. For the Spanish, Louisiana could serve as an extra buffer to curb any desire of the British to expand west toward New Spain. ([Location 2313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2313))
- the 1763 Treaty of Paris were negotiated, Britain emerged triumphant. In the Americas, the British received all of French Canada, the Great Lakes region east of the Mississippi, and the Caribbean islands of Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago. France kept the tiny isles of St. Pierre and Miquelon in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Caribbean colonies of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Spain retained Louisiana, but the real issue was the return of Havana. The Spanish considered Cuba crucial to Atlantic trade and defense, so they ceded Florida to the British in exchange. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2317))
- The Louisiana territory, starting with a dot in New Orleans, spreading like ink-spill on paper, was a place where three peoples collided: the Spanish; the British and other European settlers of the trans-Appalachia region; and Native Americans. Each of the three was aware of the risks and rewards that the other two posed. ([Location 2323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2323))
- Catholicism still remained a powerful force in Spanish America, though it, too, had not escaped the reforming reach of Carlos III. In 1767 he had banished the Jesuit order from the entire Spanish realm. Although the Jesuits had long been a force for colonization, the king felt their power had grown too unwieldy. In North America, the Franciscans would take over what the Jesuits had been forced to relinquish. ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2383))
- Elsewhere in East Florida, a new people were forming: the Seminoles. By now, many of the indigenous peoples of Florida and the Southeast had weathered serious challenges: European disease, Christian conversion, wars against other Native Americans and Europeans, and the loss of land. Different groups of Native Americans were at times forced to merge with other chiefdoms for their very survival. The Seminoles were one such group. The word “seminole” is a possible corruption of the Spanish word for runaway slave, cimarrón, and there were many runaways among the Seminoles. The Lower Creeks who had moved into Florida made up the main body of the Seminoles, taking over former lands of the Timucua and Apalachee, as they had died or moved away. The runaway Africans who joined them were not re-enslaved; rather, they lived in their own villages and paid tribute to the Creeks each year as well as providing military assistance.41 ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2452))
- By this point, a distinct “American” identity had formed in the British colonies, based on ideas concerning land, trade, and certain rights within the imperial system. Now this identity was being further molded by the colonists’ growing anger. ([Location 2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2472))
- Though the opening shots of the American Revolution were in Massachusetts, West Florida would be a critical—and often overlooked—theater of the war. West Florida abutted Louisiana, putting the British and Spanish in close proximity, and many French people still lived in the territory, along with large Indian chiefdoms, including the Creek, Chickasaw, and Choctaw.46 As the rebellion developed in 1776, the Spanish at first watched from afar, though not long afterward rebel leaders reached out to officials in Louisiana and Spain in the hope of loans or supplies to help fight British troops. ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2477))
- Gálvez had organized a West Florida campaign by August 1779, with royal support from Madrid and backup from the garrison in Havana. It included thirteen hundred men on the ground, composed of regular troops, local militiamen, free blacks, Acadians, and even British refugees who had left West Florida, as well as Houma, Choctaw, and Alabama people.56 His men began to take small British outposts in West Florida, such as those in Manchac and Baton Rouge, in September, but the larger coastal forts—Mobile and Pensacola—were the real targets.

- Under the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain relinquished East Florida to Spain, and the boundary with the newly formed U.S. border was set at the St. Marys River. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2543))
- Well before Gálvez’s attacks in West Florida, there had been talks with Spain about U.S. access to the Mississippi River. Benjamin Franklin had broached the subject in the spring of 1777 in a letter to the Count of Aranda, saying that, should Spain help the Americans’ cause, they would “assist in reducing to the Possession of Spain the Town and Harbour of Pensacola,” though on the condition that “the Inhabitants of the United States shall have the free Navigation of the Missisipi [sic], and the Use of the Harbour of Pensacola.”60 Trade would put the new United States on the path to prosperity, and securing access to the Mississippi River was an early priority. Even while the war was raging, John Jay, then serving as minister to Spain, arrived in Cádiz in 1780 for a diplomatic mission that included concerns about the Mississippi. ([Location 2545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2545))
- The issue would end up being resolved by the Treaty of Paris, which said in Article 8 that “the navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States.”65 The peace deal also called for the boundary of the United States to be marked by a “line to be drawn along the middle of said river Mississippi until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of north latitude.” ([Location 2563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2563))
- UNDER THE BRITISH, the Proclamation Line of 1763 had forbidden colonists to go past the Appalachian Mountains, though many people ignored the rule and started to farm or engage in land speculation in the Ohio valley.73 Now, without British control, and with the Treaty of Paris granting the United States land north of N 31° and west to the Mississippi River, the region opened up. Legislation was passed to legitimize this expansion, including the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which paved the way for these lands to be territories first and states later on.

- On August 23, a group of men held their first convention in Jonesborough, electing John Sevier governor. A few months later, on December 14, they cast a vote among themselves to leave North Carolina and create a new state, naming it Franklin, in honor of Benjamin Franklin.78 The territory, though in North Carolina then, corresponded to the twelve easternmost counties in modern Tennessee. Its makeshift capital was moved to a cabin in Greeneville, also in Tennessee, in 1785. ([Location 2609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2609))
- The 1784 order closing the Mississippi was of great concern to everyone in the river valley, and so White proposed to Gardoqui that Spain open the river to trade with the southern territories, which would secede in order to protect their trade interests while also allowing themselves to “draw closer to His Majesty.”81 Gardoqui did not commit himself to White’s plan, though he could see the idea’s merits: the Franklinites wanted to trade, and the Spanish needed more loyal subjects in that region.

- Franklin was not the only territory making overtures to the Spanish. The Kentucky territory that was then part of Virginia had also expressed a desire to be separate, though it had not yet drawn up a constitution. Brigadier General James Wilkinson traveled to New Orleans in 1787 to meet with Esteban Miró, then governor of Louisiana. Wilkinson had left the east after the end of the Revolutionary War and bought 12,550 acres in Kentucky, paid for in part with money from friends in Philadelphia who were hoping to profit through land speculation. He set up as a merchant in Lexington and soon began to work out how to get around the Spanish prohibition on the Mississippi, eager to sell tobacco to Mexico via Spanish New Orleans.85 At this juncture the future of the United States was still fragile—in the same year Miró and Wilkinson met, the Constitutional Convention was taking place in Philadelphia, and the resulting document would not be promulgated until 1789. Who was part of the union and how that union would function were still very much up for discussion. ([Location 2638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2638))
- As had been the case with Franklin, if Kentucky joined Spain it would have access to the Mississippi and to Spain’s large American market. ([Location 2651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2651))
- Wilkinson also seized the moment to pursue another opportunity. Although he was still a member of the military, he became in future years a paid informer—later known as agent 13—for the Spanish, involved in a number of intrigues, information about which would often be paid for in silver dollars.90 In 1787, Wilkinson declared his loyalty to the Spanish crown and promised to bring more settlers to the region.

- one 1769 report listed twenty-three chiefdoms to which the Spanish were giving gifts, including the Iowa, Little and Big Osage, and Peoria peoples.96 Throughout the Revolutionary period and its aftermath, many Shawnee and Delaware people moved to Upper Louisiana to get away from the encroachment of U.S. settlers. The Spanish permitted them to stay to the south and west of Ste. Genevieve, and by the 1790s there were six villages with a Shawnee population of 1,200 and 600 Delaware, while farther south some Cherokees moved into Lower Louisiana.

- Cook was a late arrival in this corner of the world; the Spaniards had been sailing in nearby waters for some time. Spanish administrators had received reports as early as the 1740s about the activity of the Russians, who were inching over from their fur trading posts around the Aleutian Islands. Orders issued from Spain in 1761 called for a diplomat to make inquiries about “the discoveries of the Russians in their attempts of their navigation to California.”3 Russia in this period was growing in might, harboring its own imperial ambitions. As its fur trappers became more familiar with the coastline near Spanish possessions, it became clear that they could sail with ease into this territory and there would be no military garrison to stop them.

- On July 16, 1769, Serra placed a cross in the ground and dedicated San Diego de Alcalá, the first mission planted in Alta California. ([Location 2881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2881))
- Soon, Serra was able to add his second mission, San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo, alongside the civil presidio. The Spanish explored to the north after this, but San Francisco would not have a settlement until after 1775, when the San Carlos sailed into the bay. The following year, work began on a presidio and the mission San Francisco de Asís. At the same time, three thousand miles to the east, rebel forces in the British colonies had declared their independence. California, at this point, was still a world unto itself.

- Wider estimates of the language groups along all of Alta California claim that roughly ninety languages existed under the umbrella of seven broader linguistic families.49 The peoples of California were known to use cardinal directions—northern, southern—to describe who they were, but this concept was probably not understood by the Spaniards. ([Location 2909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2909))
- An accurate population figure is also complicated, but it is thought that some three hundred thousand Native Americans lived in Alta California at the time of the arrival of the Spanish. ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2915))
- The friars baptized the native Californians and gave them Spanish names, which were recorded in a mission register.54 The priests and officials likened them to children, and Native Americans were not considered gente de razón, or, literally “people of reason,” a social category that signified someone who spoke Castilian and was Catholic and loyal to the Spanish crown.55 It was a term that was meant to exclude Indians but was extended to mestizos, in part because most of the settlers who came to Alta California from New Spain and Baja during this time were varying degrees of mestizo, and in some cases of African origin as well. Twenty-six of the first forty-six settlers in the civilian pueblo Los Angeles, established in 1781, were either black or mulatto. ([Location 2925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=2925))
- This pattern of “whitening” was repeated throughout Alta California, in part because the necessities of frontier life wiped away many of the casta categories that dominated New Spain and replaced them with the local Californio identity of sin (without) razón or de (with) razón.58 This allowed a degree of social mobility and gave some black and even indigenous people access to privileges that may have been granted only to lighter-skinned or Spanish immigrants elsewhere in New Spain or the wider empire.

- The frontier missions in California, like those elsewhere in the Spanish empire, turned the religious orders into landowners and the indigenous people into their laborers. The missions were supposed to offer food, protection, and stability, though the arrival of the Spanish was part of what brought instability in the first place. Despite the conversions and changes, many of the California Indians retained their own beliefs within Catholicism; native symbols, for instance, were later found incorporated into mission decorations.

- By the 1790s, parties were being sent from St. Louis in Spanish Upper Louisiana to color in the unknown hinterland on the map. They headed west along the Missouri River valley, with hopes that waterways would lead out to Alta California and function as a Northwest Passage of sorts. British trappers in Canada, French settlers in Missouri, or adventurous young men from the United States, at times backed by Spanish officials in Louisiana, set out in search of a practical continental water route between east and west, but it, too, proved elusive.83 California would remain an island for a while longer.

- Calls in France for liberty, equality, and fraternity traveled across the Atlantic, reverberating loudly in Saint-Domingue.

- The then governor of Louisiana, Francisco Luis Héctor, Baron de Carondelet, issued propaganda critical of the Revolution in an effort to counter any positive reports from France.14 Carondelet, who was French-born but married into a prominent Spanish family and served the Spanish crown, was in office from 1791 to 1797, through much of this period of uncertainty, and he implemented a range of policies in his efforts to keep the peace. Not all were popular—some of the French called Carondelet cochon de lait (suckling pig). ([Location 3109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3109))
- Cuba and Puerto Rico, and to a lesser degree Louisiana, were in a position to turn their economies to sugar, taking over where Saint-Domingue had left off. Cuba, especially, would emerge as the sugar powerhouse of the Caribbean. ([Location 3139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3139))
- Despite the many restrictions placed on people of color in Louisiana, one tradition was not infringed upon: the Sunday afternoon assembling of enslaved people after the morning market in New Orleans, to drum and dance at a site on the edge of the city later known as Congo Square. Slaves were meant to be given the Sabbath off, and many in the city would gather for these “dances, or amusements.” This continued through the Spanish period, with the stipulation from officials that “they shall always cease before night” lest the slaves entertain more subversive notions.26 ([Location 3154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3154))
- Distracted by Spain’s involvement in the French Revolutionary Wars in Europe, and desiring a good relationship with the United States while simultaneously displaying little interest in Louisiana, in October 1795 he signed the Treaty of San Lorenzo, also known as Pinckney’s Treaty in the United States after the negotiator Thomas Pinckney.30 This treaty granted the United States everything it wanted, including confirmation of the West Florida boundary at N 31°, navigation and trade rights for U.S. ships on the Mississippi, a joint U.S.-Spanish effort to prevent cross-border Indian attacks, and sharing trade with Native Americans rather than competing over ([Location 3175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3175))
- THE SABINE RIVER flows down a narrow basin from its headwaters in northeast Texas, to where three creeks converge east of Dallas, stretching southeast before turning due south, covering around three hundred miles. Its name is thought to come from a Spanish word, sabina, after the cypress trees that line its banks. ([Location 3236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3236))
- By May 1808, Carlos IV had abdicated and his heir, Fernando VII, had been persuaded to go into exile in France by Bonaparte, who had his troops in Spain at the ready. Bonaparte then put his own brother, Joseph, on the Spanish throne. The outrage in Spain was immediate, and the uprisings that started in Madrid spread throughout the country and crossed the ocean. ([Location 3278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3278))
- the initial step in Spain and the Americas involved setting up a number of provincial councils, or juntas, around which national sovereignty and resistance to France could be organized.10 In Spain, the smaller regional juntas answered to a central junta, or junta suprema central, first based in Aranjuez, a town about thirty-five miles south of Madrid and home to one of the royal palaces. The central junta was soon pushed south by the fighting, to Seville and finally Cádiz, where British ships aided Spain by patrolling the coast.

- The majority of governors, viceroys, judges, bishops, and other officials were from Spain, yet by this point across Spanish America there was a large, established, and often wealthy population of creoles, many of whom were increasingly irritated by their place in colonial society. Here, too, an “American” identity was forming and drawing from both its European and its indigenous antecedents, a “creole patriotism” that had grown hostile to Spanish administrators. ([Location 3292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3292))
- The local and regional nature of the complaints across such a vast and diverse geography made it practically impossible for the kingdoms of Spanish America to come to any larger agreement, barring their shared loyalty to Fernando VII. It was a situation quite distinct from that of the thirteen British colonies, whose anger was directed at the king and which had a clearer sense of common goals. In Spanish America, tensions were not between the monarch and his subjects but between the monarch’s administrators and the people they were meant to oversee in his name.

- The demographic reality was that the Spanish were far outnumbered; by 1800 there were about 6 million people in New Spain. Of that population about 1.1 million or 18 percent were white creoles, while there were only 15,000 Spaniards from the peninsula. Indians made up about 60 percent of the population, and castas, including mestizo, mulatto, and black people, constituted the remaining 22 percent.

- The Spanish were trying to hold their own nation together while also attempting to highlight Spain’s place in the Americas by appealing to their “brothers” across the Atlantic through their shared language and religion as a justification for a continued connection, while burying the claims of past injustices.

- The instability, however, might settle the Florida matter for good, as Jefferson explained in 1809 in a letter to Madison, and it also raised the enticing possibility of obtaining Cuba: “Napoleon will certainly give his consent without difficulty to our receiving the Floridas, & with some difficulty, Cuba.”25 The growing profitability of the sugar island of Cuba, with its proximity to the United States, made it attractive to Jefferson and others as a natural addition to the slaveholding South. Indeed, even some New England investors already held stakes in Cuban plantations. ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3354))
- The Floridas also took a path different from that of their fellow Spanish American territories. In 1809, Carlos de Hault de Lassus was appointed governor of the Baton Rouge district of West Florida, though his unpopularity soon led to irritation and unrest. In 1810, a group of residents wanted to form a Spanish-style junta, which de Lassus permitted, in part to keep relations peaceful. Delegates from all parts of West Florida attended, some of whom were open about their wish to join the United States, while others wanted to ally with the British or simply remain under Spanish rule.29 The group met a number of times in July and August 1810, finally arousing Spanish suspicions. Vincent Folch, the West Florida governor based in Pensacola, threatened to break up the meetings, and rumors circulated that troops were being sent.30 In response, a group of the delegates attacked the small, crumbling fort in Baton Rouge, issuing a declaration of independence in late September, and raising a flag, a single white star on a blue background representing the Republic of West Florida.

- His concerns, however, did not preclude the U.S. annexation of part of West Florida—the area between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers—in late October. Madison believed this to be part of the Louisiana Purchase territory anyway, and now felt that “the Country to the Perdido [River], being our own, may be fairly taken possession of, if it can be done without violence.”32 On December 10, U.S. troops took formal control of the Baton Rouge area of West Florida.

- Mathews was able to round up enough “Patriots”—this conflict was later known as the Patriot War—to lead an attack on Fernandina, a town on the eastern side of Amelia Island, with ports that faced the St. Marys River. Mathews and his men marched into Fernandina on March 12, 1812, declaring East Florida independent. A few days later, and with the backing of U.S. gunboats, the whole of Amelia Island was ceded, and the Spanish garrison on Fernandina surrendered by March 25.41 From there, Matthews and his men wanted to march on St. Augustine. When news reached the new East Florida governor, Juan José de Estrada, he alerted his Indian allies and black militiamen.42 These groups had good reason to assist the Spanish—they knew U.S. control meant a loss of land and liberties. The Patriots arrived in April and St. Augustine was soon under siege, while protests from angry Spanish diplomats caused President Madison to disavow the whole affair.

- On his return to Texas, Gutiérrez stopped in New Orleans, where he made contact with the U.S. agent William Shaler and a former U.S. Army officer, Augustus Magee, who helped him recruit around one hundred willing Anglo adventurers to attack the royalists in Texas.50 They captured Nacogdoches on August 12, 1812, and headed toward the Gulf, taking the presidio at La Bahía del Espíritu Santo, near Goliad, in November.

- BY 1810 THE Cortes in Spain was in session, and the liberal reformers among the delegates seized the opportunity to create a constitution for Spain, an unprecedented move. The March 1812 Constitución política de la Monarquía Española made profound changes in the relationship between the monarch and his subjects. It curbed royal powers and placed sovereignty with the people, bolstering the role of an elected Cortes and promising a fairer share of representation to the Americas.* It also extended the vote to all men—including Indians and mestizos—in the Americas, without any property or literacy requirements, with the very notable exception of free black people.

- The Peninsular War in Spain, which also involved the Portuguese and British, ended in 1814 with the French driven out and Fernando VII restored to the throne. Despite all hopes and expectations to the contrary, he tore up the constitution, rejecting it completely. He instead reasserted his absolute authority, angering many in the Americas. This would stoke the fires in South America, as each former colony began to peel away from this point on: Mexico and Venezuela had been or soon would be joined by New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, and Río de la Plata (Argentina).

- On August 30, 1813, a group of some seven hundred Creeks attacked Fort Mims, a fortified outpost on a plantation about forty-five miles north of Mobile, in protest at growing U.S. encroachment on their land. Led by Red Eagle, whose father was a Scottish trader and whose mother was a Creek, the Indians killed around 250 people within the fort and set it on fire.65 The attackers were known as the Red Sticks, after the clubs they painted red and used in war. ([Location 3498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3498))
- The Red Sticks allied with the British, some of whom were agitating in the Florida and Georgia borderlands.69 ([Location 3506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3506))
- Fighting continued throughout 1813 in Alabama and in parts of Georgia, and Jackson received reinforcements in early 1814. On March 27 he landed a decisive blow on the Red Sticks when he and between two thousand and three thousand troops, aided by Cherokee allies, marched to Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River, in central Alabama, to attack the Red Sticks who had barricaded themselves there. Jackson’s men broke through their defenses and after a day of fighting some nine hundred Red Sticks were dead, added to the thousand already killed in 1813.70 The Creeks later signed a treaty ceding millions of acres in Georgia and Alabama to the United States, making this a turning point not only in U.S.-Indian relations but also in western expansion. ([Location 3507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3507))
- Throughout the Red Stick War, Jackson kept Florida in his sights, in part because he wanted to stop the British from landing around Pensacola and to drive out the troops who were already there. In addition, he suspected that the Spanish were aiding British efforts against the United States, as well as harboring Red Sticks. ([Location 3513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3513))
- Jackson plotted his long-desired attack on Pensacola, finally marching into the town on November 6, 1814, with forty-one hundred soldiers and Indian allies, and seizing the Spanish forts. ([Location 3530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3530))
- The next day Jackson attacked Pensacola, and the Spanish capitulated. The following morning the British, who were using Fort Barrancas, blew it up and fled to their squadron anchored in the Gulf of Mexico. With the British and their Indian allies run out of town, Jackson’s mission came to a temporary end.78 He left for Mobile a few days later, and from there went to New Orleans, where the British fleet was thought to be landing. Jackson was in the city in time to defend it and defeat the British in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815—two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent that ended the War of 1812 had been signed in Europe.

- The 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty, also called the Transcontinental Treaty, was signed on February 22, 1819. Its key provisions were the cession of East and West Florida to the United States, with the new boundary being the Sabine River. From the river’s mouth in the Gulf of Mexico, the line moved north to N 32°, where the Sabine intersected with the Red River; from there, the line moved steplike in a northwest direction to the Arkansas River, going on to reach a final boundary of N 42°, with the westernmost limit being the Pacific. In exchange, the United States renounced claims to or any designs on territory southwest of the Sabine River, while also promising $5 million in compensation to Spanish subjects in Florida, though that would come later and, for many of the families in Florida at the time of the handover, not until after a long legal fight.

- Congress ratified the treaty in 1819, on the heels of the 1818 Anglo-American Convention, which established a boundary between the United States and Canada along N 49° as far west as the Rocky Mountains, freeing the Oregon territory beyond that for joint occupation. A pathway to the Pacific was opening up. ([Location 3649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3649))
- THE YEARS THAT followed the return of Fernando VII were fraught, as he struggled to keep his kingdom intact, at home and overseas. By 1820, Spain was in the throes of a constitutional second act, triggered by a mutiny in Cádiz of troops about to be sent to the Río de la Plata in Argentina to fight against revolutionaries. The soldiers turned on the king and demanded that he accept the 1812 constitution. Rebellions in support of this move erupted throughout Spanish cities.105 The king capitulated, and the period that followed, known as the Trienio Liberal, saw a restoration of the constitution. The liberals in power tried to reach out to the warring parts of the Americas and call for conciliation, but by 1820 it was too late.106 ([Location 3655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3655))
- The Trienio Liberal was brought to an end with a French invasion of Spain in 1823, backed by the Holy Alliance of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Their aim was to restore Fernando VII’s full authority, which they did. ([Location 3662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3662))
- In the Americas, however, a crushing defeat of royalists at the December 9, 1824, Battle of Ayacucho in Peru more or less brought an end to the wars of independence, with Spain defeated. Spanish America became a continent of republics, with the creation of Mexico, Gran Colombia (Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador after 1830), Peru, Chile, the United Provinces of Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua after 1840), Bolivia, and the United Provinces of Río de la Plata (Argentina).

- The transition from viceroyalty to independent nation was a profound rupture, as would be the transition from a worldview defined by the existence of a divinely appointed king and the Catholic Church to that of an independent republic. After a decade of upheaval and war, it would take some trial—and error—to work out how power was to be exercised in Mexico and how former subjects would transform themselves into citizens.

- A few months earlier, in December 1822, Antonio López de Santa Anna, a commander at Veracruz and an early supporter of Agustín I, had issued his Plan of Veracruz in opposition to the emperor, outlining a federal vision for Mexico. This was followed by the Plan of Casa Mata, calling for the restoration of Congress.114 A constitution was approved in 1824 that reflected these changes—in place of a king or emperor of the United States of Mexico (Estados Unidos Mexicanos), a president would lead the country and he would be held to account by a strong legislature in a federal system with regions divided into states and territories.

- Many of the men involved in political life also became associated with certain Masonic lodge orders that were powerful during the 1820s, with their memberships consisting of landowners, military officers, intellectuals, and other prominent people. Their divisions roughly mirrored the wider political ones. The Scottish Rite members, or escoceses, tended to be the Conservatives, who were in favor of centralist government, pro-Church, and pro-Spanish. The Rite of York, or yorkinos, represented the Liberals, who desired a federal government, and also wanted to reduce or eliminate the power of the clerics and of the remaining Spanish. At a time of such significant transition, beliefs and membership were subject to change, but for the moment, the distinct divisions of opinion on how best to proceed as a nation remained.

- This was the general climate in 1823 when President James Monroe set out what would be called his “doctrine” during his seventh annual message to Congress. He told the assembled legislators that “the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.”119 It was a sentiment that immediately took root and would continue to grow in scope over the decades to come.

- the region had a large and diverse population of Native Americans, including the Caddo, Wichita, and Lipan Apache, as well as the powerful Comanche, all of whom at various points had been involved in raids and conflicts with the Mexicans.7 The ongoing violence had proved an effective deterrent to extensive settlement in Texas, and some Mexican officials, distracted by their own independence struggle, did not realize that people from the United States were arriving.

- By the early 1820s some 167,000 settlers were inching toward the border, setting up in Louisiana and Arkansas, but with their eyes on Texas, while only 2,500 Mexicans (Tejanos) lived there. ([Location 3817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3817))
- One person willing to take his chances in Texas was Moses Austin. He had been born in Connecticut but made his fortune mining lead in Spanish Louisiana. He was experienced in dealing with Spain, having at an earlier point sworn his loyalty to the Spanish crown. Louisiana’s change from Spanish to U.S. control, coupled with the national financial crisis of 1819 that cost him his fortune, pushed him back into Spanish arms. He had heard that land in Texas was cheap, and he arrived in San Antonio in 1820.11 ([Location 3820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3820))
- Moses’s son, Stephen, decided to continue his father’s work, though it was a turbulent time in Texas: in 1821 Mexico had declared its independence, which the United States recognized the following year. Austin managed to secure the necessary permissions for the scheme to continue, and by 1824 a settlement on the Brazos River, or the Río de los Brazos de Dios as it was also known, was in place. It was called San Felipe de Austin and located about 150 miles east of the older town of San Antonio de Béxar. Austin had inherited his father’s empresario agreement, giving him the right to parcel out large tracts of land—which were cheap and could amount to thousands of acres—as well as to exact a payment from the settlers for his services.13 The area around the Brazos River seemed ideal. The soil was good and the river could transport crops down to the Gulf. Most of his “old three hundred”—the first group of settlers—arrived by 1824, spreading out in the area between the Brazos and Colorado Rivers.* ([Location 3830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3830))
- Although the Anglos did not have to become Mexican citizens, they did have to take an oath of loyalty and profess that they would convert to Catholicism. This initial period of settlement was marked by a degree of social and cultural mixing, and there were even incentives for this, such as giving an Anglo man extra land if he married a Mexican woman.

- English-speakers began to learn Spanish, and Spanish-speakers to learn English.

- More than two thousand miles of land separated Monterey and Mexico City. To the Californios, or Spanish Californians, their fellow Mexicans were almost like foreigners, though they themselves hardly constituted the majority in what they considered their land.27 As late as 1830, California was estimated to have around ten thousand Mexicans, against a Native American population of ninety-eight thousand.

- The Mexican government landed a further blow in 1833 with the Secularization Act, accelerating the distribution of mission land to settlers and assimilated Indians, and carried out in California under the watch of its governor, General José María Figueroa.30 To settle the contentious issue of dividing the land, he stipulated that half of the mission properties should go to Indians, but after his death in 1835 his plan was ignored, and little land passed into Native American hands, going instead to elite Californios who became large landholders, adding to their ranchos.

- Although the European population of California remained small, trade was turning it into a cosmopolitan place, as ships from New England and Asia called at its ports, eager for cattle hides from its ranchos. Russians, too, had continued their drive along the coast, setting up a colony about one hundred miles north of San Francisco, funded by the Russian-American Company and thought to be built with the help of the Alutiiq people in 1812.

- To Dana, though, such riches were lost on the Californios: “In hands of an enterprising people, what a country this might be!”39 He returned to Massachusetts in 1836 and published the diary, which became a huge hit and turned the public gaze west, to this little-known Pacific frontier.

- As part of Spain’s empire, Mexico had an estimated two hundred thousand enslaved Africans brought during the entire colonial period. However, much of the labor throughout New Spain was undertaken by Indians and was waged. In addition, the overall economy was not as geared toward export monocrop commodities like sugar, tobacco, or cotton as were economies in the Caribbean and the southern United States. By the 1820s, most Africans and their descendants in Mexico had merged into the wider, and free, casta society, leaving slave numbers low by the time of independence.

- As Mexican forces were driving the Spanish from Tampico, farther north along the Gulf the Anglo cotton farmers were enjoying a boom, annually exporting between 350,000 and 450,000 pounds of the crop, which represented a doubling of production from only a few years earlier.48 Around the same time, in September 1829, the Mexican government abolished slavery and granted freedom to existing slaves. The following year, the federal government passed laws to stop the arrival of further immigrants from the United States, though other settlers, such as Germans and the Irish, were permitted, and even encouraged with cash advances.49 The government also pushed for more Mexican immigration to these outlying areas, while calling for the “prevention of further introduction of slaves.” ([Location 3957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3957))
- This fueled more animosity between the slaveholders and the Mexican authorities but did little to stop more Anglos from arriving. The military in the north was not strong enough to monitor or to stop them, and so the Anglo population doubled between 1830 and 1834, despite the restrictions.

- Concerns lingered in the Anglo colonies and in October 1832 some residents organized a convention, held in San Felipe de Austin, to outline their grievances. They met again the following year, in April 1833, and among the delegates was the former Tennessee congressman and governor Sam Houston, who had become involved with land speculation in Texas after quitting the governorship of Tennessee in 1829. He had resurfaced in Nacogdoches in 1832, when he joined the heated discussions about Texas. ([Location 3980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=3980))
- a Constitution of the Republic of Texas on March 17. This document outlined a government not dissimilar from the United States’ in structure, with a separate legislature, executive, and judiciary. Slavery was protected, with a provision that “congress shall pass no laws to prohibit emigrants from bringing their slaves into the republic with them … nor shall congress have the power to emancipate slaves,” and no free person of color “either in whole or part, shall be permitted to reside permanently in the republic, without the consent of congress.” ([Location 4129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4129))
- Known as the “Bear Flag” party, the group declared California a republic, and Frémont became the group’s leader a short time later. Soon afterward, they were subsumed into the larger California Battalion, which included the frontiersman Kit Carson. By July, a U.S. Navy ship arrived, sending men ashore and raising the U.S. flag in Monterey on July 7, and by August U.S. forces had taken San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles, though that was not the end of the fighting.

- Throughout this period, ideas about Anglo-Saxon superiority crystallized, bolstered by a racialized field of scientific inquiry that would end up placing Anglos at the top of the evolutionary pile but also building on the foundation of prejudices laid by Anglos in Texas. Whiteness in the United States became bound up with the idea of manifest destiny and the providence that the Anglo-Protestants were somehow chosen to spread themselves across the continent. Victory against Mexico was but one more step along that road. ([Location 4456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4456))
- In Washington, a young first-term Illinois congressman, Abraham Lincoln, criticized the government over the whole debacle in December 1847. In what became known as the “spot resolutions,” Lincoln demanded to know if the “particular spot on which the blood of our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil,” a question to which he was given no answer.

- Two months later, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ceding 51 percent of Mexico’s territory to the United States, with the Río Grande set as the border. Besides California, Texas, and New Mexico, the 525,000 square miles would later become part or all of the states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.

- By 1850, California introduced a tax that required any miner who was not a U.S. citizen to pay a license fee of $20 a month. This led to immediate protests, and it was rewritten the following year, this time exempting white Europeans but not Mexicans or other Latin Americans. Instead, they were objects of assaults and even lynchings in the aftermath of what was known as the “Great Greaser Extermination Meeting” held in the summer of 1850 by Anglos in Sonora. As a result, the number of Hispanic miners dropped from fifteen thousand in 1849 to around five thousand by the end of the following year.16 The Native American population fared badly as well, plummeting to thirty thousand by the 1870s.17 Many California Indians were pushed off their land by speculators or prospectors, or exploited as workers in the mines. Legislation was aimed at their displacement—Indians who were “loitering” could be pressed into a work gang for months at a time.

- When California brought all of this to the attention of Washington for confirmation, it provoked a political crisis. Another bargain was struck, once more brokered by Henry Clay, and known as the Compromise of 1850. This was a series of measures that allowed California to join the union as a free state but created territorial governments in Utah and New Mexico, which at this point included Arizona, with no mention of slavery. The other parts of the compromise abolished the slave trade in the District of Columbia, although slavery itself was still permitted in the capital. To appease southerners, the controversial Fugitive Slave Act was passed, requiring free citizens in any part of the country to aid in the recovery of runaway slaves. After these deals were made, California joined the union on September 9, 1850. ([Location 4686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4686))
- Thousands of these “squatter” migrants who arrived in California brought with them the belief that they were entitled to land now that it was part of the United States. In addition, many were supporters of Free-Soil sentiments and considered the earlier Mexican system as semifeudal and, correspondingly, of Indians and Mexicans as unfree, nonwhite labor.26 The squatters looked to the legal system to support their views, arguing that the Mexican land distribution system was a relic of an older order that gave power to the wealthy through the concentration of landowning.

- The squatters erected fences, built makeshift dwellings, and tried to establish their right to the land through filing preemption claims.29 In doing so, they stoked the growing anger of the Californios whose land they occupied. Their behavior also provoked other Anglo settlers and, at times, the government, both of whom often disapproved of the squatters’ methods.30 At various points throughout the 1850s and into the early 1860s violent clashes erupted between squatters and the authorities, as in 1850 in Sacramento, and in 1861 in San ([Location 4719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4719))
- In the end, the Supreme Court came down on the side of Frémont, ruling that his 44,787-acre grant was valid, and in doing so protected the interests of other large landholders, preventing their territory from being ceded to the public domain and into the hands of squatters.

- He would witness the metamorphosis of the village of Los Angeles into a bustling city. In 1850, it had a population of only sixteen hundred, but by the early decades of the next century it soared to over a million.42 He experienced the arrival of not just Anglos but people from all over the world, and saw at first hand the difficulties of the transition to U.S. statehood, as Californios attempted to realign their social and political status.

- Although California was a free state, it had lured many people from the southern slaveholding areas, some of whom had arrived before statehood. They formed alliances with prominent Californios, drawn together by shared interests in landownership and in maintaining a certain social order.44 These men were Democrats, and their faction was known as the “Chivalry.” The Democrats had gained power in California, and in addition to the Chivalry, they had some initial success in courting the support of the squatters in the early 1850s.45 In addition to politics, with many of the southerners continuing to advocate the spread of slavery into the West, their Californio allies also took part in lynchings and other vigilante activity.

- He directed his ire at measures like the 1855 Vagrancy Act, better known as the “Greaser” Act, because it targeted Mexicans as well as Native Americans. Under this statute, anyone found “loitering” risked arrest and possible forced labor.

- Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo stipulated that citizenship be transferred to all people in the new territories, its application would not be so straightforward. Under Mexican law, mestizos and Indians were citizens. This did not mean they escaped social and economic prejudice, but they were entitled to Mexican citizenship.60 In the United States, however, full citizenship was reserved for free white people. A problem officials now faced was that there was no legal racial vocabulary for Mexicans. They were neither “black” nor “white.” Native Americans in this period were considered to be part of another “nation” and were excluded, though underpinning this were racialized ideas as well.

- The forty-eight delegates in charge of drawing up the constitution at the 1849 convention had an average residency in California of two years, and only eight were Californios. Their definition of “white” remained ambiguous, though the document’s exclusion of black or Indian people was clear.61 The problem came in judging the mestizo population, who constituted the majority of Mexican Californians. No one knew what a “white Mexican” was, and no law specified how that was to be determined.62 In some areas this left mestizos claiming their “Spanish” heritage in order to be granted whiteness, while Indians often claimed to be mestizo so they could claim citizenship. ([Location 4835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4835))
- Groups like the Know-Nothings espoused anti-immigrant and often anti-Catholic sentiments, which would also feed into ideas about Hispanics. Their Catholicism was considered suspect and at odds with the Protestant Anglo-Saxon culture that dominated political and cultural life east of the Mississippi River.65 Whereas whiteness was linked to “civilization” and productivity, brown Mexicans were always cast as “lazy” and backward.

- The New Mexico territory initially extended full rights to the Pueblo Indians, under the terms of the 1848 treaty. This was gradually stripped away over the subsequent years, as more Anglos arrived in the region and there were legal challenges over the Pueblos’ status, culminating in an 1876 Supreme Court decision that overturned their right to citizenship.67 Once Arizona became a territory separate from New Mexico in 1863, it, too, passed laws similar to California’s, limiting the political participation of Mexicans and Native Americans.68 Likewise, Texas granted citizenship to “white” Mexicans, forcing any Mexican arriving in Texas after 1845 to somehow prove his of her “whiteness.” ([Location 4850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4850))

- Yet such assimilation was often not enough. It took the ruling in In re Rodriguez in Texas in 1897 to reaffirm the right of all Mexicans in Texas to be full citizens. The case had been brought in 1896—the same year that segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson was upheld by the Supreme Court—by Ricardo Rodríguez, who was born in Mexico.71 He wanted U.S. citizenship, which would allow him to vote, but was denied it on the grounds that he was an “Indian” and thus not eligible. ([Location 4867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4867))
- The argument against him invoked rulings supporting the claim that the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the United States, applied only to black and white people, and, based on his physical appearance, under which “he may be classed with copper-colored or red men,” Rodríguez was neither. Nor did he appear to be a true Indian, according to the judge, because “he knows nothing of the Aztecs or Toltecs.” ([Location 4871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4871))
- The ruling, rather than contesting this interpretation of race or ethnicity, instead turned to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. If Mexicans in the ceded territory had been “whitened” to be made into citizens in the aftermath of 1848, then the same right could be extended toward Mexican immigrants. While the ruling went some way toward securing the right to naturalize, it only further muddied the question of whiteness.

- For instance, in 1855 the state legislature in California appropriated school funds in proportion to the number of white children. Three years later, a series of bills segregated schools, with Anglo children put in separate facilities from black, Hispanic, Indian, and Chinese children. This culminated in the California School Law (1870), which was aimed at the growing Chinese community but affected all nonwhite children.75 It would take decades and many more court battles to desegregate California’s schools.

- In Texas, Mexicans confronted increasing hostility from Anglos, including seizure of their property. People who were unwilling to bow to demands could find a violent resolution awaiting them.76 From 1848 until 1928 at least 597 known lynchings of Mexicans occurred—though estimates range into the thousands—and people lived in fear of mob violence.77 These killings also occurred in places where there was little oversight by law enforcement or, indeed, active collusion.78 This was not unique to Texas, though it had the highest number of such killings in this period, with 232, to California’s 143 and New Mexico’s 87.

- A number of bills concerning homesteading were put forward and in 1853, the Democratic senator Stephen Douglas proposed legislation that would become the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Under the prevailing idea of “popular sovereignty,” settlers in these two territories would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery. This part of the territory was north of the line established by the Missouri Compromise, which would be violated by a vote in favor of slavery. The 1854 bill split the Whig Party, with southern members voting for it, and northerners against, leaving the party in tatters. Southerners ended up joining the Democratic Party, and northern Whigs signed up for the new Republican Party.

- They were known as filibusters, an adaptation of the Dutch word vrijbuiter, or pirate, and as filibusteros in Spanish.* These men were land pirates, launching expeditions in search of territory. They acted without any official sanction—as many of the Anglo “adventurers” had done in Texas in the 1830s—and, depending on the mission and the result, a blind eye was often turned to their exploits.

- In 1851, a Venezuelan-born general, Narciso López, led an expedition from the United States to free Cuba from Spanish rule. Although most of Latin America was long independent by that point, this sugar island was not. It had continued to cling to Spain, in part out of fear of a slave rebellion. As the decades of the nineteenth century wore on, however, irritation with the colonial regime grew; many Cubans left the island and, from abroad, began to make plans for independence. Some wanted Cuba to be an independent republic; others wanted it to be annexed to the United States. The latter group enjoyed the support of southern slaveholders. ([Location 4943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4943))
- The U.S. government was also interested in the island; successive presidents had made offers to buy it, but Spain refused—Cuba’s sugar exports were too valuable to forgo. In fact, Spain had been refusing for quite some time. As early as 1810, the envoy William Shaler was sent to “feel the pulse of Cuba” concerning the “incorporation of that island with the United States,” though nothing came of the visit.91 Later, Polk tried to buy the island for $100 million in 1848. Spain rejected the offer, but the idea that Cuba was a natural fit for the United States persisted. ([Location 4948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4948))
- A couple of years later, in 1853, President Franklin Pierce offered $130 million in another unsuccessful attempt to buy the island. The following year a communiqué between U.S. diplomats was leaked from a conference in Ostend, Belgium, saying the United States “ought, if practicable, to purchase Cuba with as little delay as possible.”96 The island had become “an unceasing danger, and a permanent cause of anxiety and alarm” because Spain failed, in the eyes of the United States, to exercise sufficient control over it. Both the island and the United States were slaveholding societies, and this fed the diplomats’ unease. ([Location 4968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=4968))
- The Civil War was not limited to the eastern United States: Mexican-Americans in the West would find themselves drawn into this conflict, as would Californios. Some Hispanic soldiers sided with the Union and organized themselves into Company C of the First Battalion of Native Cavalry, which patrolled the Arizona and New Mexico territories, and the California Battalion of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry ended up in the heart of battle, fighting in Virginia.

- By the summer of 1861, the Confederacy’s Lieutenant Colonel John R.

- However, there were no doubt larger political considerations—New Mexico’s desired statehood—that factored into the creation of the code. It provided a way for New Mexican politicians to try to appeal to the existing racial order, presenting themselves as “white,” through the code’s measures, such as its prohibiting black people from marrying or even testifying against a “white” person in New Mexico.105 Before the outbreak of war, the passage of the code attracted the support of southern congressmen, who in turn pledged to help New Mexico become a state.106 Two years later, and with the Confederates now in New Mexico, the territory’s legislature did an about-face, revoking the slave code and making clear its support of the Union in December 1861.107 ([Location 5017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5017))

Around twelve hundred Confederates were forced to retreat by thirteen hundred Union troops. The Union’s success was in part due to a raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Chavez, to set fire to a train of supply wagons.

Spain reannexed the Dominican Republic in 1861, after the island had suffered a number of internal conflicts, occupying it until 1865.113 Around the same time, another European intervention took place in Mexico, though this involved not its former colonial ruler, Spain, but rather the French.

- The Mexican-American War did little to remedy matters, and there had been more political changes in the decades that followed, including another civil conflict, known as the Reform War (1858–60), triggered by a series of new laws that stripped away ecclesiastical powers and confiscated Church property, causing resentments that were exacerbated by a new constitution in 1857 that did not make Catholicism the national religion.

- Conservatives within Mexico had been discussing, if not explicitly advocating, the return to monarchy since the 1840s.119 They saw constitutional monarchy as a way to restore order after what they considered to be the failure of republican Liberal rule, as well as a means to protect their privileges and restore the Church’s position. It was a vision of a return to a hierarchical, Catholic Mexico. ([Location 5069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5069))
- France, under Napoleon III, had been casting itself as part—and protector—of l’Amérique latine, a broad “Latin” America that was composed of a “Latin race.” This expression had already been in use, but the French adopted it with enthusiasm.120 For France, the “Latin” connection was the common origin of the languages of France, Spain, and Portugal, and their Catholicism, which was considered to be as much a culturally unifying force as Protestantism was for the Anglo-Saxon world.121 France’s global ambitions had been reignited in this period, and they reached far beyond this “Latin” sphere, into places like Southeast Asia (French Indochina). In the Americas, the situation in Mexico provided a favorable opportunity to add to France’s handful of Caribbean islands.

- In 1862, Napoleon III sent around thirty thousand soldiers to Mexico to place the Austrian on its throne.122 Juárez was not going to let this happen without a fight, and Mexico won a key victory in Puebla, on May 5, 1862, which was later commemorated by the holiday Cinco de Mayo.

- One French pamphlet, written by Michel Chevalier, a leading proponent of France’s “Latin” ideology, claimed that the purpose of the war had been “to aid the Mexicans in establishing, according to their own free will and choice, a government which may have some chance of stability.”124 Alongside this, France wanted to “oppose the absorption of Southern America by Northern America,” as well as “oppose the degradation of the Latin race.” Thus, to Chevalier, it was “the interests which compel France to sympathize with the Confederate States which have led our banners up to the walls of Mexico.” ([Location 5087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5087))
- With the Union victory in 1865, hundreds of Confederate soldiers left the South and headed to Mexico. One letter from Sterling Price—a general who had also fought in the Mexican-American War—spoke of the “greatest kindness” of the emperor in receiving him. Maximilian issued a decree that September allowing the ex-soldiers to settle around Veracruz, where five hundred thousand acres would be given over for the development of Confederate colonies.

- Guerrilla warfare was continuous, aided by the covert sale of arms and ammunition from the United States to Juárez and the Liberals.130 A frustrated Napoleon III decided to pull his troops out of Mexico, taking nine thousand in the autumn of 1866 and the rest over the course of the following year. Facing the removal of the forces that propped up his regime, Maximilian considered abdication but decided to fight Juárez, backed by Mexican royalists who were outnumbered. Maximilian was captured and imprisoned by May 1867. He was tried for treason and executed by firing squad on June 19.131 ([Location 5104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5104))
- Juárez returned to power and the Confederates in Mexico realized they had once again chosen the wrong side. Those who stayed in Mexico risked incurring the wrath of Juárez and attacks by his supporters, who wanted to rid the country of meddling foreigners. Many experienced raids or harassment from their angry Mexican neighbors. Most decided to leave, though a handful took their chances and stayed on.

- For many U.S. politicians, Mexico represented the antithesis of a functioning nation. By 1876, however, some people began to fear that the United States could suffer decades of similar turbulence, and this manifested itself in the brief “Mexicanization” panic. This was a shorthand and pejorative way of expressing the fear that the Civil War had weakened the nation to the point where it, like Mexico, might lurch from one internal conflict to the next.133 The term also implied endless local corruption at the ballot box.134 That year’s November presidential election between the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and the Democrat Samuel Tilden was disputed, and Hayes wasn’t declared the winner until the following March.

- Such problems were not limited to Mexico, the article argued: “Among the ways in which these habits are destroyed or the growth of them prevented is the practice of treating the political party opposed to your own as a band of criminals or conspirators against the government.

- The trains began to run north and south, too. By late 1882, the Arizona and New Mexico Railway connected with the Sonora Railway, becoming the first line to cross the border with Mexico.144 The shipping of goods and the movement of people became easier, and this led to economic expansion on both sides of the border. The trains transformed their surroundings, with all the tunneling, blasting, and clearing they required. They had a similar impact on the people, as towns sprang up and work moved away from ranching.

- some of the individuals who would become the state’s most ardent proponents were not Californios but Anglos from the East.

- He presented a strange story, one not identifiable if viewed from the Tejano or Californio—to say nothing of the Native American—perspective. Nowhere in his article did he mention one of the most important factors to have allowed this “colonization of the Great West”: the gain of millions of acres after the Mexican-American War. In his account of the battle to civilize, not a single mention of the Spanish or even the Mexican past appears. There are no mission churches, no presidios, and no ranchos. The relationship between Hispanics and Native Americans before the Anglos or Europeans crossed the Mississippi is wiped away as well, and nothing is made of the active and preexisting hubs of civilization, as represented by everything from a Pueblo village to a mission church in California. Instead, he championed a taming of a uniformly hostile wilderness and Indian “savagery,” only after which the institutions of American life and its economy could take root.

- A small neighborhood of cigar factories and workers’ cottages might seem an incongruous place to launch a liberation struggle, but for the nascent Cuban community Ybor City would become one of the central organizing points of the junta to free the island. The neighborhood’s evolution into the “cradle of Cuban liberty” was not what Vicente Martínez Ybor had in mind when he decided to relocate his cigar factory to a tract of sandy land to the west of the small town of Tampa in 1885.

- During these later decades of the nineteenth century at least one hundred thousand Cubans left the island for the United States, Europe, and Latin American countries.10 The wealthiest emigrants went to Europe, the middle-class professionals to the large cities of the U.S. East Coast, and workers to Florida.11 Some sixteen thousand Cubans came to the United States between 1886 and 1890 alone.

- Although hierarchies and discrimination had long existed in Cuba on the basis of skin color, with darker-skinned people on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder and lighter-skinned people among the elite, Cubans in the United States were often not prepared for the level of segregation they encountered in the Jim Crow South. Some Cubans discovered they had been classified as “black” and so were forced to endure the treatment that accompanied this. By the end of the century, the 1896 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Homer Plessy, a Louisiana creole who sat in a white railway car and was arrested because he was one-eighth black, established the legal precedent of “separate but equal.” Black Cubans were not exempt. In Florida, many of them found themselves living in places apart from lighter-skinned Cubans, and they were also forced to socialize in different worlds.

- While Cubans were seeking better economic opportunities in Florida or New York, U.S. capital had been flowing into Cuban sugar—by this point for decades, with significant activity starting again after the end of the U.S. Civil War, spurred on in part by technological developments in sugar refining.19 Although the Ten Years’ War caused some disruption, it was clear that a free Cuba could be a very profitable one. The U.S. backers began to show their support for Cuba libre by joining the Cuban American League, set up by the New York businessman William O. McDowell in 1892.20 Spain’s finances had long been devastated by conflict, and the Spanish had little to spend on rebuilding Cuba after the war. Planters in Cuba thus took credit from U.S. banks, or investors bought plantations from planters who were unable to recover from the drop in sugar prices at the beginning of the 1880s.21 This was further aided by the 1890 McKinley Tariff, which removed the duty on raw sugar imported to the United States, giving Cuban producers extra impetus to rebuild their plantations, often with foreign help.22 Soon, family estates were being taken over by U.S. banks, though at the same time many planters were trying to obtain U.S. citizenship in order to protect their interests.23 The commercial ties between the United States and Cuba began to tighten.

- The United States and Cuba were also becoming linked by something that aroused a bit more passion than talk of tariffs: baseball. The brothers Nemesio and Ernesto Guilló, who had studied in Alabama, are credited with being the first to bring the game to the island, establishing the Havana Baseball Club in 1868. The first game between two provincial teams took place in 1874, and by 1878 the Cuban League of Professional Baseball was up and running.25 The enthusiasm was based on more than just a love of playing or watching the sport. For Cubans, an important aspect of the game was the team itself, a symbol for building a new nation, as contrasted against the individual performance of Spanish bullfighting.

- IN 1894, THE United States introduced the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act, imposing a 40 percent duty on imported sugar to help domestic production and wrecking any trade advantage Cuba enjoyed. Sugar exports collapsed, the cost of imports rose, and frustration with Spanish trade policies reached a boil.32 At the same time, Cubans in exile and on the island were now ready to try again for independence. In 1895, under the organization of Martí, the War of Independence started, and uprisings took place throughout the island.

- More directly for the United States, the business interests of some of its citizens were being destroyed—one of the revolutionary tactics was to burn sugarcane fields.36 By 1898, after three years of war on the island, coupled with the change in sugar tariffs, New York merchants complained that they were losing $100 million a year in lost or disrupted trade with Cuba.37 Businesses in cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore began to lobby William McKinley, who became U.S. president in 1897, to find a way to end the costly conflict.

- In a bid to avert a war but solve the crisis, President McKinley made one final attempt in January 1898 to buy Cuba for $300 million, which Spain refused.42 Around the same time rumors reached Washington that four German warships in the Caribbean might be there to take Cuba as part of a secret deal with Spain.43 Public and political opinion about how to proceed was still divided when President McKinley sent the battleship USS Maine from Key West to Havana on January 24, 1898, in what was presented as a peaceful visit, though Hearst’s New York Journal exclaimed, “Our Flag in Havana at Last” in the next day’s edition.

- in late March an official U.S. inquiry concluded that while an exact cause could not be found, it most likely was the fault of a Spanish mine outside the ship.47 Whatever the reason, the destruction of the Maine was now a useful casus belli.

- The United States declared war on Spain on April 25, and its opening attack followed less than a week later, though not in Cuba but in the Philippines, which also had remained under Spanish rule. The United States attacked in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, using ships already in the Pacific, and sank the Spanish squadron. By early July, a joint resolution had passed Congress for the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands because of their strategic importance and use as a naval base.

- Around three thousand troops that had been fighting in Cuba were sent to Puerto Rico in July, landing near the southern town of Guánica on the twenty-fifth. They moved inland, stopping at the city of Ponce, where a proclamation declared that the purpose of their invasion was to bring a “banner of freedom.” Puerto Rico was soon under U.S. control. By August 12, the entire “splendid little war,” as Secretary of State John Hay was said to have called it, came to an end. The humiliation for Spain was complete. Its once vast empire whittled away by independence movements and now by war with the United States, it was left with only a few small protectorates in North and West Africa.

- In the end, Cuba would have its independence in 1902, though not without the United States erecting a few more barriers along the way, the largest of which took the form of the 1901 Platt Amendment. This legislation reflected the ongoing U.S. distrust of Cubans and set out a number of new demands as part of a larger bill to end the military occupation of the island. It was crafted to leave U.S. interests protected and U.S. influence undiminished. One key stipulation obliged Cuba to lease land to the United States for a naval station; today Guantánamo Bay remains a base for the U.S. Navy. The amendment also allowed the United States to exercise its “right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence,” which was vague enough for a wide degree of interpretation.73 ([Location 5658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5658))
- To offset the financial pain that some landowners were experiencing, U.S. officials at first implemented a number of measures, such as delayed debt collection, abolition of certain duties and taxes, and a moratorium on plantation foreclosure.76 These provided some relief, but at the same time it was clear there were bargains to be had.77 By 1905, around $50 million in land purchases had been made, with some thirteen thousand U.S. investors owning titles.78 Between 1903 and 1919, some forty-four thousand people from the United States emigrated to Cuba, by then an island of 1.5 million people.79 By 1920, North American sugar interests were producing 63 percent of the total crop.

- The Mexicans in Texas or New Mexico had citizenship, or at least the right to obtain it, conferred on them. By contrast, the situation in Puerto Rico was unclear. In the 1901 Downes v. Bidwell case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution did not have the same application on the island as it did on the mainland. As a result, Justice Edward White introduced the doctrine of territorial nonincorporation; in domestic terms, Puerto Ricans were foreign; in international terms they belonged to United States. ([Location 5726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5726))
- Put into the same category of “alien” as other foreigners, Puerto Ricans in 1902 had to enter via Ellis Island, which at that time was under the commissionership of William Williams. He was an advocate of strict enforcement, and the rate of people turned away had doubled in his first year.94 Of special interest to him were the people thought likely to need recourse to public funds, or, as it was put in the case of González, “likely to become a public charge.”95 Under this regime, unmarried mothers or women who were pregnant were taken for further questioning, while single women had to be collected by a family member. Once González’s pregnancy was revealed, she was pulled aside, although family members were present to meet her. Officials asked whether her relatives were “able, willing and legally bound” to give her support. ([Location 5734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5734))
- The case reached the Supreme Court by 1903, and after two months of hearings and deliberations it issued a unanimous ruling that the word “alien” could not be used in relation to Puerto Ricans. It did not make them full citizens, but it meant they could have more freedom to travel and live on the mainland.

- Puerto Rico came a step closer to this desired autonomy in March 1917 with the Jones-Shafroth Act, though Muñoz Rivera died in late 1916, before its passage. This legislation created an elected bicameral legislature for the island, giving Puerto Ricans a greater degree of local democracy. It also made them U.S. citizens, partially incorporating them into the wider nation while also reminding them of the limits of self-rule on the island.

- the Colombian Congress was not pleased with the terms of the Hay-Herrán Treaty that U.S. and Colombian ministers had drawn up: $10 million for a ninety-nine-year lease and an annual payment of $250,000. The Colombian politicians knew the canal would be worth more and Colombia’s Congress refused to ratify the treaty. The United States was forced to find another way. It enticed separatists to foment a “revolution” to break away from Colombia, establish a new nation, and permit the construction of the canal. By 1903, with the backing of U.S. gunships, the Republic of Panama was proclaimed, and by 1914 the canal was open.

- The year after the creation of Panama, President Theodore Roosevelt outlined in his annual address to Congress of 1904 what became known as the Roosevelt Corollary. No longer satisfied with the strictures of the Monroe Doctrine of more than eighty years before, Roosevelt’s described this new vision as the United States’ desire “to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship.”113 Yet those who fell out of line might “ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.” ([Location 5799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=5799))
- In the years since the end of the conflict in 1848, fifteen new states had joined the union. The only territories in the continental United States that remained at the turn of the century were New Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma, and what was known as Indian territory.

- Of this population, around 20,000 were Native Americans, and the majority of the remaining people were, as the pamphlet explained, “native whites, often called for convenience ‘Mexicans.’”121 They were also known as nativos, U.S. citizens but of Mexican descent. The press and politicians often described New Mexican nativos as not “ready” for the responsibilities of statehood, prompting supporters to rise to the territory’s defense.

- Alongside this was the implication that New Mexicans were unfit for statehood because they were, in the racial terms of the time, mixed. Out of these charges emerged one line of defense espoused by pro-statehood Anglo and Hispanic leaders: that New Mexicans were of “Spanish”—that is, European—blood. This led to a historical pronouncements and a blurred fantasy past—not unlike that of the Californios—bolstered by Anglo defenders, such as LeBaron Bradford Prince, a judge who also served as a territorial governor. Prince claimed that while there were many Pueblo villages in New Mexico, “no marriage or similar connections take place between the races.” Prince, who was born in New York and moved to New Mexico in 1878, was a tireless champion of statehood and later wrote books about New Mexico’s history, but during the statehood debate he helped lay a foundation for a “Spanish American” identity.

- the forced sale of Church land and communal peasant holdings. It was a move that benefited urban professionals, regional elites, and smaller private landowners who were in a position to buy up these assets but angered the Church and peasant communities.6 Intermittent rebellions took place from that point through the 1870s. Díaz had, at the start of his presidency, given the appearance of favoring village communities over the landed elite, but that ended up being not quite the case. His drive to modernize meant bringing railroads to Mexico, which entailed buying up land, including that held by villages, sparking further regional insurrections that were suppressed in the 1880s.

- Over the course of the Porfiriato, community landholdings dropped to 2 percent of national land, down from 25 percent. Foreigners held 90 percent of the incorporated value of Mexican industry and 150 million acres of land. Of that, U.S. investors were the owners of 70 percent of the industrial wealth and 130 million acres of land.

- The United States continued to watch with concern, both at the border and farther south, not least because Zapata and his Zapatistas were raiding U.S. investors’ large landholdings. Many Americans living in Mexico were running back north. At one point, President Taft sent the USS Buford to evacuate U.S. citizens from the Pacific coast. He also put an embargo on selling weapons to Mexico. ([Location 6025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6025))
- Huerta would prove to be a dangerous ally. He orchestrated behind the scenes—with the involvement of the U.S. ambassador Henry Lane Wilson—Madero’s eventual assassination on February 22, 1913, along with that of his vice president, José María Pino Suárez, which ended a particularly violent episode known as the Decena Trágica (Tragic Ten Days). ([Location 6031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6031))
- Huerta remained in power, despite Wilson’s demand that he resign.39 By February 1914 Wilson lifted the arms embargo, allowing ammunition to reach Villa and Carranza.40 Then, in April, after receiving reports of the arrest of U.S. sailors in the Mexican port of Tampico and news of a German ship bound for Veracruz loaded with arms for Huerta’s troops, Wilson decided to act. On April 21, the U.S. president sent in the Navy, and fifteen ships bombarded Veracruz, leaving hundreds dead, most of them innocent civilians. Afterward thirty-five hundred U.S. troops went ashore to occupy the city.41 The return of the United States to Mexican soil—especially to the same city assaulted in the Mexican-American War—was greeted with a unanimous cry of outrage.

- New factions were emerging, and they would lead to more violence. In very general terms, Carranza and Obregón represented the interests of some regional elites, the middle classes, merchants, and other professionals, while Villa and Zapata claimed the support of the working class, including the miners and vaqueros, as well as the poorer agricultural workers, smallholders, and peasants. ([Location 6089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6089))
- Carranza refused to step down, and so Gutiérrez put Villa in charge of leading the attack on him, and Zapata also followed suit. Carranza retreated to Veracruz, while a tenuous “Conventionalist” alliance of Villa and Zapata, with Gutiérrez as an interim president, was formed.

- The plan’s objective was for Mexicans and Tejanos to stage a rebellion against Anglo rule on February 20 with a “Liberating army for Races and Peoples,” which included Hispanics, African-Americans, and even Japanese. It proclaimed independence from “Yankee tyranny which has held us in iniquitous slavery since remote times.”59 They wanted to take back territory of which “the Republic of Mexico was robbed in a most perfidious manner by North American imperialism” in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, and even Colorado.60 Other parts of the plan included killing all Anglo men over the age of sixteen, giving black people their own republic, and returning some ancestral territory to Native Americans.

- bands of men, ranging in number from twenty-five to more than one hundred, attacked property, infrastructure such as railway lines, and livestock throughout the summer of 1915.61 Retaliation in the Río Grande valley at the hands of the Texas Rangers was ferocious. Although the plan may have attracted as many as three thousand supporters, the Rangers’ hunt for perpetrators resulted in the deaths of many innocent Mexicans and Tejanos wrongly charged with involvement. The Rangers explained the violence away in terms of self-defense in the face of racial warfare. Lynchings and executions became common and, in addition, rumors spread that the Germans and Japanese were arming the insurgents.62 According to some estimates, around three hundred people were killed, though others place the number of dead in the thousands. ([Location 6139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6139))
- By October 1915, Carranza received the recognition he wanted from the United States. As he dealt with a series of crippling strikes in the main cities, including the capital, Obregón was leading Constitutionalist troops into victories against Villa during 1915.65 In November, Villa tried to mount another round of attacks, at Agua Prieta, just south of the border at Douglas, Arizona. The Constitutionalists were able defeat him, this time in part because the United States allowed Mexican reinforcements to enter via Texas and Arizona.66 ([Location 6151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6151))
- Wilson’s recognition of Carranza had been a blow to Villa, who began to make more raids in the Río Grande valley.68 Villa also reneged on his promises to leave U.S. interests alone. In January 1916, Villa’s men stopped a train near Santa Ysabel, Chihuahua, that had U.S. mining engineers on board: at least sixteen men were taken off the train and murdered. ([Location 6161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6161))
- Carranza was also trying to bring together a new constitution, and he gathered delegates in the city of Querétaro, in central Mexico, in December 1916 to produce one, which they did by the end of January 1917. Attempting to curb regional power, this constitution—still in use today—put the unity of the federal nation at its core, along with a strong presidency. In addition, the constitution pushed the anticlericalism of the 1857 constitution even further, with religious education outlawed, among other measures. The document’s Article 123 established a number of labor laws considered to be among the most progressive in the world at the time, including the right of workers to organize and strike, as well as improvements to working conditions such as limits on hours and days worked in a week.

- A plan had existed for some time to erect a six-foot wire fence, at the instigation of the municipal leader of Nogales, who ended up being killed in the battle. Afterward, it was carried out by U.S. officials, who also supported a plan to reduce crossings to two designated points. At the time, the fence was considered to be not antagonistic but rather a cooperative measure that local administrators in both countries supported.

- In late January 1918, a band of Rangers rode into the west Texas village of Porvenir, not far from the Río Grande. They were on a mission to find out who was behind raids on a nearby ranch that had resulted in a number of Anglo and Mexican deaths. They believed the answer might be found in the village where, they claimed, the residents were acting on behalf of Mexican ranchers who lived across the river. They arrested 15 men in the early hours of the morning, marched them to a nearby bluff, and executed them on the spot. The rest of the village, around 140 people, fled to Mexico. Five Rangers were later fired, but no one faced criminal indictments. ([Location 6233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6233))
- Mexicans in Texas also had to contend with the Ku Klux Klan, which would raid labor camps, drag people from their tents, and assault them. The Klansmen did not limit their activities to Texas, and there were reports of KKK violence as far west as San ([Location 6243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6243))
- Without justice, and often without newspaper coverage, murders, executions, and lynchings slipped from the collective Anglo memory, the violence blurring behind sayings associated with the “Wild” West, such as “Shoot first, ask questions later.” For Mexican-Americans and Tejanos, however, these stories never died, preserved in mournful corridos (ballads) or family stories, outside mainstream culture. ([Location 6246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6246))
- Prior to the Mexican Revolution, few Mexicans came to the United States with the intention of settling. Men, and sometimes entire families, moved in pursuit of employment but with the intent of working for a few years on projects such as the railroads. Others found jobs with large landholders, who often had thousands of head of cattle. They needed able horsemen to move the herds, so they often employed Mexican vaqueros.* ([Location 6252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6252))
- in the twentieth century, water would dominate. Developments in hydrological technology meant that rain or even snow—in the form of melted ice flowing into the rivers—could be brought to the desert. A flurry of state and federal legislation allotted funding for infrastructure projects to facilitate what amounted to an environmental recasting of the West. ([Location 6256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6256))
- California was at the heart of this massive irrigation program, drawing the waters of the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Colorado Rivers to convert the arid ground. The lowlands area of the Salton Sink in the southwest of the state was, by 1901, rebranded with the evocative and grand title Imperial Valley.92 The tangle of pipes, canals, and aqueducts also gave cities like Los Angeles the capacity for growth. ([Location 6259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6259))
- This was not, however, limited to California—access to water was also crucial in New Mexico and Texas, and those states also launched irrigation schemes, for instance, using water from the Pecos River, which runs west of the Río Grande and south into Texas. ([Location 6263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6263))
- These projects changed the desert to meet growing human needs, part of a seemingly unstoppable march to a modern life where nature could be tamed at will. Endless brown scrub became verdant fields, allowing this part of the West to share in the Jeffersonian dream of a smallholder democracy. California’s Imperial Valley was likened to the Nile valley, with all the attendant biblical metaphors, as this land was made fertile. ([Location 6272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6272))
- Soon, however, the rise and power of large landowners cast a shadow over this vision. New problems were created as old ones were solved; for instance, in Arizona and New Mexico, people on Indian lands faced poor harvests and starvation because the river water was siphoned off for irrigation, and what remained could no longer deliver what communities needed for survival.99 In Texas, the ranches, and the social and economic ecosystems they supported, gave way as agriculture took over the Río Grande valley. ([Location 6276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6276))
- As rivers ebbed and flowed, and were dammed and released, so, too, went the movement of people. The rise of intensive agriculture demanded seasonal workers who were paid as little as possible, and a number of groups—from Native Americans to Chinese immigrants to Southern and Eastern Europeans to Filipinos and Japanese—filled that role with varying degrees of success. ([Location 6280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6280))
- The Chinese, too, faced prejudice. Sinophobia had long existed in the West, becoming widespread after large numbers of Chinese immigrants arrived in California in the wake of the gold rush. Many prospered and over time they were blamed for taking jobs or depressing wages, as well as for social ills, such as running illicit gambling and opium operations. ([Location 6286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6286))
- The growing racism directed at the Chinese culminated in the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the first significant law directed at immigrants in the United States. It banned the immigration of laborers from China for a decade, and the prohibition was later extended. However, Chinese people could and did continue to go to Mexico in this period, and many then simply crossed the border into the United States. There was little to stop them, at first. ([Location 6288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6288))
- By 1904, however, the number of Chinese crossing the Río Grande was deemed significant enough for immigration inspectors to be sent to border towns; they were known as the Mounted Guard of Chinese Inspectors. ([Location 6292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6292))
- Commerce was one engine that drove the busy pace of border crossings, and customs collection became important on both sides of the line, as each government realized it could profit from people being eager to go back and forth. ([Location 6295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6295))
- Campaigners against alcohol, narcotics, gambling, and prostitution had made great strides within the United States, culminating in the prohibition of alcohol in 1920, but this stopped at the border. For people who lived on the southern frontier, a drink was never far away. This fact rankled morality campaigners, but it was a boon for Mexican officials. Mexico decided to tax these vices and so raise revenue from the people from the United States who were now forced to head south for a tipple. Tijuana was perhaps the most famous vice district of this time, growing from an outpost of around four hundred people to a thriving gambling mecca, where casinos, boxing, and horse-racing, coupled with a steady stream of alcohol, provided popular—and profitable—entertainment for U.S. visitors.

- from 1880 until the 1920s, around twenty-four million people had come to the United States, many of them from Southern and Eastern Europe, provoking nativist pressure to limit the numbers of migrants. ([Location 6330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6330))
- The term “wetbacks” came into use to describe the people who crossed the river—a slur, like the earlier “greaser,” that would become racist shorthand for Mexicans living in the United States. ([Location 6351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6351))
- Some of this reflected the economic anxieties of the border region in the 1920s: in Texas, large landowners—regardless of their racial ideas—wanted cheap Mexican labor while smaller farmers and business owners, fearing for their livelihood, wanted Mexicans deported and the border strictly monitored.

- the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, which placed quotas on “undesirable” groups while making exceptions for Mexicans and people from “contiguous countries,” including Canada, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. For everyone else—though this did not include people from what was called the “Asiatic Barred Zone”—the annual quota was set at 2 percent of the number of people of that nationality already residing in the United States as reported in the 1890 census, with a minimum quota of one hundred people.

- While the Anglo officers were often from working-class backgrounds, the Mexican-American members tended to be from the middle and even upper classes of their community. Because of their status, they had what one historian termed “uncertain access” to a sort of official whiteness, which allowed them to take up roles in bodies like the Border Patrol, policing their own people. ([Location 6380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6380))
- In New Orleans, Mexicans were able to claim a degree of “whiteness” in a way that was not possible in the Southwest.124 With its access to the Gulf ports of Mexico and its long history of connection through trade, the city had offered an alternative for people looking to leave revolutionary Mexico. By the 1920s, Mexicans were the largest group of Latin Americans in New Orleans, though they would later be eclipsed by Cubans.125 Mexicans of all classes came to the Gulf region, and while the middle class settled in New Orleans, workers were lured to the cotton fields of the Mississippi delta, where they were paid more than they would have been in Texas or California.

- Mexicans in the Gulf and delta region were able, unlike African-Americans, to send their children to white schools and to marry whites with little interference from the law. ([Location 6392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6392))
- Dark-skinned Afro-Cubans were no longer permitted by the rules of Jim Crow Florida to access “white” mutual-aid societies, so they had to set up their own, which they did in Tampa in 1904: the Sociedad La Unión Martí-Maceo, which merged two other Afro-Cuban groups. Membership photos from the early 1900s show men of varying shades of skin tone, continuing to blur a color line that white Florida wanted to imagine was distinct. ([Location 6401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6401))
- Another WPA report described Ybor City as “a Latin community where a large number of the inhabitants have not become American citizens.” The anonymous writer observed: “The government … has done very little toward making the Cuban people … feel that they are Americans. Even many of the second and third generations of the Cubans, although born in the United States, and by right of the constitution, Americans, are not considered as Americans by many of the English-speaking Americans.” ([Location 6408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6408))
- The issue of whiteness dragged on through the 1920s, while the United States grappled with immigration. Who was deemed “white”—and therefore a U.S. citizen—was still unresolved. People from India and Japan were still considered not quite “Caucasian,” as described by the Supreme Court, yet they were not black. They were “nonwhite.” ([Location 6418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6418))
- On the back of this, renewed efforts by nativist groups, judges, and politicians challenged naturalization of Mexicans on the grounds that they were also in this nonwhite category, implying that Mexicans should be denied citizenship.

- Prejudicial ideas die a slow death, and as they die they can give life to other complex notions that are likewise untethered from historical realities. In the United States, the imagined “Spanish” culture that emerged in California around the 1880s began to move east. What evolved was a vision of a “de-Mexicanized” and pseudo-Spanish people that Anglos now wanted to “discover,” served up with a large dollop of nostalgia. This recasting of the past created an image of a people who were absorbed through conquest but whose “culture” rendered them “other.” By creating and promoting the Southwest on the basis of this mythical past, the Anglo world was able to control the image of Hispanics in the region, reducing their experience to a form of tourist spectacle. Yet real Mexicans were still in this landscape, relegated to the fields and other labors.142 Their everyday experiences, as well as those of Mexican-Americans, were being written out of history, the prejudices and discriminations replaced by an imagined heritage. ([Location 6455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6455))
- In California, the Spanish craze continued to spread, aided by the creation of an entire architectural style, known as Spanish Revival, which emerged around the 1920s.149 Newly built towns, such as San Clemente, which billed itself as the “Spanish Village by the Sea,” looked postcard perfect, with their white houses with red-tiled roofs. ([Location 6488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6488))
- Californio families were cast as living museum pieces in this fading past, though they were really split between a heritage that on one hand romanticized the story of their “Spanish” predecessors and on the other forced them to confront a world that increasingly called them Mexicans.152 However, they were able to carve out enough social space to claim this Spanish past and the implied whiteness for themselves, while the more recent immigrants were branded “lower-class” stock and “Mexican.” ([Location 6498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6498))
- The enthusiasm for all things Spanish could be found throughout the state. In San Diego, it was embodied in the restoration of the Casa de Estudillo in the Old Town part of the city, which tried to cash in on the Ramona myth, as this building was supposed to be the inspiration for the house where the popular novel’s heroine marries. The Old Town was restored and its hilltop presidio was rebuilt in 1929. ([Location 6509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6509))
- West. In the 1920s, a movement arose to bring a network of roads together into the Old Spanish Trail, mostly what became U.S. Highways 90 and 80 running from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Diego. At the time, no major road connected the southern parts of East and West. Today, that road intersects with what is considered to be the “real” old Spanish trail in Arizona and New Mexico—mule tracks used for herding cattle, smuggling, or gold prospecting. ([Location 6521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6521))
- While the Old Spanish Trail passed south of Albuquerque, Route 66, which linked Chicago to California, went right through it. By the 1930s, outsiders began to buy up the single-story adobe and wooden homes in the village and convert them to shops, selling arts and crafts.

- During the WPA period in the 1930s artwork on public buildings—influenced by the Mexican mural movement that started a decade earlier—included depictions of de Soto or was often based on the broader theme of “discovery.”163 Admiration of the conquistadores in this period reflected not only their use as symbols of conquest but also the comfortable dominance of the Anglo world over the Hispanic. The Spaniards’ association with Catholicism and even the atrocities they committed melted away, leaving instead men who seemed to be little more than figures from an adventure story.

- Spanish Borderlands was meant to be part of the Chronicles of America series published by Yale University Press, but when Bolton submitted his manuscript, his editor rejected it and three further drafts. At issue was Bolton’s interpretation; his editor wanted him to take a more Anglocentric stance and explain how Protestantism and the spread of Anglo culture triumphed over and drove out Catholic Spanish culture, but Bolton refused.166 His editor insisted on hiring a ghostwriter to help push the dominant Anglo narrative into the work. In the end, Bolton prevailed, and he even made a point of illustrating how Spanish culture had persisted, especially in the Southwest: ([Location 6575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6575))
- his 1932 address to the American Historical Association. He called this the “Epic of Greater America,” and it conceived of the development of the Western Hemisphere in a more holistic way, rather than focusing solely on the story of the United States. Bolton believed that the history of the United States could be better understood in a transnational context and that “the study of thirteen English colonies and the United States in isolation has obscured many of the larger factors in their development, and helped to raise up a nation of chauvinists.” ([Location 6586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6586))
- Franklin D. Roosevelt would take a similarly hemispheric approach in his attempt to foster, in theory, better relations with Latin America through his Good Neighbor Policy. This was an attempt to focus more on trade and less on military interventions in Latin America, a point he spelled out in his inaugural address of March 4, 1933, saying he wanted to dedicate the United States to “the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others.” ([Location 6591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6591))
- from 1880 until 1930 more people from Spain crossed the Atlantic than had done so between 1492 and 1880.3 In New York, this immigration cut across all classes, from Spanish workers seeking a well-paid factory job to educated elites seeking to practice law or medicine.

- Efforts at forging Hispanidad—the idea that there was a shared culture, heritage, and language between Spain and Latin America—had predated Spain’s loss of its empire, but the effort was renewed in the early twentieth century. Promoters of a “pan-Hispanic” identity thought it could counter the growing global influence of English-speaking U.S. culture.

- Rumba music has at its structural core the clave, a pattern of five beats usually played on claves, a pair of wooden sticks; at its historical core, rumba was part of Afro-Cuban culture, coming from slaves in sugar plantations and free people of color in the cities, as part of a tradition in which people gathered to sing and dance, and was also connected to Cuba’s vibrant culture of Catholic processions.

- Despite the musical successes, in general race continued to stalk musicians from the Hispanic Caribbean, with lighter-skinned Puerto Ricans and Cubans playing to all-white downtown crowds in New York, many times as the “relief” bands for bigger orchestras at clubs or upscale hotels, while Afro-Caribbean musicians were often limited to playing in Harlem and elsewhere uptown.

- Following on the heels of the rumba came the even more popular mambo, again a style drawing from Cuba’s African roots, with the term possibly being of Congolese origin. ([Location 6797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6797))
- As fevered as the mambo was, by the mid-1950s it gave way to the smoother cha-cha (or cha-cha-chá), another Cuban style that found its way north. It was slower than the mambo, and its dance steps were an “one-two-cha-cha-chá.” ([Location 6811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=6811))
- It is around this point that salsa, a sound that blended these influences, also began to gain ground. Salsa would take over Latin American music, becoming popular throughout the world and tying together many of the strains of Latin music in New York.

- On the afternoon of March 1, 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists brought guns into the U.S. House of Representatives and opened fire, shouting “¡Viva Puerto Rico libre!” No one was killed, but five representatives were wounded. According to one account, the shooters “shouted for the freedom of their homeland as they fired murderously although at random from a spectators’ gallery.” ([Location 7035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7035))
- Between 1920 and 1930, the Mexican and Mexican-American population in the United States doubled to around 1.4 million, as recorded in the 1930 census, with the vast majority living in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, and Colorado.

- In Texas, for instance, Emma Tenayuca led more than ten thousand pecan shellers in San Antonio out on a strike over low wages and poor conditions in 1938.32 The growing national hostility to communism made union activity difficult for many workers, including Mexicans; every strike had the potential to turn into a witch hunt.

- His real focus, however, was on land, the redistribution of which had slowed down since the revolution, and he wanted to build up the communal ejido farms. By 1940 he had redistributed some eighteen million hectares, taking the number of ejidos from 15 percent of cultivated land to 47 percent.

- The 1930s would be a brutal decade for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans within the United States. Worsening job prospects and growing hostility meant fewer Mexicans were crossing legally, and the recorded numbers fell from 61,622 in 1928 to 2,058 in 1932.37 Throughout the decade, the tide of migrants turned, repelled in part by discrimination and given an extra impetus in some places by rumors of imminent deportation. In Los Angeles, officials conducted raids in Mexican neighborhoods—including El Pueblo on February 26, 1931—further raising fears and sending a strong message to the Mexican community.38 It worked: in 1931, some 40,000 Mexicans left California, and that year more people were sent out of the United States than had entered.39 The Immigration Service continued to operate sweeps and roundups of Mexicans at places all over the country, including cities such as New York, Chicago, and Detroit. ([Location 7262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7262))
- The result was the repatriation, voluntary or by force, of at least four hundred thousand Mexicans in the 1930s, though some calculations suggest that more than one million returned. Underneath that figure is a more surprising statistic: up to 60 percent of these people were born in the United States and were thus full citizens. It was a traumatic time for many of these deportees, especially those who had never lived in Mexico before and felt themselves to be—and indeed often were—American. ([Location 7272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7272))
- The question of legal whiteness continued to plague Mexican-Americans, despite the efforts of organizations like LULAC to ensure that Mexicans were officially considered “white.”77 Nativist groups called on the government to make “Mexican” a category, which it did in the 1930 census, although this classification was removed a decade later. In the end, the 1940 Nationality Act extended citizenship to “descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere,” but the ruling did little to change wider public opinion about the “whiteness” or otherwise of Mexicans and other Hispanic people. ([Location 7385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7385))
- Many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest were also forced to confront Jaime (sometimes Juan) Crow. Texas was a place, as one commentator described it, where “Jim Crow wears a sombrero.”79 Through a number of informal means, the southern system of discrimination seeped into the Southwest. There might have been nothing on the law books, but certain conventions led to rampant discrimination. ([Location 7391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7391))
- The Mexican-American author and campaigner Alonso Perales kept a running list in the 1940s of places in Texas that denied service to Mexicans. One entry, about Midland, gives some indication of what Mexicans faced: Mexicans are segregated and obligated to use a balcony in the section reserved for Negroes at the Yucca, Ritz and Rex Theaters. Mexicans are denied service in restaurants. At the Ritz Café there is a sign which reads: “No Mexicans Admitted Here.” Five American soldiers of Mexican descent were denied service at said café due to their Mexican origin. The local police are very unjust with persons of Mexican extraction. … Mexicans are segregated at all the elementary schools. Persons of Mexican descent are not permitted to enter the Catholic Church during the hour of religious services for Anglo-Americans.

- Following the deportations of the 1930s, the California growers’ lobby and other farmers’ groups had to clamor for Mexican labor again by the start of the Second World War. There were sharp demands for food, and the war had reduced the number of men available to work. The response was the establishment in 1942 of the bracero program (from brazos, the Spanish word for arms).88 It was intended to grant seasonal visas and streamline the processing of migrant workers. By 1943, seventy-six thousand braceros toiled in fields throughout the United States, and by 1945 the number had risen to three hundred thousand. ([Location 7433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7433))
- The 1952 McCarran-Walter Act made it a crime to bring in or harbor an undocumented worker; in part this was intended to keep out suspected communists—this being the height of the “red scare”—or anyone else involved in subversive activity.90 The anti-immigration chorus grew louder at this time as well. Mexican workers continued to arrive, however. ([Location 7440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7440))
- The deportation operation claimed great success despite corresponding public criticism of its rough tactics. More than 1,000 people were arrested daily, and it was claimed that more than a million people were sent to Mexico by 1955. However, the bracero program was still in place. In the same period, the number of legal bracero contracts continued to rise, more than doubling from 201,280 in 1953 to 447,535 by 1959, with around 150,000 to 200,000 braceros working in California’s Central Valley alone. ([Location 7465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7465))
- Often workers without papers ended up being legalized through what was called “drying out the wetbacks.” This involved illegal farmworkers being taken to the border, given papers, and returned to work. Sometimes a worker needed only to set one foot across the border to make the “reentry” legal.100 In the end, the power of the growers’ lobby contributed to the longevity of the bracero program, which had been due to end in 1947 but lasted until 1964. ([Location 7469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7469))
- The following year, the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 introduced another overhaul of the immigration system, repealing the national-origins quotas and allowing 290,000 visas a year, with up to 20,000 per country in the Eastern Hemisphere (Europe, Asia, and Africa), for a maximum total of 170,000, while the entire Western Hemisphere was allotted 120,000 overall. ([Location 7473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7473))
- Overall, visas were to be prioritized for current citizens’ or residents’ family members, or for immigrants who had desirable professional skills.101 ([Location 7476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7476))
- in 1976, an amendment was introduced to establish country quotas of 20,000 for the nations of the Western Hemisphere; it hit Mexicans the hardest, as they were the largest group of immigrants.102 In that same year, 781,000 Mexicans were apprehended as “illegal” after the quota changes, in addition to the closing of a loophole that had previously allowed undocumented Mexicans to regularize their papers if they gave birth to children in the United States. The exceptions that had long existed for Mexico were now firmly at an end. ([Location 7478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7478))
- Poverty was not the only barrier to home ownership. Often Hispanics were barred from owning or even renting in certain parts of cities, or, in more extreme cases, they were excluded from an entire town. Peppered throughout the United States were what were known as “sundown” towns—shorthand for the sentiment “Don’t let the sun set on you here”—with the intention of keeping the population white. ([Location 7589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7589))
- Other types of housing discrimination were often more straightforward. The “declaration of restrictions” for a new housing estate in 1950s Phoenix stipulated, “None of the lots numbered One (1) to Thirteen (13) inclusive; Fifteen to Seventy (15 to 70) inclusive, shall ever be sold, leased, rented to or occupied by any person who is, or whose spouse is, or who is a descendant of or whose spouse is a descendant of a Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican-Indian, American-Indian, Korean, Malay, Filipino, Negro or Hindu, or any person of any race other than the White or Caucasian Race.”138 Such stipulations were far from uncommon. ([Location 7597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7597))
- The Sunbelt areas of the Southwest had experienced rapid population growth during and after the war. Tucson, for example, which had 35,000 people in 1940, became a city of 213,000 by 1960.139 In such places, attempts were made to keep Mexican-Americans from buying homes in certain exclusive neighborhoods. Middle-class Mexican-Americans found themselves at times being forced to distance themselves from working-class Hispanics because the term “Mexican” was becoming associated with a lower social class. ([Location 7603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7603))
- The Fair Housing Act of 1968 would attempt to end the practices that led to these divisions by prohibiting “discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of dwellings based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” By this point, however, many cities were already entrenched in segregation, and those invisible lines continue making silent divisions to the present day. Places like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Miami have all historically been home to Hispanic neighborhoods (barrios), and studies show that this general trend has continued, with at least nine million Hispanic people in 2000 living in metropolitan areas where they still experience a high degree of segregation. ([Location 7612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7612))
- Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Mexican and Mexican-American children often attended segregated facilities; some 90 percent of schools in Texas and 85 percent of those in California were separate. ([Location 7618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7618))
- today, some 50 percent of Hispanic children in California attend schools, often in poorer areas, where the student body is less than 10 percent white.153 “We are more segregated in school today than we were in 1947,” Mendez said. “What we have now is de facto segregation.” ([Location 7655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7655))

- To prevent Mexican-Americans from casting ballots, some places had long had Jim Crow–type barriers such as the poll tax in Texas, which was not ruled unconstitutional until 1966.161 Correspondingly, Hispanic representation across the Southwest was minimal, although John F. Kennedy’s election in 1960 mobilized Hispanic voters. Excited about the prospect of Kennedy’s presidency, Hector García became involved in the Viva Kennedy clubs set up by Mexican-Americans for the 1960 campaign to bolster national support among Hispanic voters. A membership card from the campaign features a blue-and-white illustration of JFK wearing a sombrero with “Viva” written on the front, while sitting on a Democratic donkey. ([Location 7690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7690))

- While García and many other activists in Mexican-American communities made great gains in the 1950s and early 1960s, by the end of the latter decade a new generation was on the rise, and moving in a very different direction. Perhaps the best-known figure of this period was César Chávez, who brought the appalling conditions of migrant farmworkers to national attention. ([Location 7707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7707))
- Chávez was a proponent of nonviolent means, though confrontation had long been the hallmark of suppression of agricultural unions in California and Texas.168 One of his best-known campaigns involved the Delano grape strike and boycott, a series of protests and strikes starting in 1965 and involving Hispanic and Filipino grape-pickers. As part of this, Chávez led farmworkers on a march for more than 250 miles from Delano to the California state capital, Sacramento, under a banner with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, imploring consumers to boycott any grapes that did not have a union sticker on them. By 1970, the boycott had paid off and grape-growers allowed union contracts for their workers. ([Location 7720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7720))
- The Chicano generation rejected the “Spanish myth” and instead looked to indigenous culture in the Southwest and Mexico, often criticizing Mexican-Americans who claimed whiteness at the expense of their Indian roots.180 The question of identity, however, would not be easily resolved, in part because of the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that coexisted under the umbrella of Latino and Mexican. ([Location 7757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7757))
- Venezuelans, and others from across the hemisphere. Although Tampa had been home to Cuba’s earlier generation of émigrés, Miami would far eclipse it. ([Location 7858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7858))
- Often they were light-skinned, but like the Cubans who emigrated before them to Ybor City in the late nineteenth century, they were entering the South of Jim Crow. In part because they were identified as Spanish-speakers, they ended up occupying a space in Miami somewhere between black and white. Unlike their Spanish-speaking counterparts in places like Texas, Cubans in Miami could, for the most part, swim, eat, and take public transportation in the same places as the white community. ([Location 7901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7901))
- However Anglo Miamians felt about the new arrivals, Cubans were actors in a much larger Cold War drama, one that was taking place uncomfortably close to the United States, and so they were afforded special privileges, not least the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. This allowed any Cuban who had been in the United States for a year to become a permanent resident. Then, they would be eligible for an expedited pathway to U.S. citizenship. In addition, between 1961 and 1971 the U.S. government spent $730 million on its Cuban Refugee Program, facilitating resettlement by providing services like transportation or help in finding employment. Other policies and plans were established on a local level to aid the new arrivals, including classes in English.

- The United States had been covertly involved in conflicts since the start of the Cold War; its operations included the toppling of the regime in Guatemala in 1954; the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973; training and funding the Contras to fight a civil war against the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which had overthrown the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979; and backing government forces in El Salvador’s civil war.

- In 1982, Mexico, owing billions, defaulted on loans given by foreign banks. The default led to an 85 percent devaluation of the peso relative to the dollar. This series of events triggered what has been called the década perdida, or lost decade.28 Mexicans began to look north again, and by the 1980s and early 1990s, the number of “alien apprehensions” rose significantly, reaching more than one million a year, a 50 percent increase over the volume in the 1970s.

- Overall, the Hispanic population more than tripled in the 1980s and 1990s, going from 4.2 million in 1980 to just over 14 million by 2000. Of those, the number of undocumented people entering was estimated at 2 million for 1980–89 and around 5 million from 1990 to 1999, though around 20 percent of those people were not from Mexico or Central America. ([Location 7984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=7984))
- Within the United States, calls for immigration reform grew louder, and the result was the Immigration Reform and Control Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. This legislation granted amnesty to anyone who was undocumented and who had been in the United States since 1982. Some three million people qualified to have their status legalized. In return, security on the border was increased and more responsibility was placed on employers, who had to prove their workers had the correct papers.

- Clinton throughout the 1990s, including the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which cut off almost all welfare benefits for people who were not U.S. citizens or who were undocumented.

- With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the enormous sugar subsidy that Cuba received from Russia dried up, and the years after the fall of the Berlin Wall were known in Cuba as the período especial (special period), when severe shortages of everything afflicted the island. People were desperate to leave, and they crossed the Florida Straits on whatever they could find, from dangerous balsas (rafts) to hijacked boats.

- As English-only laws continued to spread, individuals, activists, and immigration rights groups mounted legal challenges. The Alexander v. Sandoval case, involving a class-action suit over Alabama making English the official language, reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001; in a 5 to 4 decision, it upheld Alabama’s English-only law.46 English as an official language has now been adopted by thirty-two states.

- Throughout the changes of the 1980s and 1990s, another development was quietly taking place: the invention of the “Hispanic.” The diverse Spanish-speaking groups still had an uneasy solidarity, in part because of geography: the East held largely Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans, and the West had Mexicans and people from Central America. Their historical relationships to the United States had been both similar and varied. Puerto Ricans were living with the island’s commonwealth status; Cubans had a long history of U.S. interference; and Mexicans had to contend with the legacy of 1848. Some mutual suspicion also divided the groups. ([Location 8084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8084))

- chicano or Mexicans. The meeting was stopped, and a committee was set up to determine what racial and ethnic terms should be employed by the federal government.51 Heated debate followed within the committee over terms such as “Spanish-speaking” and “Hispanic.” At one point they settled on recommending “Latino” but, according to Flores-Hughes, some people felt it “was masculine in nature and would include peoples of Italy and other Europeans with Latin roots.”52 In the end, Flores-Hughes backed “Hispanic” because it was the term “that best identified those persons with Spanish surnames that claimed their origin was Spanish.” She brought others around to her way of thinking, and in 1975 Hispanic was implemented into federal language.

- In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget issued its Statistical Policy Directive No 15, which forced federal agencies to collect data based on four racial categories: black, white, American Indian/Alaskan, and Asian/Pacific Islander. It placed Hispanic/Latino as an “ethnic” category, rather than a racial one, meaning a person could be Hispanic and of any race.55 After this, in 1980 “Hispanic” appeared on the census, where it has remained. ([Location 8111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8111))
- Out of the 47.4 million people who identified themselves as Hispanic, around one-third (15.8 million) chose “some other race” and wrote in either Mexican, Mexican-American, Hispanic, Hispano/a, Latin American, or Latino/a, eschewing traditional census racial categories like black or white.57 That the census form decoupled a “Hispanic” identity from race seems to reinforce the idea that Hispanic people can be categorized as black, white, or Native American, while the responses of the people who wrote in their race indicate that there remains no consensus over the meaning of Hispanic.

- “Hispanicness” is also sold to the Anglo community, in particular with food. In much of the United States there is no “Hispanic” food, only Mexican. Its style is drawn from northern Mexico or the borderlands. Now “Tex-Mex” means Mexican, much as Sicilian cuisine came to represent “Italian” cooking, ([Location 8148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8148))
- The overall number of eligible Hispanic voters in 2016 was twenty-seven million, up from twenty-three million in 2012, and the total Hispanic share of the vote grew from 10 percent in 2012 to 11 percent in 2016. Clinton took about 66 percent of the Hispanic vote, and Trump 29 percent, while in the previous election Hispanics gave Barack Obama 71 percent of their vote and gave 27 percent to Mitt Romney. Both figures represented significant Republican declines since George W. Bush polled 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004 and 35 percent in 2000.

- The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was extended ten years later to protect what were referred to as “language minorities”—groups that had struggled to cast a vote despite having the legal right to, facing discrimination or threats that blocked them from the polls. The legislative alteration also helped open the way for more active Hispanic involvement at all levels of politics.

- “Language is a huge barrier,” she said. Many of the recent immigrants are from rural areas, not cities, and speak only indigenous languages. ([Location 8707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8707))
- Many of the Hispanic people in Dalton and the region are also undocumented immigrants, so Familia-Cabrera and her staff have to find ways to reach these “invisibles,” as she calls them.6 Here, Dalton faces challenges similar to those of much larger cities. The biggest challenge is integration: “They feel segregated and they feel ‘Why should I adapt, if I don’t belong here, I’m not accepted here? I’m going back to Mexico at some point because I’m never going to be American.’” The second generation is stuck between the two worlds, she feels, with young people being told, “You’re not Mexican enough” by their families and, “You’re too Mexican—you need to be more American” by the outside world.

- Dalton, Georgia—like so many American communities—connects in differing ways to the variety and diversity of experiences within Latin America: third-generation Mexican-Americans teaching in the schools; first-generation Guatemalans speaking neither Spanish nor English; a Cuban doctor who thrived in the United States after the revolution; and a Nuyorican who decided to try out southern living. In this quiet mountain town, and across the United States, the Hispanic past continues to live in the present.

- Such a view is misguided, not least because it appears to draw from only one part of the country. The United States’ values, institutions, and culture were not formed just in New England, or in a vacuum. To a considerable degree they were shaped by interaction with the Spanish, Mexican, and other Hispanic people in North America, as well as with wider Latin America.

- The United States learned what it meant to be a regional power and, soon afterward, a global one, first taking Native American lands, then 51 percent of Mexico in 1848, before going on to acquire Puerto Rico in 1898, all of which contributed to the might it had to engage in later military operations around the world.

- The addition of people who had lived in part of New Spain presented a number of serious problems, including how they could fit into the larger panorama of the United States. Some felt they had no option but to invoke the chimera of “whiteness”; others could not escape their brown skin, yet they were not “black”; still others were considered “Indian,” and not European, despite being a bit of both. The idea of race could be stretched only so far, and its shortcomings were evident in attempts to place Hispanic people in the black-white dichotomy that had evolved during and after the era of slavery in the United States. More than a century on, the consequences of such racialized thinking have become painfully clear. ([Location 8746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8746))
- To be “American” continues, in some quarters, to signify whiteness, Protestantism, and the English language. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, the writer Toni Morrison observed: “Unlike any nation in Europe, the United States holds whiteness as the unifying force. Here, for many people, the definition of ‘Americanness’ is color.” ([Location 8751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8751))
- the loyalties Huntington worried about are not inflexible. People can speak Spanish and be Catholic and still enjoy aspects of U.S. culture, not least apple pie and baseball. By the same token, Anglo Protestant Americans can enjoy eating tacos and listening to Cuban music and not disavow their background and religion. The cultural combinations that are possible in the modern United States are endless. The question the United States faces at the moment is how—or if—these two visions will be reconciled: will it be by assimilation, or variation, or, eschewing such binaries, some sort of combination?

- Laredo, Texas, the most Hispanic city in the United States. ([Location 8839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8839))
- In the summer of 2016, news came from Parris Island, South Carolina, of a significant discovery. Archaeologists using technology that can measure changes in magnetic fields were at last able to pinpoint the site of San Marcos, one of the seventeenth-century forts built by the Spanish at the Santa Elena site. The autumn before, in late 2015, researchers at the University of West Florida unearthed sixteenth-century ceramic shards, nails, and other remains from the short-lived Spanish settlement put on Pensacola Bay by Tristán de Luna in 1559.16 All around these sites, submerged in the peninsular waters of Florida, lie Spanish shipwrecks, awaiting discovery. The landscape contains what the eye sometimes cannot see. ([Location 8856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GY2F3LV&location=8856))
