- as the story goes, a movement of courageous Southern Black people, with the help of liberal Northern whites, pushed the nation to confront the Jim Crow South and succeeded in passing two landmark laws, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act. But just days after the signing of the VRA, Watts erupted. In this version, systemic racial injustice and a noble movement are located in the South. The Watts riot becomes the first introduction to the Northern racial landscape outside the South—and Black communities there are cast as angry, alienated, and unwilling to work through “proper channels.” The problems of Northern Blacks are treated as much more complicated—cultural as much as structural; Northern youth pictured as inherently rejecting nonviolence and organized struggle; and no civil rights movement depicted in these cities before the riots.

- By 1960, King was publicly making clear “the racial issue that we confront in America is not a sectional but a national problem.”4 Throughout the early 1960s, he took part in rallies, meetings, and marches from Boston to Los Angeles highlighting the problems of school and housing segregation, job discrimination, and police brutality in those cities. In April 1965, in a speech to the Massachusetts legislature, King pointedly explained that “segregation, whether it is de jure segregation of certain sections of the South or de facto segregation of the North, is a new form of slavery covered up with certain niceties.”5 And in the Saturday Review piece, King pointed out that most Northern white people who praised his efforts challenging segregation and racial injustice in the South resisted those efforts and his own work in their own backyards.

- Indeed, in the decade before 1965, Black Angelenos, like their counterparts in New York City, Boston, Detroit, Birmingham, and Montgomery, took to meeting rooms, mass gatherings, and the streets to protest the systemic racial inequality at the city’s core. They held regular demonstrations demanding desegregation and equity in Los Angeles’s public schools, protested widespread police brutality in the city, and fought racially exclusive housing developments and a segregationist 1964 state ballot initiative, Proposition 14, which sought to repeal the hard-won 1963 Rumford Fair Housing Act. King journeyed to the city a number of times to join with them. They were met with white intransigence around school inequality and segregation, an unwillingness… ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1430))

- the early 1950s, Tackett led the Los Angeles NAACP’s Education Committee, which began attacking school segregation, the lack of Black teachers, and the presence of racial stereotypes in the city’s school curriculum.8 The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Board of Education vehemently denied the charges, claiming that it maintained a color-blind policy that kept no records of the racial distribution of students or teachers. As in Boston, in Los Angeles the need to prove the existence of segregation would be a persistent challenge for civil rights groups such as the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who demanded on countless occasions that LAUSD administer a racial census to document the obviously segregated nature of its schools. The board resisted calls for a school census until it was forced by the state to conduct one in 1966, claiming Black parents would object to inscribing race on individual student records. Subsequent access to school records in a later desegregation lawsuit, according to white ACLU activist and UCLA professor John Caughey, showed that the board of education (BOE) had been “reliably informed about where Blacks were” and thus had purposely “misrepresented its own knowledge of school segregation in LAUSD.”9 Similar to what occurred in New York and Boston, in Los Angeles, there were white community activists who joined the struggle for racial equality in the city, who also consistently pointed out the state-sponsored nature of the city’s segregation and were consistently ignored and in some cases red-baited for their criticisms.

- School segregation worsened in Los Angeles, as it did in many Northern and Western cities, after the Brown decision. As Black migration to the city increased, the board kept readjusting zoning lines to keep Black students ensconced in increasingly overcrowded Black schools. Many were forced to have double-session days, a policy LAUSD pursued in Black schools to accommodate increasing numbers of students, while a great number of seats went empty in other parts of the city.

- Instead of desegregation, Los Angeles school officials proposed increased funding to “culturally disadvantaged” schools, including money for new programs aimed at addressing “juvenile delinquency” and reducing dropout rates, and blamed “the lack of hope and motivation among some of these families which leads them into negative attitudes toward education and the demands the school makes on their children.” ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1495))

- unarmed secretary of the local Nation of Islam (NOI), Ronald Stokes, and wounded six others outside Muslim Temple 27. None of the seven men were armed. The fracas began when officers stopped two men, claiming they were suspicious because they were loading clothes into their car and there had been burglaries nearby. Stokes was shot at close range with his hands up. Police arrested seventeen members of the NOI, including those wounded, and blamed them for the trouble.24 Yet despite an autopsy that established that Stokes was shot at close range and had been stomped, kicked, and bludgeoned while dead or dying, the public inquest into his death found that the police shooting was “justified” in “self-defense.”25 ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1517))

- When Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad called Malcolm X out of Los Angeles, local activists continued pressing forward, documenting a widespread pattern of police abuse in the city and calling for Chief Parker’s resignation. Parker had become chief in 1950 and gained a national reputation for professionalizing the Los Angeles Police Department. Locally, however, he was known for amplifying an us-versus-them police culture and for a pattern of police brutality and harassment of Black Angelenos. His attitude toward the city’s Black community was stark: “They came in and flooded a community that wasn’t prepared to meet them. . . . We didn’t ask these people to come here.”29 ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1533))

- 1964, the burgeoning Black freedom movement in Los Angeles had to shift its organizational energies in an effort to defeat a menacing ballot initiative. Proposition 14 sought to repeal the new Rumford Housing Act, which banned racial discrimination in the sale and rental of property—a law activists had fought for years to achieve. Supporters of Proposition 14 explicitly denied any racial animus but asserted their property rights and claimed the 1963 act, by mandating antidiscrimination, denied them equal protection under the law. The proposition’s confusing language would provide a template for citizen movements seeking to maintain segregation by asserting the right to private property and freedom from government intrusion: “Neither the state nor any subdivision or agency thereof shall . . . limit or abridge . . . the right of any person . . . to decline to sell, lease, or rent property to such . . . persons as he, in his absolute discretion, chooses.” ([Location 1544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1544))

- Supporters of Proposition 14 drew on “culture of poverty” images to justify patterns of racial inequality in the city. LA County Young Republicans president Robert Gaston claimed, “Negroes are not accepted [in white neighborhoods] because they haven’t made themselves acceptable.”34 Calling the 1963 Fair Housing Act “the Forced Housing Act,” supporters raised contrasting images of happy, suburban Anglo families and dysfunctional, deviant families of color. In November, California became the first to “take away gains Negroes had won,” as King put it, when 75 percent of white Californians “voted for ghettos.”35 The proposition passed by a two-to-one margin, even as Californians voted by similar margin to return Lyndon Johnson to the White House.36 The message from the majority of white voters was stark: civil rights were good, as long as they didn’t come home to California.

- Nine months later, on August 11, 1965, a California Highway Patrol officer pulled over twenty-one-year-old Marquette Frye for drunk driving. Frye had moved to Los Angeles at the age of thirteen and struggled with the city’s segregated schools: “When we came to Los Angeles, we got into an all-Negro school. . . . I made ‘A’s and ‘B’s back in Wyoming but here I began getting suspended for fighting.”38 Frye subsequently dropped out of high school.

- When another police officer began hitting Frye and his mother, who had arrived on the scene, onlookers started throwing stones and bottles at the officers, and the unrest escalated to the looting and burning of buildings. In response, the police cracked down on the Black community at large. The city curfew only covered Black LA—an area the media began calling “Watts,” although it covered the neighborhoods of Watts, Central, Avalon, Florence, Green Meadow, Exposition, and Willowbrook. That this swatch of 250,000 residents could be effectively cordoned off from the rest of the city is a testament to the degree of segregation in LA. At the end of seven days, thirty-four people had died and hundreds more were injured, many at the hands of the local police or the California National Guard.

- As King made clear a few months later in the Saturday Review, this frame of surprise conveniently erased the multitude of organizations that had long highlighted and challenged racial injustice in the city, and his own efforts to draw attention to inequality and police injustice in Los Angeles and across the North. (The year before, following the 1964 Harlem uprising, King had similarly called for a civilian-complaint review board to monitor the New York Police Department—and been roundly criticized by city leaders.)40 ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1581))

- While many city and state officials, along with the media, blamed Black culture and underclass alienation to explain what had produced the uprising, a mountain of evidence from the research, testimony, and investigation that followed the uprising, including that of the McCone Commission convened to investigate it, made the case that the “riots” were political rebellions against racism in the city and nation. The social profile of the “rioters” culled from the arrest data indicates that they had better than average educations, and that they were employed, socially conscious, and aware of international news. But researchers for both the McCone Commission and the Kerner Commission (convened after the uprisings in Detroit and Newark in 1967) were disciplined when they tried to put forth this more political thesis.45 ([Location 1605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1605))

- discrimination, and patterns of police harassment and brutality. On June 20, 1963, four years before the uprising, nearly two hundred thousand Black people marched through Detroit highlighting pervasive inequality in the city and the unwillingness of city leaders to recognize Black grievances and address segregated schools, housing, or job exclusion. March co-organizer Reverend C. L. Franklin explained to the Detroit News that the march would serve as a “warning to the city that what has transpired in the past is no longer acceptable to the Negro community.”46 Active in union and open housing movements in the city, Rosa Parks appeared at the front of Detroit’s Great March alongside Franklin, the Reverend Al Cleage Jr., and Martin Luther King Jr. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1613))

- By the 1960s, twice as many people would be crowded into the Twelfth Street corridor, as these neighborhoods shifted from about 95 percent white in 1940 to 95 percent Black in 1960.49 Like the Parkses, many Black people couldn’t afford their own places. Decent housing for Black people to rent or buy was in desperately short supply. During the 1960s, the city began using urban renewal to clear Black neighborhoods to make room for development, gobbling up many Black homes and neighborhoods in the process.… ([Location 1628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1628))

- After years of trying to draw attention to issues relating to jobs, schools, housing, and city planning, the 1963 march was organized as a way to disrupt the indifference of most white Detroiters to the inequalities and injustices that shaped Black life in the city. The numbers of marchers rivaled those at the March on Washington in DC two months later. Labor activist General Baker remembered the Great March’s massiveness: “We didn’t have to walk but were pushed up Jefferson.”52 The size signaled a growing impatience with the lack of change in the Motor City.

- On top of outright brutality, police officers regularly took money and other items of value from Black people they stopped. Any note of protest could lead to a beating, according to Detroit NAACP leader Arthur Johnson, and a trumped-up charge of drunkenness, disorderly conduct, or resisting arrest.63 Police expanded the practice of arresting Black people simply on “investigation”; about a third of their arrests were made for this reason.64 And they gave scores of tickets to increase revenue. “There’s a certain time of month . . . that you can’t hardly drive around the block.

- The 1967 uprising began following a massive police reaction when patrons refused to disperse after police tried to shut down an after-hours bar. People had gathered that night to celebrate the safe return of two men from Vietnam. Because many Detroit establishments refused to serve Black people, and many Black business owners had difficulty securing the paperwork and capital for an official establishment, after-hours bars, or “blind pigs” as they were called, represented a crucial space for Black community leisure. Police raids on these bars had been, according to a Department of Justice report, a “chief source of complaint” before the uprising—and that night would be the third time ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1696))

- In the early morning hours, police began arresting people at the blind pig at 9125 Twelfth Street (Detroit’s Twelfth Street corridor served as a hub of working-class Black leisure). The crowd grew larger and more angry as morning dawned and the day went on. The police grew more violent and forceful, as well. At the peak of the unrest, the uprising encompassed fourteen square miles. The governor requested federal help, and 2,700 army paratroopers descended on the city. Law enforcement was given wide latitude to “subdue” the uprising by any means necessary. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1701))

- few months later, in a talk before the American Psychological Association, King reframed the question of riots by highlighting the injustice and white illegality that produced the conditions in Northern cities: “When we ask Negroes to abide by the law, let us also demand that the white man abide by law in the ghettos. Day-in and day-out he violates welfare laws to deprive the poor of their meager allotments; he flagrantly violates building codes and regulations; his police make a mockery of law; and he violates laws on equal employment and education and the provisions for civic services.”82 ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1736))

- The last time Rosa Parks saw Martin Luther King was seven months later, in the elite Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe. Repeatedly interrupted, heckled, and called a traitor that night, King made a point of contextualizing the riot the year before: I’m absolutely convinced that a riot merely intensifies the fears of the white community while relieving the guilt. . . . But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots . . . without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. . . . [A] riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.85 ([Location 1760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1760))

- Key to popular understandings of the civil rights movement is a view of racism as personal hatefulness—“Southern backwardness,” as civil rights historian Charles Payne has termed it. Racism is pictured as the governor snarling at the University of Alabama entrance, the Mississippi voter registrar continually slamming the door on would-be Black voters, the white mother spitting at Black children—key embodiments of those who perpetrated racial injustice but not the only manifestations of it. Our image of racism is violent, aggressively personalized, and continually located in the “barbaric South,” historian Heather Ann Thompson argues.2 There has been a tendency to personify racism in the figure of a working-class white redneck who dislikes Black people and spouts hateful things, as opposed to the middle- or upper-class white person who might decry such hatefulness but still embraces racially unjust policies.3 ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1806))

- The focus on the redneck racism of the Jim Crow South and its epithets and violence blinds us to the venality of “polite” racism and the “firm” resistance to Black demands, as King aptly characterized it. Other “polite” embodiments of racism were endemic across the country in maintaining white supremacy—public officials and citizens who preferred framings like “separation” and “neighborhood schools”; who utilized sociological theories of crime and “cultural dysfunction” to justify inequalities in city schools, services, housing, and policing; and who denied jobs, limited access to government programs, and maintained segregation through bureaucratic means. Yet these perpetrators find little place in these fables. By making racism only about bombing, blocking, and spitting, the nation gets off easy.

- With its roots in the nineteenth century, this “barbaric South” framing of racism was a strategic and purposeful Cold War construct that has carried into our present-day understandings. With the United States seeking to appeal to the hearts and minds of the Third World during the Cold War (and with the Soviet Union highlighting America’s racism), the nation was invested in casting the race problem as a regional Southern anachronism at odds with the liberal American way. In a paradigm born before the Civil War, the Deep South was portrayed as distinct and separate. Then, in the 1950s and 1960s, when a movement courageously built by ordinary Black people with support from the courts and the federal government took on these premodern racists, it was increasingly broadcast around the world, as legal historian Mary Dudziak demonstrates.4 In other words, the Southern civil rights movement came to signify the power of American democracy, where ordinary citizens (with the help of… ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1819))

If racism is pictured as mean Southern ladies who decide they want a separate bathroom for the Black women who work for them (as in Hollywood’s The Help) or as fat Southern sheriffs who block tiny children from entering school buildings, then most Americans can rest easy. In The Help, the main white villain is mean to her own kids and insists on having a separate toilet built for her Black maid. While certainly such people existed, racism also lurked in white people who loved their children and would never expect their Black maid to use a separate bathroom, who liked individual Black people and even were inspired by the Southern civil rights movement but didn’t want change in their own backyard (whether in New York or Alabama).5 Maneuvering and fighting to… ([Location 1828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1828))

Historian Charles Payne, in his study of Mississippi, found that every woman he interviewed who was active in the movement lost her job.7 Demonizing dissent was another tactic. The red-baiting most longtime civil rights activists encountered, and the firings that sometimes accompanied it, were convenient weapons of the “civilized,” because they demonized the protester and sent a message to an entire community about the costs of dissent.

- European historian Tony Judt highlights “the dilemmas of incompatible memories” to consider how popular renderings of historical injustice often gloss over how evil is actually perpetrated: “It is hard for us to accept that the Holocaust occupies a more important role in our own lives than it did in the wartime experience of occupied lands. But if we wish to grasp the true significance of evil—what Hannah Arendt intended by calling it ‘banal’—then we must remember that what is truly awful about the destruction of the Jews is not that it mattered so much but that it mattered so little.”8 As Judt illuminates in his examination of World War II and the rise of Nazism, what was required was both many people’s obsession with the Jews and many other people’s indifference about the unjust conditions and suffering Jewish people were encountering. Similarly, the way racial injustice flourished in the United States required people obsessed with racial difference and the maintenance of white rights who were willing to construct whole systems to delineate, hierarchize, and police it. But it also required—and continues to require—many people to care so little, who would not get involved, and who saw little urgency in the fact of Black suffering.9 It required many to believe that they had gained what they had through hard work and that other people hadn’t fared as well because they lacked the right values and work ethic.

- “Polite racism” worked through multiple means: through language that disguised it, through government bureaucracy and the leveraging of channels of power that enabled it, and through sociological framings of cultural dysfunction that explained and justified inequity and the need for punitive approaches.

- The first tool of “polite” racism involved language. While many white Southerners in the 1950s and early 1960s defended “segregation now and forever” and “states’ rights” and called Black people horrible names, a different vocabulary of race emerged in the North in the postwar period, and increasingly over the 1960s in Southern metropolises. The lexicon they employed celebrated “color blindness” and expressed “surprise” at Black anger; it cast African American and Latino youth as “problem students” whose behavior (and that of their parents) hampered their educational success and whose communities were filled with “crime;” and it highlighted “property rights” and framed resistance to desegregation in the language of “neighborhood schools,” “taxpayer’s rights,” and “forced busing.” Many of these people decried “racism” and took offense at the notion that their actions and perspectives were at all racist, in part because they too saw racism as being steeped in personal hatred.

- In the early twentieth century, Miller found, white liberal Detroiters saw themselves as “color-blind,” believed their practices would ultimately lead to racial equality, but were willing to accept racial inequality and segregation, even when protests emerged from African Americans highlighting the inequality embedded in city institutions. This frame of color blindness became the Northern way to not see school and housing segregation, differential employment rates, or brutal policing. With public support of racial segregation viewed as the distasteful purview of Southern racists, “color-blind” discourses provided a socially acceptable rhetoric to harness many Northern whites’ contentment with the status quo (and opposition to housing, school, and job desegregation).

- Increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s, these discourses provided a supple way for liberals to distinguish themselves from “segregationist” politicians while promoting and maintaining segregationist policies. US racism was a double act; Southern open-call racism provided an alibi for Northern “polite” racism; liberal Northern hypocrisy created a rationale for Southern white defensiveness. Part of the appeal of these “color-blind” discourses, then, is the cloak of deniability they provided for Northerners (a hypocrisy that Southern leaders often called out).

- this way, New York City school officials praised the Brown decision but claimed they weren’t sure how it applied to them. They gave the matter to a committee to study, miring civil rights activists like Ella Baker and Kenneth Clark in work to demonstrate the problem existed but ultimately refusing to take action on the recommendations in terms of zoning and teacher placement. They said: “This isn’t the South; we don’t have that kind of racism here.” Similarly, in Boston and Los Angeles, civil rights activists spent years on studies to “prove” that the problem existed, even as the segregated nature of schools was evident to the naked eye. And even when they provided reams of documentation, school officials refused to rezone, claiming the problem was not their doing, while offering money for programs to address juvenile delinquency (preferring to cast Black and Latino students and their families as the problem that needed fixing).

But most whites in America, including many of goodwill, proceed from a premise that equality is a loose expression for improvement. White America is not even psychologically organized to close the gap—essentially, it seeks only to make it less painful and less obvious but in most respects retain it.

- The second tool of “polite racism” involved the workings of government bureaucracy and policy, and the use of political sway to maintain it. Historian Carol Anderson has termed this “white rage.” According to Anderson, “White rage is not about visible violence, but rather it works its way through the courts, the legislatures, and a range of government bureaucracies. . . . It’s not the Klan. White rage doesn’t have to wear sheets, burn crosses or take to the streets. Working the halls of power, it can achieve its ends far more effectively, far more destructively.”13 Many white Northerners wielded their power and voting pressure at home, even as they might have pressed for desegregation in the South, understanding that you didn’t need a governor at a schoolhouse door if you had BOE officials constantly adjusting school zoning lines to maintain segregated schools. You didn’t need a burning cross if the bank used maps made by the Federal Housing Authority to mark Black neighborhoods as “dangerous” for investment and deny Black people access to home loans. You didn’t need white vigilantes if the police were willing to protect and serve certain communities while containing and controlling others. School officials used attendance boundaries, feeder patterns, transportation policies, teacher-hiring practices, and other methods to ensure that the vast majority of students of color attended segregated, underresourced schools.

- This was an ongoing, dynamic process. Throughout the 1960s, as court documents later revealed, school officials in Boston and Los Angeles constantly adjusted school-district and zoning lines to preserve segregated schools and used busing to maintain these segregated schools. In Boston, activists encountered an additional barrier: the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. Civil rights activists brought a complaint to MCAD hoping for the force of the state commission in pushing forward their cause—and in 1960, MCAD literally declared Boston’s schools not segregated. In 1961, in order to seem compliant with Brown, Boston Public Schools passed an open enrollment policy—which was used initially mostly by white parents to avoid changing schools, while Black parents found it difficult to use. The appearance of adherence, rather than substantive change, was paramount. Four years later, Black Bostonians began Operation Exodus, a busing program that made it possible for Black families to take advantage of open seats in the district. They assumed they would shame the school system into taking over the program, once they… ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1951))

- They laid out how the Chicago Board of Education had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: 90 percent of Black students attended segregated schools in Chicago, and these schools were more overcrowded, had more uncredentialed teachers, and had fewer educational resources or honors classes than other schools in the city. The US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare briefly withheld $30 million from the city, but as historian Matthew Delmont powerfully documents, the full weight of the Chicago and Illinois political classes came down upon them.15 Ultimately, HEW retreated, and Chicago’s schools remained as segregated as they had been. Following HEW’s capitulation, New York congressman Adam Clayton Powell aptly observed, “When the United States Office of Education was pressured into restoring Federal funds to Chicago’s segregated public school system, it represented the first abject surrender to the principle that separate but equal is wrong in the South, but acceptable in the North—particularly if a city can muster enough Northern politicians and educators with a segregationist mentality to practice this shameful hypocrisy.”16 Boston rested easy seeing how Chicago had prevailed. Indeed, Northerners repeatedly used political power and pressure to evade desegregation and federal mandates, with white parents using discourses of “neighborhood schools” and “forced busing” to assert their political will to defend their segregated schools.

- In their manipulation of the Civil Rights Act, Northern liberals used the veiled language of “racial imbalance” and “neighborhood schools” and applied their political power to keep desegregation away from their schools. In time, Southerners came to follow suit. Suburban Southern whites, as historian Kevin Kruse argues, “abandon[ed] their traditional, populist, and often starkly racist demagoguery [by the late 1960s], and instead craft[ed] a new conservatism predicated on a language of rights, freedoms, and individualism.”17 Thus, in many ways, Northerners developed the tactics that are now associated with some of the reddest Southern states in the union.

- As Lee Atwater explained, “You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘Nigger, nigger, nigger.’ By 1968 you can’t say ‘nigger’—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.”19 These cloaked racial politics proved effective for Nixon, but it wasn’t a particularly Southern strategy that won him the White House. In 1968, George Wallace won the Deep South. Nixon secured the presidency by winning swaths of the Midwest, Northeast, West, and border states—including Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon, and California. What proved successful in this Northern-Midwestern-Western-Southern-border-state strategy was an appeal to voters who still wanted racial policy but wanted it cloaked in euphemistic frames of “law and order,” “forced busing,” and “cultural deprivation.”20 As Nixon explained to his domestic advisor H. R. Haldeman, “You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the Blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to.”21 What Nixon introduced to the national stage, and what Ronald Reagan later crystallized with the “Reagan Democrats,” were strategies that Northern politicians… ([Location 1990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=1990))

What we have been getting is an inferior type of student.”24 Three thousand miles away, Los Angeles Board of Education members expressed similar sentiments around the “negative attitudes towards education” that Black and Latino families supposedly held.

- The politics of respectability had a long history across the twentieth century as many Black elites focused on remediating the behaviors of the Black poor as a way to uplift the community. But this took on heightened power and danger as those discourses and strategies moved into public policy.26 With biological arguments discredited after World War II, culture became the way to talk about race, in part aided by the rise of academic social science.

- By the 1960s, urban social science was booming, and scholar after scholar went to the “ghetto” to investigate this “other America.”30 While many portrayed these cultural adaptations in the context of systemic discrimination, poverty, and disfranchisement, they still depicted a dysfunctional culture holding Black people back.31 They lamented the “tangle of pathologies,” “family structures,” and “cultural deprivation/dysfunction” that were said to explain persistent inequalities and promote particular policy solutions. Political expediencies led many public officials to focus on the cultural part and jettison the focus on structural factors such as unemployment and unequal public services.32 As the Moynihan Report put it so starkly, “At the heart of the deterioration of the fabric of Negro society is the deterioration of the Negro family.”33 This set of Black and white academic voices dovetailed with white political elites’ notions of the problem, and so their approaches were elevated. What followed was the idea that the Black community needed uplift, mentoring initiatives, programs to encourage cultural success, marriage, and jobs for men (the report’s main author, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, recommended the military).

As Northern liberals took pains to make clear, this policing was not like those racist Southern cops putting hoses on schoolchildren. It was modernized, targeted, and employed through rationalized systems because some people required more control; not all Black people, they made clear, just certain “dangerous” types who were menacing the good Black people.35 Cultural framings provided a way to understand the kind of “help” and “protection” Black people needed and to provide further systems of control for those who continued on… ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=2060))

The civil rights movement struggled with this over and over.

- movement itself has been constricted and diluted, framed narrowly around bus seats and lunch counters, rather than the equity, access, and justice these activists demanded. Tellingly, Parks and her comrades typically used the term “desegregation” rather than “integration” to signify that their struggle was not a matter of having a bus seat or a school desk next to a white person but of dismantling the apparatus of inequality. Parks was clear that there had long been integration, even in the South, but it was for the benefit of whites; for instance, Black women were allowed to ride in the white section of the bus if they were caring for white children. It wasn’t some sort of osmosis that sitting next to a white person would lead to success—which is often the way integration is now portrayed. It was about access, equality, resource reallocation, political transformation, jobs, justice, and tying the futures of all families together, so that material advantages, opportunities, and expectations given to some would be available to all.

- Narrowing the goal of civil rights activists to a seat diminishes the expansive vision of justice they fought for, making the movement smaller, more cloistered, and less relevant to where we are today. If the movement is reduced to a lunch counter seat, then the oppression it fought against can seem long ago and far away, and its happy ending celebrated: the bus is desegregated, the lunch counter opened, the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed. But those pieces of legislation were not the ends; they were momentous steps on a much longer road for social justice. Massive victories won through decades of pressing and struggling around voting rights and public desegregation were just a portion of the modern Black freedom movement’s goals. Moreover, equating their vision simply with the Brown decision or passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act misses the important questions of how these would—and would not—be substantively implemented, and how hard activists pressed for full and far-reaching implementation.

- But this broader vision of human rights and economic justice does not often make it into popular fables of the civil rights movement, which often distort its goods into a narrow notion of personal freedom, seats next to white people, and color blindness. As the late historian Vincent Harding explained, “Our struggle was not just against something, but was trying to bring something into being.”7 In the fable, honoring the civil rights movement often comes with a slight lurking shadow—the ghost of Black Power and the “times when some of us claiming to push for change lost our way,” as President Obama put it in his March on Washington anniversary speech.8 In this version, the movement went astray in the mid-1960s, abandoning its dream of Black and white together for anger and separatism. This “master narrative,” as Julian Bond has termed it, has tremendous power over how the period is depicted: “Once Americans understood that discrimination was wrong, they quickly moved to remove racial prejudice and discrimination from American life, as evidenced by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. . . .

- the civil rights victories were piling up, many African Americans, under the banner of Black Power, turned their backs on American society.”9 The turn to Black Power, as Bond observes, is thus framed as inexplicable and ungrateful—cast as the product of an alienated Black community unwilling to work through the proper channels and unappreciative of its white allies. As the previous chapters have shown, this narrative partly rests on forgetting the decades-long struggles in Northern cities that had been repeatedly dismissed, disparaged, and denied. But it also ignores the broad vision of justice the civil rights movement had across the South as well as the North in the period before 1965.

- In The Butler, there are no protests of segregation in DC, no sense of Black poverty or police brutality, no systemic Northern racism, no movement for jobs, no school desegregation or open housing, welfare rights, or DC statehood—though all were occurring in the city in the 1950s and 1960s.11 Black Power in the movie is equated solely with the Black Panthers, who are then reduced to Afros, black leather, and in-your-face attitude. Louis’s girlfriend transforms from a well-mannered, feminine Freedom Bus Rider into a surly, unshaven Black Panther, whom Louis ultimately (and, in the movie’s take, wisely) jettisons. By the film’s end, Louis rejects the Panthers’ “violence” for more “reasonable” electoral politics and “respectable” women. While Black Power is rendered as dangerous youthful naiveté, war is treated as patriotic. Charlie attends Howard University at a time when demonstrations for African American studies roiled that campus, and he enlists in the army at a time when a protest movement among Black soldiers was rising and Black anticolonialism was burgeoning—yet none of this is depicted. In excluding or belittling this broader history of activism, the movie forfeited the opportunity to portray a fuller, more accurate history of the 1960s and 1970s and rendered Black militancy as angry, ungrounded, and out of nowhere. In many ways, even though the film was praised for its boldness (“brilliantly truthful,” the New York Times said), The Butler’s view of history was largely derivative, confirming the fable and obscuring the scope of what Black activists fought for and imagined.

Understanding the way these goals were woven into the movement from its earliest days reveals civil rights activists’ expansive “freedom dreams,” as historian Robin Kelley has termed them, and the massive opposition activists encountered.14 And when we see that one form white resistance took was the constant distortion and dilution of those goals, the political interests behind narrowing that vision in our popular memory today come into sharp relief.

One of the Montgomery bus boycott’s initial demands was the hiring of Black bus drivers, yet in our public retelling, that demand has completely dropped out of sight.

- At a December 1967 press conference announcing the Poor People’s Campaign, King zeroed in on the federal government’s “primary responsibility for low minimum wages, for a degrading system of inadequate welfare, for subsidies to the rich and unemployment and underemployment of the poor.” The nation had developed ways to ignore and hide the impacts of poverty—and part of the campaign’s aim would be to force the country to “see the poor.”25 Poor people would come from across the nation to the Capitol to demand “$30 billion annual appropriation for a real war on poverty; congressional passage of full employment and guaranteed income legislation [a guaranteed annual wage]; and Construction of 500,000 low-cost housing units per year.”26 The PPC’s first gathering took place in Atlanta in March 1968, a month before King’s assassination, and brought together over fifty organizations representing poor African Americans, whites, Latinos, and Native Americans.27 “It didn’t cost the nation one penny to integrate lunch counters,” King observed during a February 1968 trip to Mississippi, “but now we are dealing with issues that cannot be solved without the nation spending billions of dollars and undergoing a radical redistribution of economic power.”28 ([Location 2712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=2712))

- Key to the vision of the PPC was the idea that people had the right to social assistance and that people were not the cause of their own poverty, an unjust and exploitative labor market and centuries of racial and gender injustice were.

- invested in elevating white workers and mothers, and the shape of the Social Security Act reflected that.36 Until the 1960s, Black and Latina workers were rendered ineligible for other wage and union protections as the New Deal created what historian Jill Quadagno calls a “racial welfare state” that denied people of color “the full perquisites of citizenship,” while ensuring their availability as a flexible, low-wage workforce for US employers.37 Excluded from their rights as workers, poor Black and Latina women were also cast as “bad mothers” and denied cash assistance for their children.

- Welfare rights campaigns, according to historian Premilla Nadasen, “sought to instill pride in welfare recipients by debunking the racial and sexual stereotypes of AFDC and affording recipients a degree of control and autonomy over their lives.”47 These grassroots organizing efforts, along with President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, opened access to welfare; by 1971, over 90 percent of eligible families were receiving AFDC, up from less than 33 percent in 1960. With the mechanization of Southern agriculture and deindustrialization in Northern cities throwing more Americans into extreme poverty, the need for assistance also grew. By 1974, 10.8 million people were receiving AFDC, up from 3.1 million in 1961. This expansion of access to AFDC and the introduction of food stamp benefits began combating hunger and malnutrition in America.48 ([Location 2806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=2806))

- But even amidst this expansion, women of color were seen as unworthy, and escalating attacks on welfare in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s became a veiled but effective method of attacking Black and Latina women and the civil rights struggle more broadly and dismantling parts of the social safety net. By the time Bill Clinton rode into office in 1992 on his promise to “end welfare as we know it,” the fact that welfare rights had been part of the civil rights movement had long since been repudiated and forgotten.

- Vietnam has “played havoc with our domestic destinies,” King explained at an address at the National Cathedral the week before he was assassinated, as he questioned the nation’s priorities, noting that killing a single Viet Cong soldier cost “about five hundred thousand dollars while we spend only fifty-three dollars a year for every person characterized as poverty-stricken in the so-called poverty program, which is not even a good skirmish against poverty.”50 Racism and economic exploitation intertwined in “cruel manipulation of the poor” sent to fight other poor people in the Vietnam War.

- King decried the vast sums of money being spent on the war that could be spent on social programs at home, and the ways Black soldiers were serving alongside white soldiers, while at home, schools and housing and many jobs were still segregated. Highlighting the “giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism,” he continued to speak out after making this speech, intertwining his critique of war abroad with the need for social spending at home, even though he lost many friends, supporters, and donors.

- In diluting it to a bus seat—to something palatable, narrow, and finished—the fable conveniently makes the movement less relevant for where we are today and misses its far-reaching challenge. Grappling with civil rights activists’ internationalist, anti-imperial vision and their critiques of the injustices embedded in the US economy and criminal justice system raises questions about the United States’ role in the world today and foregrounds the enduring need “to turn sharply from our present ways.” ([Location 2885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=2885))

- Most popular renderings of the movement miss how the very people we celebrate today were viewed as scary or crazy or unwelcome in their own day. And they sidestep the kinds of reckoning this history demands: how people who questioned the racial practices of the status quo and refused to live by them were treated as “radicals, sore heads, agitators, trouble makers, to name just a few terms given them,” as Rosa Parks put it.2 This meant the civil rights movement was built painstakingly and often at great cost to people’s mental health and community relationships. By portraying these activists as consummate Americans, contemporary memorials gloss over the role local, state, and federal officials, as well as their fellow citizens, played in demonizing them as threats to the nation. Looking closely at this history, then, shines a different light on criticisms of “reckless” and “dangerous” activists today—and how fears of national security and public safety have long been used to rationalize political repression and justify the monitoring of “extremists.” ([Location 3489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=3489))

- Rosa Parks wrote about the difficulty of dissent—how much she pinpointed the effort and ostracism of being a rebel and the ways the system was designed to prevent it. “Such a good job of brain washing was done on the Negro,” Parks observed, “that a militant Negro was almost a freak of nature to them, many times ridiculed by others of his own group.” ([Location 3504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=3504))

- And while most Americans did not make hate calls to activists’ homes, the majority of the American public did not support the civil rights movement while it was happening. In a May 1961 Gallup survey, only 22 percent of Americans approved of what the Freedom Riders were doing, and 57 percent of Americans said that the sit-ins at lunch counters, freedom buses, and other demonstrations by Negroes were hurting the Negro’s chances of being integrated in the South. Just before the March on Washington, Gallup found only 23 percent of Americans had favorable opinions of the proposed civil rights rally.

- Lest we see this as Southerners skewing the national sample, in 1964 (a year before the passage of the Voting Rights Act), a New York Times poll found a majority (57 percent) of New Yorkers said the civil rights movement had gone too far. “While denying any deep-seated prejudice,” the Times reported, “a large number of those questioned used the same terms to express their feelings. They spoke of Negroes’ receiving ‘everything on a silver platter’ and ‘reverse discrimination’ against whites.” Fifty-four percent of those surveyed felt the movement was going “too fast.”21 Nearly half said that picketing and demonstrations hurt the Negro cause, and 80 percent opposed school pairings to promote school desegregation in New York City public schools.

- Nationally, white people’s support of the civil rights movement continued to be low across the 1960s. In 1966, a year after Selma and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, only 36 percent of white people said King was helping the cause. Eighty-five percent of white people said that demonstrations by Negroes on civil rights hurt the advancement of civil rights, while 30 percent of Black people felt they hurt.22 Seventy-two percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of King.23 In a 1968 Gallup poll taken shortly after King’s assassination, 73 percent of whites said that Blacks in their community were treated the same as whites. While many people of all races admired King and Parks in the 1960s, the majority of Americans did not and found the civil rights movement both wrong and unnecessary.

- The last time King and Parks saw each other was at a speech King gave in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, a month before he was assassinated. King said it was the most disruption he had ever faced in an indoor meeting.24 He was called a traitor so many times that night he finally interjected, “We’re going to have a question and answer period, and . . . if you think I’m a traitor, then you’ll have an opportunity to ask me about my traitorness.”25 But in the national fable of the civil rights movement, this relentless opposition prevalent across the country is often left out.

- 1970 memo by Hoover noted, “Increased campus disorders involving black students pose a definite threat to the Nation’s stability and security.”47 Hoover then “required agents to investigate and, if possible, infiltrate every black student organization at two-year and four-year colleges and universities, and to do so without regard for whether there had been disturbances on campus.”48 Every Black student organization was a threat; in other words, it wasn’t about what these students were doing, but who they were.

- The histories of these movements reveal the contingent and political definitions of “national security” and of those viewed as “troublemakers” and “extremists,” who bore the brunt of such targeting. Those individuals considered threats to national security have long included people who criticize the government and members of minority groups who are viewed as suspicious or un-American for asserting their racial pride and rights, and feared as potentially aiding the enemy in their criticisms. Such targeting was done not just by “bad guys” like Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover but by “good guys” like Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, who saw a need to impose special measures to control these dangerous individuals.

- This history of demonizing racial dissent shows the interconnections between the practices of surveillance and repression, then and now. It provides a caution to the massive surveillance state created in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and contemporary justifications that, if you’re doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about. By illuminating the ways full-throated dissent from nonwhite communities has long been regarded as “extremist” and “dangerous,” this history demonstrates that claims of “new urgency” and “imperiled times” used today to justify surveillance and monitoring are similar to the rationales used fifty years ago against the civil rights movement. Fears of Communist subversion that provided justification for mass surveillance of Black communities are replicated in the fears of terrorism that justify counter-radicalization theories and the widespread monitoring of Muslim communities today.54 ([Location 3708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0725DB585&location=3708))

- The MIA set up forty stations across town, and three hundred people volunteered their cars. People would use the “V for victory” sign to identify themselves to riders and drivers. As the boycott went along, using money donated by churches, organizers were able to buy fifteen station wagons to supplement the volunteer cars. The MIA’s elaborately organized car pool required tremendous effort and resolve, and considerable fund-raising. Working-class organizers, such as Nixon, were amazed at the cross-class solidarity of the car pool—middle-class people were willing to take poor people in their cars and have their cars driven by others. Over time, the MIA hired fifteen dispatchers and twenty full-time drivers, all coordinated from a building, known as the Citizens Club, at the edge of Montgomery.
