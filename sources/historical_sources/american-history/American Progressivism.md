- classical liberals, who see the fundamental purpose of government as the protection of individual rights and thus view with suspicion any extension of governmental power into spheres beyond this limited purpose.

- What, then, is progressivism? The bulk of this essay will be spent laying out its basic characteristics, but in short we can think of it as an argument to progress, or to move beyond, the political principles of the American founding. It is an argument to enlarge vastly the scope of national government for the purpose of responding to a set of economic and social conditions which,progressives contend, could not have been envisioned at the founding and for which the founders' limited, constitutional government was inadequate. Whereas the founders had posited what they held to be a permanent understanding of just government,… ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=90))
- The Progressive Era was the first major period in American political development to feature, as a primary characteristic, the open and direct criticism of the Constitution.

- Progressives had in mind a variety of legislative programs aimed at regulating significant portions of the American economy and society and at redistributing private property in the name of social justice. The Constitution, if… ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=105))
- many of the more theoretical works written by progressives feature sharp attacks on social compact theory and on the notion that the fundamental purpose of government is to secure the individual natural rights of citizens. While most of the founders and nearly all ordinary Americans did not subscribe to the radical epistemology of the social compact theorists, they did believe, in Lockean fashion, that men as individuals possessed rights by nature-rights that any just government… ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=108))
- Taking Wilson's advice here would turn our attention away from the timelessness of the Declaration's conception of government, and would focus us instead on the litany of grievances made against George III; it would show, in other words, the Declaration as a merely practical document, to be understood as a specific, time-bound response to a set of specific historical circumstances. Once the circumstances change so too must our conception of government. It is with this in mind that Wilson urged that "we are not bound to adhere to the doctrines held by the signers of the Declaration of Independence," and that every Fourth of July, instead of a celebration of the timeless principles of the Declaration, should… ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=114))
- Goodnow praised political systems in Europe where, he explained, "the rights which [an individual] possesses are, it is believed, conferred upon him, not by his Creator, but rather by the society to which he belongs. What they are is to be determined by the legislative authority in view of the needs of that society. Social expediency, rather… ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=120))
- that doctrine was meant to transcend the particular circumstances of that day. It was this very facet of the founders' thinking that Abraham Lincoln recognized, and praised, in 1859 when he wrote of the Declaration and its primary author: "All honor to Jefferson-to the man who, in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people, had the coolness, forecast, and capacity to… ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=126))
- Dewey endorsed, instead, the doctrine of historical contingency. Natural-rights theory, Dewey argued, "blinded the eyes of liberals to the fact that their own special interpretations of liberty, individuality and intelligence were themselves historically conditioned, and were relevant only to their own time. They put forward their ideas as… ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=130))

- Roosevelt called in the New Nationalism for the state to take an active role in effecting economic equality by way of superintending the use of private property.

- the clearest concession from Roosevelt that achieving his progressive policy goals would require a radical expansion of governmental power into the private sphere. Indeed, the very concept of private property would have to reconceived, Roosevelt suggests, with the national government to determine if private property was of genuine benefit to the community at large.

- Lincoln. Part of our debt to him is because he forecast our present struggle and saw the way out. He said: -["]I hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating mankind.["]And again: -["]Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.["]If that remark was original with me, I should be even more strongly denounced as a communist agitator than I shall be anyhow. It is Lincoln's. ([Location 3030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=3030))

- ["]Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. ... Nor should this lead to a war upon the owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor; ... property is desirable; is a positive good in the world.["]And then comes a thoroughly Lincolnlike sentence: -["]Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him work diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.["] ([Location 3035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002CQTVNW&location=3035))
