### Highlights

- The time of reckoning has arrived. The question is whether we will respond to the crisis by reaffirming the fundamental values of our 240-year democratic experiment or by replacing it with something illiberal, authoritarian, and ethno-nationalistic. ([Location 111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=111))
- Trump’s great strength in 2016 was that he, alone among the seventeen Republicans who ran for president, did not parrot the laissez-faire individualist’s creed: that reducing taxes, regulations, and the size of government would solve Americans’ problems. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=113))
- advocating government activism on behalf of “good” citizens and state-sponsored retribution against internal enemies, for whom constitutional protections might not apply. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=121))
- Wichita oil magnate Fred Koch made his initial fortune in the early 1930s upgrading Soviet oil refineries for Joseph Stalin. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=719))
- Koch became one of the founders of the John Birch Society, the extreme anticommunist group that regarded water fluoridation programs as “a tool of Communist dominion” and suspected President Dwight Eisenhower of being a dedicated communist. Government handouts, Koch warned, turned people “into dependent creatures without them knowing it. The end result is a human race as portrayed by Orwell—a human face ground into the Earth by the large boot of benevolent Big Brother.” For Fred Koch, public-mindedness would lead inexorably to a Soviet-style dictatorship of the collective. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=726))
- While sons Frederick and Bill would stay clear of politics, Charles, the second eldest, absorbed his father’s views, establishing a John Birch Society bookstore in Wichita and giving speeches warning of the dangers of communism. Another son, David, would later say his father was “paranoid about communism,” but he still adopted his father’s strong views about the evils of government and primacy of the individual. Together David and Charles would spend decades and hundreds of millions of dollars in an attempt to create a libertarian American movement committed to cutting taxes and regulations and ending government entitlement programs, bailouts, deficit spending, and efforts to confront global warming. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=733))
- They showered resources on the libertarian Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation and founded the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which issued reports advocating the privatization of Social Security, cuts to social welfare programs and Medicaid, and inaction on climate change. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=737))
- When the Tea Party movement emerged in 2009, the Koch brothers helped fund and organize its largest rallies via their advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, events at which their father might have felt at home, with speakers denouncing the UN’s alleged plot to bring a one-world government and President Barack Obama’s supposed aim to institute “socialism.” By 2011 the Kochs had become possibly the most powerful force in bankrolling conservative politics. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=739))
- Reacting to a genuinely despotic form of collectivism, Ayn Rand, Fred Koch, and their acolytes built a powerful countervailing force arguing for an extreme form of individualism. But, fixated as they were on the dangers of an overarching state, they failed to see that the alternative system they were advocating had been tried before, and had also led to its own brand of tyranny. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=743))
- In what is now Greater Charleston, they replicated the slave society they had left behind, but on the subtropical shores of a continent with plenty of room for expansion. The Carolina colony’s founding constitution was written by Locke and envisioned a multitiered society of gentlemen and serfs, with the former granted “absolute authority over his slaves.” Under the charters of government, slaveholders were ensured to have the largest landholdings, as the document provided that they would receive 150 acres for each servant or slave they brought to the new colony. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=810))
- By the mid-1680s, three-quarters of the colony’s plantations were held by Barbadian families, with the highest concentrations in the most valuable areas around Charleston and Goose Creek. On the eve of the American Revolution, per capita wealth in the Charleston area, concentrated in the hands of the planter elite, was a staggering £2,338, more than quadruple that of the Chesapeake colonies and six times that of New York or Philadelphia. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=814))
- The society the Barbadians established spread across America’s subtropical lowlands, creating a distinct Deep Southern regional culture that persists to this day. The Deep South in the antebellum period was an extreme individualist’s dream. The purpose of the state was limited to the protection of private property through the provision of courts, circumscribed police functions, and military defense. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=823))
- Individuals at the top of the social pyramid were highly protective of their own liberties, uninterested in those of others, and hostile to the notion of human equality. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=826))
- Taxes were extremely low, and were designed to spare those most able to pay them. The slave lords who controlled the colonial South Carolina legislature taxed merchants and other townspeople on the actual value of their property and assets, but imposed a flat tax on rural land based on its acreage, not its worth, meaning that a poor farmer with a hundred acres of forest in the hilly frontier paid… ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=827))
- With scant taxes collected, there were very few public services. Taxpayer-financed public schools had been established across New England in the early seventeenth century; in the colonial Deep South they did not exist at all, and in some states were not established until the 1870s, largely because of the strong individualistic spirit of the… ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=833))
- As Clement Eaton, a mid-twentieth-century historian of the American South, explained, “It was regarded as the duty of the individual and not of the state to see that his children were educated.” Members of the planter oligarchy hired tutors for their children and sent them to private academies, preferably the elite ones back in… ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=836))
- As late as 1850 only 10 to 16 percent of white children in the seven states dominated by the Deep South were enrolled in public school, compared to 60 to 90 percent of children overall in the United States. As a consequence, white adult illiteracy in the Deep Southern states stood at 13 to 26 percent (and 53 to 63 percent for all adults); in Massachusetts—the least literate New England… ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=840))
- The Deep Southern elite considered an uneducated population to be a good thing, and actively blocked efforts to… ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=843))
- When settlers in the uplands of South Carolina, which had been settled by independent Scots-Irish farmers and herders, asked state legislators in 1855 to grant their communities the right to tax themselves to provide common schools for their children, the planters who controlled the… ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=844))
- Because state law enforcement, courts, and prisons were so underfunded, people took the law into their own hands, and security and police work were largely carried out by privately… ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=847))
- Across the Deep South, slaves were overwhelmingly tried in private settings by their masters, who were allowed to punish or even kill them (but had to pay penalties if they maimed or killed those belonging to someone else). ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=853))
- As Deep Southern governments were forbidden to interfere in the economy or society, economic and social relations were almost entirely unregulated. A glaring exception to this official lack of involvement was the aggressive criminalization of speaking, writing, or disseminating any ideas that questioned the ownership of property in the form of other humans. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=856))
- Under an 1830 Louisiana law it was illegal to say anything from the pulpit, bar, bench, or stage that might produce discontent among the enslaved. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=858))
- The “freedom to own slaves”—an assertion of the individual rights of the property holder—trumped the freedom of speech in the Deep South and even on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, where South Carolina congressmen successfully imposed a “gag rule” on antislavery speeches or petitions, which remained in place for six years. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=861))
- While a weak state will never become a collectivist dictatorship like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, it will also prove no match for another common source of tyranny: the rich and powerful, who in the effort to maximize their own freedom will quickly deprive most everyone else of the same, either by monopolizing the means of advancement or by explicitly redefining who is entitled to the benefits of being a free individual. The result, for the Deep South and so many other societies, past and present, is a despotism of the elite, where an oligarchy is free to do what they will to everyone else. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=882))
- As the Deep South’s planters accumulated wealth and power during the eighteenth-century rice boom and nineteenth-century cotton one, they continued to maximize their individual liberty by constraining everyone else’s. In most of the colonies in the region, there were stiff property requirements to be allowed to vote, and progressively more stringent ones to stand for various levels of office, under the theory that the people who owned the country should be the ones to govern it. South Carolina maintained this exclusionary system right up to the Civil War. Power was concentrated in the state legislature, but the ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=917))
- America is not a unitary society with a single set of broadly accepted cultural norms, like Japan, Sweden, or Hungary. It’s a contentious federation comprising eleven competing regional cultures, most of them centuries old, each with a different take on the balance between individual liberty and the common good. This makes understanding the debates in our country—past as well as present—unusually difficult, especially as few are aware of the true contours of our fractious regional cultures and the conditions in which the dominant ethos of each was forged. ([Location 961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=961))
- We’re accustomed to thinking of American regionalism along relatively straightforward Mason-Dixon lines: North against South, Yankee blue against Dixie gray or, these days, red. The reality is more complicated than that, and not just because this paradigm excludes the western half of the country. In the East alone there are massive, obvious, and long-standing cultural fissures within states like Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and Ohio. Nor are cultural fault lines reflected in the boundaries of more westerly states. Northern and downstate Illinois might as well be different planets. The coastal regions of Oregon and Washington have more in common with each other and with the coasts of British Columbia and Northern California than they do with the interiors of their own states. Austin may be the state capital, but Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are the hubs of the Three Texases, while citizens of the Two Missouris can’t even agree on how to pronounce their state’s name. The conventional, state-based regions that are the basis for much of our political and social discussion—North, South, Midwest, Southwest, West—are inadequate, unhelpful, and ahistorical. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=965))
- It demonstrated that our country has never been united, either in purpose, principles, or political behavior. ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=977))

- We’ve never been a nation-state in the European sense, but rather a federation of nations, more akin to the European Union than the Republic of France, and this confounds collective efforts to find common ground and campaigns to force one component nation’s values on the others. Once you become familiar with the real map (see pages 60–61), you’ll see its shadow everywhere: in linguists’ dialect maps, cultural anthropologists’ maps of the spread of material culture, cultural geographers’ maps of religious regions, and the famous blue county/red county maps of nearly every hotly contested presidential election of the past two centuries. Understanding America’s true component “nations” is essential to comprehending the Tea Party movement, just as it clarifies the events of the American Revolution or the Civil War.1 Our regional divides stem from the fact ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=978))
- the original clusters of North American colonies were settled by people from distinct regions of the British Isles—and from France, the Netherlands, and Spain—each with their own religious, political, and ethnographic characteristics. For generations, these discrete Euro-American cultures developed in remarkable isolation from one another, consolidating their own cherished principles and… ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=985))
- Some championed individualism, others utopian social reform. Some believed themselves guided by divine purpose; others espoused freedom of conscience and inquiry. Some embraced an Anglo-Protestant identity, others ethnic and religious pluralism. Some valued equality and democratic participation, others deference to a… ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=988))

- the nation I call Yankeedom has put great emphasis on perfecting earthly society through social engineering, individual self-denial for the common good, and the aggressive assimilation of outsiders. It has prized education, intellectual achievement, community (rather than individual) empowerment, and broad citizen participation in politics and government, the latter viewed as the… ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=998))
- From its New England core, it has spread with its settlers across upper New York State; the northern strips of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa; parts of the eastern Dakotas; northward into the upper Great Lakes… ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1001))
- Whereas in other regions, counties held considerable power and towns had little, if any, in New England and much of Yankeedom counties had few powers at all so as to confound the emergence of unaccountable political forces. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1015))
- Government, to the Yankee mind, was conceived not as the enemy but rather as an embodiment of its citizenry. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1018))
- Yankees would come to have a faith in government and public institutions to a degree that was unimaginable to the people of other regions. Government, New Englanders believed from the outset, could defend the public good from the selfish machinations of moneyed interests. It could enforce community standards through the prohibition or regulation of undesirable activities, from adultery and swearing in the sixteenth century to slavery and drinking in the nineteenth. It could create a better society through public spending on infrastructure and schools. Even the pursuit of profit—a subject with which the Yankee elite was obsessed—was conceived as being not a private endeavor but a civic responsibility, part of the continuing duty of building the New Zion ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1019))
- Here was a society that prized the common good, distrusted the selfish motivations of individuals, and aspired to lead America and the world to the light. ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1030))
- the regional culture I call New Netherland has displayed its salient characteristics throughout its history: a global commercial trading culture—multiethnic, multireligious, and materialistic—with a profound tolerance for diversity and an unflinching commitment to the freedom of inquiry and conscience. Today it comprises Greater New York City, including northern New Jersey, western Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1033))
- Not particularly democratic or concerned with great moral questions—it tolerated slavery and defended the Deep South until the 1861 attack on federal troops at Fort Sumter—it nonetheless has found itself in alliance with Yankeedom in defense of a shared commitment to public-sector institutions and a rejection of evangelical prescriptions for individual behavior. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1038))
- The early New Netherlanders, to a remarkable degree, struck a balance between individualistic aspirations and the common good. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1041))
- Unlike the English Puritans in New England, the New Netherlanders didn’t expect much self-government—there were no representative assemblies and, for much of the Dutch period, no municipal government—but they did expect what did exist to provide for the common good. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1048))
- More important, New Netherlanders constrained their government with strong and explicit protections of individual liberties, which they believed to be their birthright. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1058))
- In the aftermath of the American Revolution, residents of the New Netherland section of New York spearheaded the passage of a state law granting additional rights, including free elections, freedom of speech for legislators, and the guarantee that any new taxes could be imposed only by the people’s legislative representatives. Not surprisingly, it was New York that insisted on the inclusion of a Bill of Rights to the proposed U.S. Constitution. A multireligious society with a tradition of free presses and a historical experience of foreign occupation and authoritarian-minded corporate governors, New Netherlanders were—and remain—attuned to the importance of protecting civil liberties in maintaining a free society. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1063))
- The Midlands, America’s great swing region, was founded by English Quakers, who believed in humans’ inherent goodness and welcomed people of many nations and creeds to their utopian colonies on the shores of Delaware Bay. Pluralistic and organized around the middle class, the Midlands spawned the culture of Middle America and the heartland, where ethnic and ideological purity have never been a priority, government has been seen as an unwelcome intrusion, and political opinion has been moderate, even apathetic. ([Location 1082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1082))
- An ethnic mosaic from the start—it had a German rather than British majority at the time of the Revolution—it shares the Yankee belief that society should be organized to benefit ordinary people, but rejects top-down government intervention. From its cultural hearth in southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and northern Delaware and Maryland, Midland culture spread through central Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; northern Missouri; most of Iowa; southern Ontario; and the eastern halves of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, sharing the border cities of Chicago (with Yankeedom) and Greater St. Louis (with Greater Appalachia). ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1086))
- Like Yankeedom, the Midlands got its start as a utopian project, but one with an entirely different character. With their optimistic take on human nature, William Penn and the early Quaker founders saw little need to coerce individuals to act for the greater good. Indeed, the Quakers themselves were opposed to authority and hierarchy, refusing to address gentlemen and nobles with their honorific titles or to doff their hats to them. ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1090))
- Settlers from a particular religious sect or part of the world—Welsh or Mennonites, or German Palatines—were allowed to form their own communities to actively… ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1096))
- Order was expected to occur naturally as the result of each person observing the golden rule: to do unto others as you would have done to yourself. Government was relatively weak, and… ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1100))
- The underlying ethos of the Midlander colonies was egalitarian. Family farms—individual and independent—were the primary driver of their rapidly growing economy… ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1102))
- Here was a community-minded society distrustful of strong government, a nation where people assumed the best in people and therefore could do without one. If the Midlander ethos were to be stated in a single sentence, it would be, “Government, let… ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1107))
- Built by the younger sons of southern English gentry, Tidewater was meant to reproduce the semifeudal manorial society of the countryside they’d left behind, where economic, political, and social affairs were run by and for landed aristocrats. These self-identified “Cavaliers” largely succeeded in their aims, turning the lowlands of Virginia, Maryland, southern Delaware, and northeastern North Carolina into a… ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1111))

- The society that took hold in the Chesapeake country in the aftermath of the English Civil War is best described as hierarchically libertarian, a liberal autocracy not unlike that which was taking shape back in England as the divine right of kings was discredited. Landed gentlemen, many aspiring to nobility, had a near-monopoly control over property, power, religious institutions, and the law. They were the masters of their estates, the “heads” with the… ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1118))
- They enjoyed “liberties”—that is, privileges—that others did not, including the avoidance of taxes and corporal punishment, and the ability to stand for public office. These came, however, with the responsibility to guide society, to provide for one’s… ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1122))
- Theirs was an aristocratic collectivism, a seventeenth-century version of Downton Abbey, where the good of the community was foremost but the elite’s right to lead was supposed to go unquestioned. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1149))
- Founded in the early eighteenth century by wave upon wave of rough, bellicose settlers from the war-ravaged borderlands of Northern Ireland, northern England, and the Scottish lowlands, Greater Appalachia has often been lampooned as the home of rednecks and hillbillies. In reality, it is a transplanted culture formed in a state of near-constant warfare and upheaval, characterized by a warrior ethic and a deep commitment to personal sovereignty and individual liberty. ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1152))
- From south-central Pennsylvania, it spread down the Appalachian Mountains and out into the southern tiers of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, the eastern two-thirds of Oklahoma, and on down to the Hill Country of Texas, clashing with Indians, Yankees, and Mexicans along the way. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1156))
- Intensely suspicious of lowland aristocrats and Yankee social engineers alike, Greater Appalachia has shifted alliances based on whoever appeared to be the greatest threat to its freedom; since Reconstruction and, especially, the upheavals of the 1960s, it has been in alliance with the Deep South in an effort to undo the federal government’s ability to overrule local preferences. ([Location 1158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1158))
- The Scots-Irish and other borderland settlers embraced an extreme libertarian definition of freedom: the right to rule oneself with as little intrusion by law enforcement, courts, and other political institutions as possible. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1166))
- As a backcountry proverb brought from north Britain put it, “Every man should be a sheriff on his own hearth”; the corollary to this, as historian David Hackett Fischer has pointed out, was that government institutions, including the actual sheriffs, had relatively little to do. ([Location 1169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1169))
- Vigilantes and lynch mobs—the latter named for one Charles Lynch, who dispensed frontier justice upon loyalists in Virginia’s Appalachian region in 1789—were socially accepted right into the middle of the twentieth century. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1171))
- Leaders—the local elite—relied on their reputations rather than social rank to attract a personal following, usually by having displayed bravery and decisiveness. The inhabitants of this region neither sought nor received much from their governments, and wished to keep it that way. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1173))
- In North Carolina during the 1760s, Tidewater counties received ten times the per capita legislative representation as the state’s large and rapidly growing Appalachian sections; the backcountry settlers reacted by forming bands of “Regulators” who seized control of their region for three years, beating lawyers, sacking courthouses, and expelling tax collectors, until they were put down in a pitched battle with Tidewater militia. Similar resistance movements formed across the Appalachian frontier, and during the Revolution past grievances fueled a horrific civil war in both Carolinas and Georgia, with ample atrocities. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1181))
- The region’s religious heritage buttressed its individualism. When the “Second Great Awakening” spread across the American frontiers in the years after the American Revolution, millions of Americans embraced novel religious forms, inventing new Protestant sects and weakening the established churches—Anglican, Puritan Congregational, Presbyterian, or Quaker—that had been brought from Europe. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1187))
- But while Yankee frontiersmen created collectivist religions aiming to fashion more perfect earthly societies—Millerism, Mormonism, Seventh-day Adventism—Greater Appalachia’s people embraced individualistic creeds whereby each person might meet God personally, be spoken to by him or his son, and be guided without… ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1190))

- Established by slave lords from Barbados as a West Indies–style slave society, the Deep South has been a bastion of white supremacy, aristocratic privilege, and a version of classical republicanism modeled on the slave states of the ancient world, where democracy was the privilege of the few and enslavement the natural lot of the many.

- Described in detail in the previous chapter, the Deep South is a hierarchical libertarian nation. It differs from the Tidewater in that its oligarchy has never had a sense of obligation or responsibility to the rest of society, but rather believes… ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1202))

- While it shares Appalachia’s emphasis on individualism, it is decidedly not egalitarian. If Appalachian people see the world as a battleground in which only the fittest will survive, the Deep Southern oligarchy believes those battles were fought centuries ago, and that their… ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1204))
- Today this resurgent culture spreads from the current frontier for a hundred miles or more in both directions, taking in South and West Texas, Southern California and the Imperial Valley, southern Arizona, most of New Mexico,… ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1210))
- Most Americans are aware that the region is a place apart, where Hispanic language, culture, and societal norms dominate; few realize that among Mexicans, norteños have a reputation for being more independent, self-sufficient, adaptable,… ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1212))
- Long a hotbed of democratic reform and revolutionary sentiment, various parts of the region have tried to secede from Mexico to form independent buffer states between the two federations. Today it has come to resemble Germany during the Cold War: two peoples… ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1214))
- Most of El Norte, the far-flung frontier of the empire’s already far-flung Mexican viceroyalty, was settled as if it were a lunar base: by militarized missions of farmers, ranchers, servants, and soldiers sent to establish remote installations. Most of the region was ruled by… ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1219))
- Since the 1960s, El Norte’s Spanish-speaking majority has reasserted itself, helping topple the region’s caste system and reclaiming its political rights. Its inherited legacy, as Chicano scholar Juan Gómez-Quiñones once put it, is of being “leery of government” while also maintaining “the fairly continuous expectation that government should provide for the general welfare, combined with the practical awareness that it provides for a select number.” ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1240))
- government is seen as an agent of the common good, even if there is little expectation that it will be able to perform its role without prejudice in favor of the region’s elites. ([Location 1244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1244))
- El Norte is theoretically a swing region, so long as its nonwhite, Spanish-speaking culture is accepted by the competing political actors. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1245))
- The first of these areas to be settled was the Left Coast, a Chile-shaped nation wedged between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade and Coast mountain ranges and stretching from Monterey to Juneau. This region was originally colonized by two distinct groups: merchants, missionaries, and woodsmen from New England (who arrived by sea and dominated the towns) and farmers, prospectors, and fur traders from Greater Appalachia (who generally arrived by wagon and controlled the countryside). ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1251))
- Yankees expended considerable effort to make it “a New England on the Pacific” but were only partially successful: The Left Coast remains a hybrid of Yankee idealism, faith in good government, and social reform and the Appalachian commitment to individual self-expression and exploration. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1255))
- The staunchest ally of Yankeedom, it battles constantly against Far Western sections in the interior of its home states. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1257))
- The Left Coast culture defines the common good differently from Yankeedom, as the project of creating a nurturing support system for individual actualization, rather than one to create an ordered community that will keep individual avarice in check. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1259))
- It is, however, very much a communitarian culture, especially in regard to that ultimate common good, the environment. Prior to the first Earth Day in 1970, the entire American environmental movement was based in the more collectivist nations—Yankeedom, New Netherland, the Midlands, and, most of all, the Left Coast. The Sierra Club, the nation’s first grassroots group, ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1260))
- settlement was largely directed and controlled by large corporations headquartered in distant New York, Boston, Chicago, or San Francisco, or by the federal government itself, which controlled much of the land. Because the region was exploited as an internal colony for the benefit of the seaboard nations, its political leaders have focused public resentment on the federal government (on whose infrastructure spending they depend) while avoiding challenges to the region’s corporate masters, who retain near Gilded Age influence. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1272))
- The Far West encompasses nearly all of the North American interior west of the 100th meridian, from the northern boundary of El Norte to the southern frontier of First Nation, including much of California, Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, Alaska, Colorado, and Canada’s Prairie provinces and all of Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Nevada. ([Location 1275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1275))
- The Far West’s much-celebrated libertarian streak—embodied in the image of the cowboy individualist, alone against nature and the corruption of distant urban interests—is tempered by the region’s dependence on enormous public works projects and government-supported industries. Massive irrigation, dam, and water transfer projects enabled cities and water-intensive farms to exist in an arid region. Federally subsidized railroads and, later, highways and airports linked it to distant markets. World War II and Cold War military spending—from the nuclear weapons labs of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Hanford, Washington, to the nuclear missile silos of western Nebraska, and dozens of military bases in between—became vital to its economy. ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1278))
- Having thus been exploited, Far Westerners have been highly attuned to issues of economic fairness. As a result this individualistic frontier culture was also a hotbed of economic populism, labor unionism, and other “common good” concerns right up until World War II. ([Location 1288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1288))
- Today the region’s people are mobilized against another perceived tormenter, the federal government, led by politicians who promise to get the government out of the way of prosperity and self-reliance by reducing regulations and oversight. ([Location 1291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1291))
- Egalitarian and individualistic—but not strenuously so—it is in many ways the analog of the Midlands, only with libertarian rather than communitarian leanings. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1294))
- The tensions that have arisen as a result of these clashing notions of freedom—from the radically egalitarian individualism of Greater Appalachia to the fundamentally communitarian outlook of Yankeedom or the hierarchical libertarianism of the Deep South—have brought our nation’s people to war with one another, and not just in the U.S. Civil War.

- When the English king and Parliament went to war over the future of republicanism in the 1640s, the Tidewater gentry and Yankee Puritans took opposing sides. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1317))
- When the American Revolution broke out, Midlanders and the Deep Southern oligarchs wanted nothing to do with it, while New Netherlanders rallied behind the empire for fear their individual rights would be trampled on by the unbridled Yankee communitarians who would likely control New York’s government if royal authority was overthrown. ([Location 1318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1318))
- Yankees themselves would seek to leave the Union during the War of 1812, which came to symbolize their loss of control over federal affairs to the libertarian-minded Tidewater elite. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01071RD56&location=1320))
