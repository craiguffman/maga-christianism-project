### Highlights

- I argue that mission history can be explained as a series of boundarycrossings, driven by a universalist logic. Thus the meaning of Christian mission is integral to Christianity as a world religion that exists across time, space, and cultures.

- Today roughly one-third of the people on earth are Christians. Not only is Christianity the largest religion in the world but it embraces a huge variety of forms, ranging from Catholics in Brazil, to Apostles in Zimbabwe, to Copts in Egypt, to Pentecostals in Ghana, to Lutherans in Germany, to House Church believers in China. The geographic range, cultural diversity, and organizational variety of Christianity surpass those of the other great world religions.

- The word "mission" comes from the biblical Greek words for "sending." Christianity, like Islam, is a "sending" religion. Within its philosophical structure is the idea of universality - that the message it… ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=66))

- While on one level Jesus Christ Superstar is a money-making musical, on another level its transcendence of Cold War geopolitical divisions - and the appeal of its rock-and-roll Jesus to youth everywhere - exemplifies the remarkable cultural fluidity of the Christian religion across the centuries. Whether told through music, art, sermons, or books of theology, the story of Jesus is repeatedly translated anew. Because of its embodiment in human cultures - an idea that theologians refer to as "incarnation" - the Christian message has outlasted clans and tribes, nations and empires, monarchies, democracies, and military dictatorships.… ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=103))
- By the third century AD, Christians could be found from Britannia in the north to North Africa in the south, from Spain in the west to the borders of Persia in the east. The eastward spread of Christianity was so extensive that the fourth-century Persian empire contained as high a percentage of Christians as the Roman, with a geographic spread from modern-day Iran to India. By the… ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=108))
- To become a world religion, Christianity first had to succeed on the local level. Specific groups of people had to understand and shape its meaning for themselves. What in totality is called a "world" religion is, on closer observation, a mosaic of local beliefs and practices in creative tension with a universal framework shaped by belief in the God of the Bible, as handed down through Jesus and his followers. As a world… ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=116))
- As a historical process, Christian mission involves the crossing of cultural and linguistic boundaries by those who consider themselves followers of Jesus Christ, with the intention of sharing their faith. The ongoing boundary crossings raise the question of how the meaning of "Christian" continues to include culturallydisparate groups of people: how does Christian identity change as it crosses cultures? The reverse question… ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=125))
- That so many non-Jewish believers were responding to the work of Paul and the other evangelists created a crisis for the original believers in Jerusalem, who sensed themselves losing control over the boundaries of the faith. This same dilemma has been repeated every time the gospel message makes itself at home among a new group of people. The cross-cultural spread of the message, including translating it into terms that made sense to a Gentile audience, set a pattern that not only separated Christianity from its Jewish background, but created a religion able to transcend cultural differences. The crucial decision to allow Greeks to become Christians and remain within their own cultural framework was the key that opened the future of Christianity to its global potential as a "world" religion, rather than remaining as a sect within Judaism.

- But the issue of authority, and how to define Christian tradition, even as Christian worldviews accommodate new cultural and generational understandings, is a perpetual balancing act in the Christian movement.

- Because of their loyalty to the one God, Christians refused to make sacrifices to the gods and emperor of the Roman empire. Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna, the last church leader believed to have known Jesus' disciplespersonally, was burned alive in AD 156 at age 86 because he refused to burn incense to Caesar.

- In the fourth century, the scattered seeds of Christianity burst into bloom everywhere at once. Christianity became too widespread for political rulers to ignore. With persecution-tested bishops, a network of believers across cultural and political boundaries, schools for theological training, and sacred texts in the major literary languages, it seemed that Christianity's time had come .5 ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=223))
- According to Christian tradition, Constantine had a vision from God that he should place the chi-rho, a symbol representing the first two Greek letters of the word "Christ," on the shields of his men, and God would grant them the key victory over his rival for the throne.

- Various emperors' determination that theologies were either "official" or "heretical" had profound implications for mission, as theologians judged to be heretics by major church councils fled beyond the areas of Roman control and spread their versions of Christianity there. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002LSJ06E&location=243))
- As different linguistic groupings interacted with the Christian message in their own languages, they solidified into ethnicities or nations with a shared history and tradition. The range of potential theologies increased in tandem with ethnic and linguistic differences. Thus the emerging fourth-century variations of Christianity should be seen as plural "Christianities," with each form developing according to its own cultural and political dynamics.
