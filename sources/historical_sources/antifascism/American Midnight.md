### Highlights

- It is a story of how a war supposedly fought to make the world safe for democracy became the excuse for a war against democracy at home. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=65))
- “The struggle of man against power,” wrote Milan Kundera, “is the struggle of memory against forgetting.” ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=71))
- For instance, twenty-first-century Americans are all too familiar with rage against immigrants and talk of fortifying the southern border, but this is nothing new: major candidates for both the Republican and Democratic Party presidential nominations in 1920 campaigned on promises of mass deportations. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=73))
- The military crafted a secret 57-page contingency plan to put the entire country under martial law. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=77))
- months. Right-wing TV networks did not exist in 1917, but in that year was born a presidential tool even more powerful, a lavishly financed government propaganda agency that operated in every medium of the day: films, books, posters, newspaper articles, and a corps of 75,000 speakers who gave more than seven million talks everywhere from movie houses to revival tents. In addition, the federal government also attacked the press, both during and well after the First World War. It banned hundreds of issues of American newspapers and magazines from the mail (a fatal blow in an age before electronic media), permanently barring some 75 periodicals entirely. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=81))
- With more than a quarter-million members, that earlier organization became an official auxiliary of the Department of Justice. Men in its ranks would sport badges and military-style titles, cracking heads, roughing up protestors, and carrying out mass arrests. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=87))
- The vigilantes stripped the Wobblies to the waist and made them remove their shoes. Then, one by one, they marched each man at gunpoint to the tree, tied him to it, and whipped him until his back bled. The lashing, according to one eyewitness, was done with double pieces of heavy rope soaked in saltwater; according to another, with a “blacksnake”—a long leather whip weighted with shot. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=102))
- Then the vigilantes produced a pot of hot tar. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=105))
- One member poured gasoline over a pile of shoes and clothing taken from the Wobblies, which contained their watches, pocketknives, money, and “everything that we owned in the world” in the words of one victim, and set it on fire. Finally, the Knights of Liberty told the barefoot Wobblies to run for it. To the accompaniment of volley after volley of rifle and pistol shots fired over their heads, they scattered into the frigid darkness. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=108))
- Wilson had been the university’s president until elected governor of New Jersey in 1910 and continued to live in Princeton until voters sent him to the White House two years later. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=119))
- Other forces also fed the violence, and most of them are still with us: a long-simmering nativism and hatred of immigrants; a military that had picked up brutal habits waging war on guerrillas in Asia; the bitter conflict between big business and organized labor that had raged for decades; and, finally, a nostalgia among white southerners—and many northerners—for the days when Blacks “knew their place.” ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=189))
- Yet he presided over the greatest assault on American civil liberties in the last century and a half. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=219))
- the Socialist Party, whose members had long dreamed of a workers’ commonwealth that transcended national borders. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=277))
- German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann had sent to his country’s ambassador in Mexico. It asked him to urge that nation into the war on the German side, in return for which Germany would reward it with its “lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.” ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=300))
- “We created this Nation not to serve ourselves, but to serve mankind.” ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=308))
    - **Tags:** #pink
- The rector of the Church of the Epiphany declared that war with Germany would be “a holy war.” ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=352))
- The United States was still several years away from ratifying the constitutional amendment that would allow all women to vote, but women could do so in many states, including Montana, where voters had just elected the pacifist social worker Jeannette Rankin to the House of Representatives. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=404))
- He was, in fact, the last president of the Progressive Era, the two decades or so when many American leaders in both major parties promised solutions—some meaningful, some not—to the vast chasm between rich and poor created by the country’s rapid industrialization. Progressives wanted to remake a nation where some lived in grand mansions but far too many in tenements where half a dozen people might share a single room. In the few years ahead, several notable progressives now in the Wilson administration would resign in despair; one would use his position brilliantly to defy the jingoism around him; and Brandeis would find himself in key dissents from the conservative majority of his Supreme Court colleagues. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=425))
- No one who had come to hear Wilson could forget that he was the first president to earn a doctorate and to head a major university. He had spent decades as a college professor—in an age when someone in that role was not a performer struggling to draw students’ attention away from their cell phones, but a source of moral authority, like a member of the clergy. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=450))
- He had been born in Virginia, to a minister father who preached that the Bible sanctified slavery. By the time he was two, his father had become pastor of a congregation in Augusta, Georgia, where he would serve as a chaplain to Confederate troops and convert his church into a hospital for their wounded. When Wilson was eight, his entire appalled family watched as Union soldiers led Jefferson Davis, president of the defeated Confederacy, through the streets of Augusta on his way to prison. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=460))
- IF THERE WAS a single moment that epitomized the frenzy unleashed in these years, it was when the chief justice of the United States leapt to his feet and wept tears of joy at the certainty of war. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=488))
- over a 60-year period, Mississippi would have the highest per capita rate of lynchings in the country. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=507))
- his ambassador to London had telegraphed Washington a warning that if the country did not enter the conflict, not only might the Allies collapse, but with them any chance that Americans who had bought British and French war bonds would ever get their money back. By this point Britain alone owed the United States more than $2.7 billion—as a percentage of US gross domestic product, equal to roughly a trillion dollars a century later. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=515))
- Perhaps our going to war is the only way in which our present preeminent trade position can be maintained and a panic averted.” ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=522))
- an unbroken economic expansion that would last nearly four years, increasing the gross national product by more than 25 percent, and rescuing the nation from a 1914 recession so severe that the New York Stock Exchange had shut down for four months. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=629))
- Congress over going to war had not been without dissent. It cut across party lines, for both the Democrats and Republicans of this era had progressive and conservative wings. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=641))
- he asked pointedly, if this was a war for democracy, why was it that “the President has not suggested that we make our support of Great Britain conditional to her granting home rule to Ireland, or Egypt, or India?” ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=650))
- Daylight Saving Time was born, to decrease the need for electricity. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=686))
- To his navy secretary, the president said, “War means autocracy. . . . We shall be dependent upon the steel, oil and financial magnates. They will run the country.” ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=694))
- They included several high officials of J. P. Morgan & Co., already a lynchpin of the war economy. The giant investment bank had holdings in more than a dozen major military contractors, had floated loans to Britain and France, and won the lucrative contract to be the purchasing agent for the river of war supplies flowing to those two countries, collecting a 1 percent commission on everything purchased; 2 percent on some goods. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=696))
- However enthusiastic Americans felt about the war effort, paying for it and profiting from it only widened the country’s already severe gap between rich and poor—something that would have explosive results. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=730))
- Woodrow Wilson was not against all immigrants; after all, his own mother and all four of his grandparents had been born in the British Isles. Remarkably, however, that did not stop him from claiming that he was “bred, and . . . proud to have been bred, in the old revolutionary stock which set this government up.” For him and millions of others, being of British and Protestant descent felt equivalent to having ancestral entitlement to America, ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=773))
- less than two decades later US soldiers would use distinct echoes of this form of torture on their fellow Americans. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=840))
- Many leading Bolsheviks, however, including Lenin, the dominant figure, were in exile in Switzerland. The German high command therefore made a high-risk gamble. It arranged for Lenin and a group of his comrades to travel to Russia, via the sealed train that sped them through Germany without giving them any chance to stop and preach revolution on the way. From a German Baltic port, the group would travel on, via Sweden and Finland, by ship, train, and sleigh, to the Russian capital, Petrograd. While Bolshevik revolutionary fervor might be dangerously contagious, the Germans calculated that if Lenin gained power it would be worth the risk, because he would pull his country out of the war. This, of course, would free up hundreds of thousands of German troops to attack the Allies in France and Belgium before enough Americans could be mobilized and trained to help them. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=892))
- He saw himself as virtuously defending the traditional social order against rebels of all sorts at home and revolutionary ideologies from abroad. Deeply suspicious of immigrants, he always demanded an ethnic breakdown of any group under his surveillance. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=928))
- The government’s actions soon moved beyond surveillance. Wars are always an excuse to restrict freedom of speech—this had occurred during the Civil War, for instance—and it happened on an ominous scale in 1917. The most damaging blow came from a new law that, amended, is still in effect today, the Espionage Act, which Congress passed in mid-June. Despite its name, it had almost nothing to do with spies. Both opponents and supporters saw it for what it was: a club to smash left-wing forces of all kinds. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=942))
- The act defined opposition to the war of almost any sort as criminal. The penalties were draconian: “a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.” ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=948))
- For, at a time when there was no other way to distribute publications nationally, it gave to the postmaster general the authority to declare any newspaper or magazine “unmailable.” That power could not have landed in more dangerous hands. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=959))
- Burleson was eager to undo such lapses as having white and Black workers sorting letters in the same railway mail car, or using the same restrooms (“intolerable”), or having white and Black patrons line up at the same post office window. He segregated postal lunchrooms, and in work areas ordered screens erected so that white employees would not have their view sullied by Black workers. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=967))
- “Woe be to the man or group of men that seeks to stand in our way in this day of high resolution,” the president continued, “when every principle we hold dearest is to be vindicated and made secure for the salvation of the nations.” It was that distinctively Wilsonian note again, “the nations”: The United States, as he saw it, had embarked on a sacred mission not just for itself, but for the entire world. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1286))

- Battling organized labor, in fact, had long been routine for the National Guard, which in the half century before 1917 had been mobilized more than 100 times to put down strikes. By the late 1800s, half of all National Guard actions involved labor disputes. Business groups funded many National Guard units outright. Chicago businessmen even purchased a grand home for a general who had put down a big railway strike. ([Location 1314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1314))
- Some of the fortresslike armories still found in American cities were built with direct contributions from business groups, at times when the country was not fighting any wars overseas. Although many of these handsome redbrick buildings are used for conventions, museum exhibits, theatrical performances, dances, or wedding receptions today, we forget that they embody an era when labor organizing was met with military force. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1317))
- Many mainstream trade unions, by contrast, turned away women, Blacks, and the unskilled, and wanted to keep wages higher by curbing immigration. ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1343))
- The temperature reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit that day, as the vigilantes held the captured men for several hours on a baseball field. When threatened by Greenway, who was on horseback and brandishing a rifle, hundreds of miners agreed to go back to work. At bayonet point, the posse packed 1,186 men who refused to do so into a train of two dozen freight and cattle cars—the latter with several inches of manure on their floors—which hauled them 180 miles under the desert sun across the state line into New Mexico. Armed guards rode atop each car, and more armed men escorted the train in automobiles. After two days without food, the strikers were herded into an army stockade, from which they eventually were released. Any who tried to return to Bisbee were promptly arrested. For several months to come, no one could enter or leave the town without a special pass. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1408))
- The filmmaker was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of $5,000 and ten years in prison. “He shook like an aspen,” reported the Los Angeles Times, “as Judge Bledsoe verbally excoriated him for his unpatriotic conduct.” Whatever happened in 1776, the judge declared, “we are engaged in a war in which Great Britain is an ally of the United States,” and this was no time for “sowing dissension among our people” or “creating animosity . . . between us and our allies.” Goldstein’s sentence would not be commuted until long after the war ended. He would serve nearly three years behind bars, most of it in the isolated McNeil Island Penitentiary in Puget Sound. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1457))
- Theodore Roosevelt declared that “the clergyman who does not put the flag above the church had better close his church and keep it closed.” ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1466))

- From Oklahoma to New Jersey, crowds tarred and feathered people who refused to buy war bonds, calling them “bond slackers.” A Pennsylvania steelworker who failed to donate to the Red Cross had his head dunked in a barrel of red paint by his fellow workers. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1468))
- Now, from an office suite provided for free by Commonwealth Edison, Chicago’s giant utility, Briggs and Crockett set out to found American Protective League chapters across the nation. It was a hierarchical, overwhelmingly male organization and in practice, if not officially, was all white: officers politely turned down a membership application from a 51-year-old self-described “Colored man” in San Francisco. Organized along military lines, each local branch had a chief who commanded captains, lieutenants, and mere operatives. Cities were divided into zones—New York, for example, had 12—and in turn districts, which multiplied the opportunity for positions of command. There was a cloak-and-dagger thrill as well, for APL members sometimes had code names, like A-372 or B-49. For men beyond military age seeking martial glory, it was a dream fulfilled. ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1513))
- Of the more than 2,000 cases the government prosecuted under the Espionage Act, only ten would involve people accused of being actual German agents. The APL never uncovered a single such person. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1553))
- BUSINESS ENTHUSIASM FOR the American Protective League had nothing to do with German spies. Moguls like Ford saw the organization as a powerful new tool for fighting organized labor, especially the Wobblies. In a Chicago APL unit whose commander affectionately called his men “soldiers of darkness,” one member posed as a reporter for a Wobbly newspaper; others tapped Wobbly telephones. Even though they sometimes wore suits and ties, APL men were vigilantes. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1555))
- At least a hundred persons whose patriotism has been under suspicion were made to kiss the American flag in public.” The mob tarred and feathered another Staunton resident when he refused to buy a Red Cross pin. ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1569))
- “The most dangerous type of propaganda . . . is religious pacifism, i.e., opposition to the war on the ground that it is opposed to the word of God,” a high Justice Department official warned the House Judiciary Committee. ([Location 1581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1581))

- The town’s air was so filled with arsenic-laden smoke from copper smelting that sometimes streetlamps burned during the day. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1597))
- Butte’s police chief was so enthusiastic a superpatriot that he demanded that all his officers spend a month’s salary on war bonds, to prove they were “red-blooded American enough” to deserve their jobs. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1640))
- As the First World War’s manufacturing boom promised more jobs in the industrial centers of the North, it speeded up that migration. And it unleashed other events as well, which would make the next few years some of the bloodiest for Black Americans since the end of slavery, forming a new front in the war at home. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1676))
- At the national level, too, leading Democrats portrayed the Great Migration as a plot to import Republican voters to traditionally Democratic cities. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1701))
- “sundown town,” ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1706))
- White labor unions had been pressing hard for higher wages—and had thought they now had a chance of success because the war had dried up the stream of new immigrants from overseas willing to work for low pay. But suddenly here were Blacks glad to do so, for whom the meager existing wages might be double what they had earned as southern farmworkers. ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1710))
- As the carnage grew, the crowds set fire to more than a dozen blocks of a Black neighborhood and then used guns to prevent residents from fleeing the inferno. The mob blocked fire engines trying to get through, ensuring the destruction of 245 buildings, almost all of them Black homes, shops, and businesses or flimsy shanties where penniless new migrants had lived. It was as if the flames, which were visible for miles, unleashed all inhibitions and spurred the crowds on. White rioters tossed a Black child into the fire. When the crowd discovered a Black man who had tried to hide in a large wooden box, they nailed it shut and threw it, too, into the flames. ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1734))
- The clearest sign of the slowly changing balance of power between the sexes was that the overall American divorce rate, though low by today’s standards, more than tripled between 1890 and 1920. Many women were no longer including the word “obey” in their wedding vows, and the spread of information about birth control—even though illegal—was giving them more control over their reproductive lives. ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=1947))
- The indictment charged that O’Hare had said that American women had become “brood sows to raise children to get into the army and be made into fertilizer.” This, the judge declared, impeded the war effort because “the only way to win a war [is] to have soldiers.” The prosecutor called O’Hare “a dangerous woman” because she was “shrewd and brainy.” Her assertiveness as a woman was clearly as infuriating to judge and prosecutor as her opposition to the war. Yet, doubtless to their frustration, they couldn’t denounce her in the same way they might have condemned Emma Goldman, for O’Hare was the mother of four and said she hated capitalism because it destroyed the family. ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2006))
- Another of the Fourteen Points was not quite as noble as it sounded: “a free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims.” Surely that would not include the claim of any African colonies to independence from their European masters, or of the Philippines from the United States, or of Ireland from Britain. (Indeed, authorities in New York had recently used the Espionage Act to shut down meetings of an organization called the Friends of Irish Freedom.) But for other territory, it was self-determination all the way: the peoples of the sprawling, multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire should have the right to autonomy, and a new “independent Polish state” should be carved out of the territory where Poles now lived, in Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia. ([Location 2091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2091))
- Within less than a year after the passage of the Espionage Act, “the Cardinal” had deemed 44 American periodicals entirely “unmailable,” a total that would soon include some 30 more. He also banned, or singled out for warnings to publishers, specific issues of many more. The Nation earned his wrath for criticizing a labor leader who was a key Wilson ally; The Public, a progressive Chicago weekly, for urging that the government raise money by taxes instead of loans, to put more of the burden on the wealthy; and the Black Amsterdam News when it complained that Black soldiers were dying for the rights of Serbs and Poles in Europe while they risked being lynched at home. ([Location 2112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2112))
- Southern postmasters were particularly likely to do this when widely read Black periodicals like the Chicago Defender or Du Bois’s The Crisis published exposés of lynching. ([Location 2120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2120))
- Sometimes, after banning an issue or two of a periodical, the postmaster general would then declare that, because it had not been publishing regularly, it was no longer entitled to second-class mailing privileges. ([Location 2124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2124))
- When the San Antonio Inquirer, a Black newspaper in Texas, published a letter that the Justice Department thought too sympathetic to some Black soldiers who had mutinied, the paper’s editor was sentenced to two years in the Leavenworth penitentiary. ([Location 2127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2127))
- He also seized and banned 600 copies of a pamphlet, Why Freedom Matters, not because it criticized the war—it didn’t—but because it attacked censorship. He found “unmailable” no less than 14 pamphlets published by the National Civil Liberties Bureau, soon to become the American Civil Liberties Union.

- Although Vietnam is the conflict we associate with draft refusal, “a higher percentage of American men,” writes the historian Michael Kazin, “successfully resisted conscription during World War I.” ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=2223))
- One notorious torment for the COs who refused to work was to shackle their wrists to cell bars and so force them to stand on tiptoe for the eight hours a day they were supposed to be working. Maurice Becker, a former illustrator and cartoonist for the shuttered Masses, endured this and left a dark charcoal drawing: the bodies of three men are suspended from shackles, their muscles stretched taut, the head of one bent down in despair. The tableau is a haunting echo of the crucifixion of Jesus and the two thieves. Known as “high cuffing,” the practice could cut off blood flow and leave a prisoner’s wrists and hands injured.

- During 1917 and 1918, prosecutors convicted more than 1,000 men and women under the Espionage and Sedition Acts for voicing criticisms of the war effort or the government. Although some were able to overturn verdicts on appeal, most went to prison. Many additional people were sentenced under the raft of similar state and municipal sedition laws passed during this period.

- The organization staged additional raids over the months ahead, rounding up 1,000 men in Des Moines; 250 in New Orleans; 1,000 in Cleveland; and 600 in Atlantic City, where league members stood at the exit of each oceanside pier and would not let men leave unless they could show their draft cards.

- Chicago, the APL’s birthplace, saw the biggest raid to date, with more than 10,000 league members participating. At movie theaters, vaudeville shows, and a Cubs doubleheader, the raiders made everyone file out of designated exits, where each draft-age man had to show his card. Badge-wearing vigilantes checked every arriving train or steamboat, and combed parks, bars, restaurants, elevated train stations, and nightclubs. They stopped cars to question drivers and passengers and even appeared at the beaches in bathing suits, wading into Lake Michigan to interrogate suspects. Of the more than 150,000 men grilled, the APL took one in ten into custody to investigate their draft status.

- the Roosevelt sons were not all poster boys. Kermit became an alcoholic; Archibald would later take up extreme right-wing conspiracy theories; and Quentin had an odd obsession with witchcraft. But they played the role of heroes that the American public wanted. Archibald was wounded when German shrapnel mutilated his arm and knee. Theodore Jr. was gassed and hit by a German bullet in his leg. Kermit, who had won the Military Cross from Britain while attached to its army in Mesopotamia, now transferred to an American unit in France.

- The defendants were accused of conspiring to violate the Espionage Act and the Selective Service Act—laws that had not even been passed when the conspiracy supposedly started.

- such a long and complex trial, a jury normally would take time to reexamine exhibits entered in evidence, reread the 43-page indictment, and review the months of testimony. Knowing this, the chief defense lawyer went to his hotel for what he must have hoped would be some rest. In less than an hour, though, the jury sent word that it had reached verdicts. The deliberations, if they can even be called that, were so swift that only a single lawyer from the defense’s legal team had made it back to the courtroom when Judge Landis assembled the defendants, plus an extra contingent of police, to hear from the jury. It found all the Wobblies guilty on all counts. As they filed away in handcuffs, one of the defense attorneys, Caroline Lowe, broke into tears.

- Then a man would walk onstage and give a short, punchy oration, about the need for vigilance, planting victory gardens, or the latest successes of brave American troops at the front. These were the Four Minute Men, and they were indeed almost all men. There were 75,000 of them, all volunteers. Besides movie theaters, the Four Minute Men held forth at Rotary and Kiwanis luncheons, county fairs, Indian reservations, women’s clubs, churches, synagogues, labor union meetings, band concerts, between innings at the World Series, revival tents, and some 500 logging camps. Junior Four Minute Men spoke in schools, and College Four Minute Men on campuses. A corps of Colored Four Minute Men spoke in Black churches. More Four Minute Men gave speeches in Yiddish, Italian, Polish, Lithuanian, Armenian, and other languages. A group of speakers who gave longer talks were informally dubbed Four Hour Men.

- Already the party’s most popular woman, Kate Richards O’Hare, had been sentenced under the Espionage Act. In short order, the government used the same tool to indict, in various states, officials of the party and candidates it had run for office. It also tried, though eventually failed, to jail Victor Berger of Wisconsin, the first Socialist elected to Congress. To boot, Burleson’s Post Office, which had already barred most Socialist Party newspapers from the mail, now stopped delivering letters to and from the party’s Chicago headquarters and some state and local offices as well. This was a damaging blow in an era when the only other means of communication between cities were costly telegrams or long-distance telephone calls.

- he was more popular in Europe than in America, where the still-influential Theodore Roosevelt loudly denounced “Mr. Wilson and his Fourteen Points and his four supplementary points and his five complementary points.” Furthermore, Wilson’s Democrats had just lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1918 midterm elections, only weeks before his departure.

- Inspired by the president’s talk of self-determination, emissaries from every corner of the earth vied for his attention: Jews wanting a homeland in Palestine, Polish peasants in black fur caps with a priest translating their pleas into French, Mohandas Gandhi arguing for Indian independence, Lawrence of Arabia and sheiks in keffiyehs reminding him that the Allies had promised freedom to the Arabs, and a young Vietnamese patriot and kitchen worker in Paris who would later adopt the name Ho Chi Minh.

- Although the crowds in the snowy streets were thrilled to welcome him, national leaders were less enthusiastic, for at the top of the president’s to-do list was his vision for the League of Nations. It was not, however, high on anyone else’s agenda. Wilson, it was said, was someone who had brought a Bible to a poker game.

- Wood saw the world in stark terms: on one side were Americans, especially “old stock” Americans—he let audiences know that he was a Mayflower descendant—while on the other were Bolsheviks, socialists, anarchists, labor agitators, and a menacing tidal wave of immigrants. All of them, he hinted, he could vanquish as decisively as he had put down Apache and Filipino rebels. ([Location 3234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3234))
- declare for a League of Nations, I would be opposed to it.” It never seems to have occurred to Wilson that the censorship, political imprisonments, and harsh crackdown on antiwar dissidents he had presided over for nearly two years had not nurtured a climate of enthusiasm for a peace-oriented, internationalist idea like the league. His plan was for the league to be embedded in the peace treaty, but according to the Constitution, the Senate would have to approve any treaty America signed by a two-thirds margin. With his usual tin ear for political bargaining, Wilson had ignored suggestions that he include in the massive American delegation to the peace talks influential senators from both parties. Returning to Paris confident as ever, the president resumed negotiating. But the talks progressed slowly, in part because, as Lloyd George said, “He was not accustomed to confer with equals.” ([Location 3304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3304))

- Starvation and malnutrition claimed the lives of an estimated 478,500 German civilians, and millions more suffered hunger and lasting aftereffects. The average German boy or girl in 1918 was more than an inch shorter than in 1914. On top of these privations, Germany, like all of Europe, had been swept by the influenza epidemic.

- Wilson had sent some 13,000 American troops to Russia—including several hundred draftees from La Follette’s own Wisconsin—who were now supporting one side in Russia’s all-engulfing civil war. If the United States assumed a right to jump into such a complex and distant conflict, waging undeclared war, where would such interventions end? La Follette’s question has continued to echo for more than a century. ([Location 3357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3357))
- The negotiations continued, but now Lloyd George and Clemenceau came to Wilson’s bedroom to talk. These two canny politicians knew how attached he was to his beloved league, and they used it to bargain for what they wanted. They had another advantage over him as well: the French prime minister was in his own capital and Lloyd George only a half day’s journey from his, while their American counterpart was an ocean away from Washington and incapable of easily rousing political support in the Senate, which would have to approve any treaty. ([Location 3375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3375))
- There would be severe reparations; Germans would have to accept full responsibility for starting the war; France would be able to mine the Saar coalfields; Italy would win part of the Austrian Tyrol; and Germany would lose territory containing about 10 percent of its population and a larger proportion of its coal and iron ore. A portion of Germany, East Prussia, would be separated from the rest of the country because the new nation of Poland needed a corridor to the Baltic Sea. Germany’s overseas possessions, stretching from Togoland in West Africa to New Guinea in the Pacific, would be parceled out among no less than eight Allied nations. Officially, they would be called “mandates,” although colonies they remained. Wilson’s League of Nations would still be in the treaty, but there were few remnants of the president’s call for a “peace without victory.” ([Location 3383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3383))
- Appeals to patriotism had helped restrain labor militance on both sides during the war. But now that the conflict was over, old discontents reemerged, exacerbated by the privations and shortages the war had left and the example, or so it appeared, of workers in Russia who had seized power for themselves.

- Protests against British colonial rule flamed up in India, Egypt, and close to home in Ireland, where before long the government would rush extra police and thousands of soldiers. ([Location 3402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3402))
- While Wilson labored on, the treaty still not completed, across the Atlantic the United States was suffering its stormiest year since the aftermath of the Civil War. Behind much of the discontent was a soaring rate of inflation. From 1917 to 1920, the Consumer Price Index rose more than 40 percent. For food, the increase was over 50 percent, and for household furnishings almost 100 percent. Doctors raised their fees, and many grocery stores and small businesses stopped giving credit. Although workers had shared some of the prosperity of the war manufacturing boom, wages in many industries still lagged behind.

- The turmoil further inflamed those Americans who had long believed that if there was trouble, it must be caused by foreigners or immigrants. A graphic illustration of this was an unusual map produced in early 1919 by Military Intelligence. It divided portions of New York City into zones of 11 different colors, highlighting which dangerous ethnic group lived where: red for “Russian Jews,” orange for Italians, green for Irish, black for “Negro.” The map was also sprinkled with numbered blue stars and white circles. The 86 circles marked the locations of union headquarters, IWW halls, and other places “where radical meetings are held,” while the 44 blue stars identified offices of “radical and liberal” publications, from the Inter-Collegiate Socialist to the literary and political journal The Dial and the NAACP’s The Crisis. The map was the brainchild of the Military Intelligence chief for the city, 40-year-old Captain John B. Trevor. Of Trevor, a critical journalist once wrote, “If a man’s love for his country is measurable by his detestation of all who had the bad taste to be born elsewhere, there probably is no greater patriot in America to-day.” ([Location 3470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3470))
- The newly formed American Legion demanded the expulsion not only of noncitizens who had evaded wartime military service, but of all men who had done so. Furthermore, why should merely being born in the United States confer citizenship? The Anti-Alien League called for this right to be denied to “peoples of Asiatic races,” and a senator from Washington State announced that he would introduce such a bill. ([Location 3569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3569))
- Another facet of growing anti-immigrant fervor was a deep suspicion of foreign languages. After all, if you couldn’t understand what people were saying, it might be something un-American. An Iowa senator called for “a one-language nation.” The American Legion Weekly demanded that this one language be called “American.” ([Location 3572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3572))

- Wilson was further handicapped because he was no natural politician. “There can seldom have been a statesman of the first rank more incompetent than the President in the agilities of the council chamber,” wrote John Maynard Keynes, who had observed him closely in Paris. “A moment often arrives when substantial victory is yours if by some slight appearance of a concession you can save the face of the opposition.” But Wilson could never manage this—in Paris or in Washington. Bargaining felt beneath him. ([Location 3671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3671))

- In the United States at this time there were more than seven million foreign-born men and women who had not become naturalized as citizens. Some had never done so because the bureaucracy involved seemed intimidating for those who spoke little English. To others, formal citizenship hadn’t felt important when the country seemed to welcome newcomers. ([Location 3775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3775))
- Over several days, looking for victims wherever they could find them, the mob killed at least 13 Blacks, one of them a farmworker named Hayes Turner. The next day, his wife, Mary, eight months pregnant, made what a Georgia newspaper called “unwise remarks . . . about the execution of her husband.” The mob strung her up to a tree by her ankles, doused her with gasoline, and set her on fire. As she screamed in pain, a member of the mob knifed open her belly, and when her unborn child fell to the ground and gave a cry, men stomped it to death. When her remains and those of her child were buried, the grave was marked, triumphantly, by a whisky bottle stoppered with a cigar. The mob included the foreman of the county’s grand jury. No one was ever prosecuted. ([Location 3887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3887))
- More than 70 Black Americans would be hanged by mobs—or, in 11 cases, burned alive—in 1919, the highest total in over a decade. Seventeen of them were veterans, at least three of whom were in uniform when murdered. ([Location 3904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3904))
- Something else that aroused whites was that those 380,000 Black veterans were competing with them for scarce jobs, threatening to depress wages. And the same fuel that had fed the attacks on Blacks in East St. Louis two years earlier remained, for the Great Migration continued unabated, enraging white northerners who found these newcomers moving into previously all-white neighborhoods. More battles exploded in the hot summer months of 1919, north and south. The United States had seen plenty of murderous violence against immigrants, Wobblies, and other militant labor unionists. But that was surpassed by the fury the country mustered against Black people. ([Location 3916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=3916))
- Looking for work, Black migrants carrying their belongings in bundles or flimsy suitcases continued to pour into the city, their numbers more than doubling over the course of the decade. In addition, hundreds of southern Black servicemen were released from the army in Chicago but not given train fare home. Nor did some of them want to return to homes in the South, when week after week newspapers reported lynchings in garish detail, including the way white crowds cheered as they cut off and flourished body parts from a Black corpse. Not surprisingly, the counties with the most lynchings often produced the greatest number of Blacks fleeing north.

- conditions or wages. The Red Scare showed no signs of abating. In Hammond, Indiana, a man went on trial for having shot dead a leftist who had said, “To hell with the United States.” A jury took two minutes to find him not guilty.

- in “a large bobsled drawn by two fast steeds.” There are no complete records of how many people were seized and interrogated in the raids of November 1919, January 1920, and the smaller roundups that followed, but several estimates place the total at about 10,000. Presumably excluding slavery, the historian Alan Brinkley calls the Palmer Raids “arguably the greatest single violation of civil liberties in American history.” And Palmer promised that deportations by the tens of thousands would follow.

- Despite the astonished protests of the five, in short order the rest of the assembly, Republicans and Democrats alike—only two brave Democrats dissented—voted to declare the five seats vacant. When the five refused to leave the chamber, the sergeant at arms escorted them out, one by one. ([Location 4660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=4660))
- elected again to the House of Representatives in 1918. The House refused to let him take his seat, declaring it vacant. Wisconsin then held a special election to fill the seat, electing Berger again. On January 10, 1920, three days after the New York State Legislature ejected the Socialists, the House again expelled him.

- Henry George and a leading figure in George’s single-tax movement, which called for spreading the national wealth by treating all land as owned in common and taxing those who used it. Single-taxers were not socialists, but shared with them a passion for reducing the vast inequalities of the Gilded Age.

- Then Post discovered that many of the agents making Palmer Raid arrests had done so without the deportation warrants that had to be issued by the Labor Department, or with warrants based on faulty information. He swiftly invalidated nearly 3,000 of those arrests, finding, for instance, one case in which a prisoner was held for two weeks before anyone even asked for a warrant for his arrest. And the raiders had not informed many of those seized that their answers could be used as evidence against them; nor were those arrested given access to lawyers.

- His name had caught the eye of the Justice Department because one of the Communist parties had mailed him a membership card. But he had never been to a meeting. Agents arrested him with no warrant, questioned him with no lawyer present, told him no reason for his arrest, and held him in jail for a week until he managed to produce $1,000 bail. And now he was slated to be deported. “In a large proportion of cases I have examined,” Post told the press, “there is no better reason for deportation than is disclosed in the present case.” ([Location 4823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=4823))
- The illusion of a sinister radical menace guarantees big budgets. This pattern would continue until the very end of Hoover’s long career, by which point 15 percent of the US Communist Party’s tiny membership would consist of undercover FBI agents.

- searched homes and arrested people without warrants, interrogated them without attorneys, set wildly excessive bail, accepted rides from some 20 nondeputized vigilantes, and corralled people who were US citizens as well as those who were not. “More lawless proceedings are hard to conceive,” declared the judge.

- In a widely quoted passage from his excoriating 30,000-word decision, he declared that “a mob is a mob, whether made up of government officials acting under instructions from the Department of Justice, or of criminals, loafers, and the vicious classes.” ([Location 5090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=5090))

- The Twelve Lawyer Report was widely distributed and had considerable impact in Congress. The press covered it respectfully, often on its front pages, and it would turn out to be something of a milestone in the history of American civil liberties; it is still cited in legal writings today.

- rival politician once called Harding’s verbiage “an army of pompous phrases moving over the landscape in search of an idea.

- Restricting the total only to those jailed for a year or more by the federal government between 1917 and 1921 for their written or spoken words, the author Stephen Kohn, a lawyer, has counted 462 men and women. “The number of political dissidents who served less than a year in prison,” he cautions, “is simply too great to document.” ([Location 5387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=5387))
- an even greater number than those in federal custody: political prisoners incarcerated in county jails or state penitentiaries. A majority of states had passed copycat laws in the wake of the Espionage Act, and many cities, like Boston and New York, also rushed to do the same. No one has ever counted the total number of people jailed under such laws. ([Location 5390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=5390))
- 1924, with the passage of the Johnson-Reed Act. Until it was abandoned more than 40 years later, the act placed the most severe restrictions on immigration in American history. It barred Asians from the country entirely, and it parceled out only a tiny quota of slots to other immigrants.

- The law he and Trevor crafted would bar from the United States untold numbers of refugees from the Holocaust, leaving them to end their lives in Hitler’s death camps. When a proposal was under discussion in 1939 that would have made an exception to the Johnson-Reed Act to allow 20,000 Jewish refugee children to enter the country, one of those who led the successful fight against it was Trevor, who declared that he wanted “to protect the youth of America from this foreign invasion.” ([Location 5485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=5485))

- On Memorial Day 1927, a march of some 1,000 Klansmen through the New York City borough of Queens turned into a brawl with the police. Several people wearing Klan hoods were arrested, one of them a young real estate developer named Fred Trump. Ninety years later, his son, with similar feelings about people of color, would enter the White House. ([Location 5564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09PGFLR2B&location=5564))
