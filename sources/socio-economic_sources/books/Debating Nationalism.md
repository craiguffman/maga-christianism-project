### Highlights

- the UN and its predecessor are misnomers reflecting the confusion between state and nation. Similarly, many use the word “nation” to describe a state. This is also reflected in other languages. In German, for example, international law is known as Völkerrecht, literally the law of peoples. Similarly, the terms “nationality” and “citizenship” are often used interchangeably. This creates particular confusion in multinational states, where nationality is not identical to the citizenship held.

- As German historian Peter Alter noted, nationalism is usually seen in moral terms as aggressive and negative, unlike other concepts such as “national interest” or “national pride.” ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=99))

- However, the dichotomy between a “positive patriotism” that evokes universalist values and a “selfish nationalism” reflects a common misunderstanding. Nationalism and patriotism are not opposites but are intrinsically linked. “Patriotism is a form of nationalism. They are ideological brothers, not distant cousins,” noted the Swiss sociologist Andreas Wimmer (1962– ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=109))

- The British writer Samuel Johnson is said to have remarked in 1775 that “patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.” ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=114))

- Nationalism emphasizes membership in a particular group: a nation. Its opposite is not patriotism but rather universalism. Whereas universalism stresses commonalities among all of humanity and explores cooperation among all humans, nationalism emphasizes proximity and cooperation among the members of one nation, no matter how it is defined.

- First, all modern political ideologies can be considered to have both nationalist and universalist expressions. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=134))

- Second, this distinction is also visible in how nationalist groups and movements oppose universalists, or others accused of not belonging to the nation. This pattern can be recognized in the recent rise of nationalist populism, which often demonizes “globalist elites.” ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=138))

- At best, the objective criteria of nations can identify features which are partially shared by most members of most nations and thus give an indication of the grounds on which nations emerge. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=170))

- Shared solidarity and the ability to perceive others as members of the same community is crucial. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=188))

- The crucial question of when a nation is a nation is not a matter of fact, but rather, of mutually agreed fiction. This fiction is constituted by the mutual agreement of members of a community to belong to the same nation. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=195))

- Accordingly, belonging to a nation stands at the intersection between individual choice and collective acceptance. Individuals have to identify with a nation, but this identification requires the consent of the larger community to be effective.

- One can define nationalism as a malleable and narrow ideology that values membership in a nation more highly than belonging to other groups (i.e., based on gender, political ideology, socio-economic group, region), seeks distinction from other nations, strives to preserve the nation, and gives preference to political representation by the nation for the nation ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=243))

- Nationalism’ significance and centrality in the lives of a community and its individual members are not fixed and will alter. Such a circumstantial variation of nationalism is best described through a distinction between “latent” and “virulent” nationalism. Latent nationalism is ubiquitous and sometimes hard to notice: it can serve both to include migrants or exclude minorities, but is constant and steady, described by Michael Billig as “banal nationalism,” an endemic condition that shapes society. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=249))

- Virulent nationalism rejects the status quo and seeks to reassert the will of an imagined community over a political or cultural space. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=263))

- It is misleading to talk of nationalism as a singular phenomenon. Within a given community there are often competing nationalisms, which define the nation differently and also incorporate other ideologies, from the Left or the Right.

- The most important distinction made in this respect is that between civic and ethnic nationalism. The categorization was introduced by Hans Kohn (1891–1971), an American historian born in Prague, in his influential The Idea of Nationalism, written during the Second World War, where he distinguished between Eastern and Western nationalism. The Eastern variant, according to Kohn, is defined by illiberal and exclusionary dynamics, and the Western as being more inclusive and based on civic criteria.

- Civic nationalism is defined by citizenship, whereby all citizens are members of the nation. Ethnic nationalism is defined by descent, where only those who are born into the nation are members of the community, and citizenship is irrelevant.

- This distinction is commonly reflected in law as ius soli versus ius sangui: citizenship defined by the soil where one is born versus citizenship defined by blood—the citizenship of parents. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=291))

- Thus, minorities might be accommodated, but an ethnically defined nation will commonly preclude equal access to the state resources for those who are not members of the dominant nation. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=304))

- Today, the key marker of nationalism is its level of inclusion and exclusion, which might be based on the concept of descent but equally can be grounded in narratives of being “natives” of a particular land or holding a particular set of shared values.

- In fact, there is never just one nation or nationalism, civic or ethnic. Rather, each nation is constituted by competing nationalisms; competing and often conflicting ideas of how to define the nation. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=323))

- In essence, defining the nation is essentially an exercise in inclusion and exclusion. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=328))

- We can thus categorize nationalism along two axes: one, its level of inclusion and exclusion, and two, whether it is endemic or virulent (see Table 1.1 ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082XS5XKM&location=338))
