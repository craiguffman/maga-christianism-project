### Highlights

- WRITING SHORTLY AFTER the close of World War II, Harvard historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. spoke of the urgent need to fortify the “vital center” of the American polity against “centrifugal forces” that were threatening to tear it apart. By the “vital center,” he meant an alliance between “the non-Fascist Right” and “the non-Communist Left” that was based on a shared belief in liberal democracy.1 The “centrifugal forces” he spoke of emanated from rapid social change and radical ideologies. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=373))
- The chief failure of the Left was a sentimental belief in human goodness and historical progress that led it to underestimate the human capacity for evil. The chief failure of the Right was a callous indifference to the dislocations and injustices produced by industrial capitalism and a self-serving faith that the market would sort them out. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=378))
- Today, America’s vital center is threatened by a new set of centrifugal forces: by economic changes that are steadily widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots; by partisan politics that are drawing a new Mason Dixon line between “red states” and “blue states”; by the Great Recession, which lasted longer than the Great Depression; by a series of small wars that have left the nation anxious and depleted; and by a… ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=381))
- The vital center is also threatened by radical ideologies. Some are old, such as the revival of “states’ rights” arguments hailing from the antebellum South. Others are newer, such as the antistatist “techno-libertarianism” that has taken hold among some on… ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=385))
- The result of these changes is political dysfunction. Congress engages in unprecedented obstructionism. The executive branch responds with unprecedented unilateralism. Roads and bridges crumble. Cabinet posts go unfilled. Budgets get stuck in committee. Each side doubles down in the hope of scoring a knockout blow against the other. This endless… ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=387))
- What is needed is a new vital center, a coalition of nonchauvinists and nonlibertarians on the Left and the Right, a coalition of ordinary citizens premised on a common vision of the American project that… ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=391))
- The vital center is not a mushy middle that splits the difference between Left and Right. It is a living tradition that cuts across these divisions.

- Much of the shouting is coming from two directions. The first is American religious nationalism, a toxic blend of apocalyptic religion and imperial zeal that envisions the United States as a righteous nation charged with a divine commission to rid the world of evil and usher in the Second Coming. The other is American radical secularism, an equally noxious blend of cultural elitism and militant atheism that envisions the United… ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=398))
- Religious nationalism is not worthy of our allegiance. There are reasonable forms of nationalism, but religious nationalism is not one of them.

- Radical secularism is not worthy of our allegiance either. There are reasonable forms of secularism, too, but radical secularism is not one of them. At its core, radical secularism is little more than a misguided effort at cultural censorship, political illiberalism dressed up as liberal politics. Any serious liberal should reject it on the ground that liberal citizenship should not require that religious citizens shed their deepest beliefs before entering the public… ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=405))

- This situation has arisen in part because both sides have been supported by vocal and well-organized minorities, and in part because each tradition strongly confirms the other’s prejudices.

- They are concerned that church and state not become too entangled in one another’s affairs, but they do not believe you can take religion entirely out of politics, or vice versa. They know that the American project has a moral and spiritual core. They also value American culture and institutions enough to cherish and defend them but without succumbing to the conceit that America is always and everywhere a “force for… ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=415))
- But as a historical and cultural sociologist, I am equally convinced that thinkers and their ideas are always necessary to change power and institutions. They help us to express our highest ideals and to see how we fall short of them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=423))
- By a “tradition,” I mean a culture that is self-conscious of its past. To be part of a tradition is to know certain stories, read certain books, admire certain people, and care about certain things. It is to knowingly enter into an ongoing conversation, a conversation that precedes one’s birth and continues on after one’s death. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=426))
- Traditions have been forged and tested through historical experience and collective debate. Some traditions stand… ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=429))
- Traditions have to be evaluated not only in relationship to historical experience but also vis-à-vis rival traditions: other accounts of how the world is and should be. Evaluating traditions fairly is difficult. In this book, I have used three criteria: internal consistency, historical accuracy, and sociological plausibility. I have asked whether each tradition remains true to its own highest values, gives a… ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=430))

- The civil religious tradition passes these tests because it is neither idolatrous nor illiberal, because it recognizes both the sacred and the secular sources of the American creed, because it provides a political vision that can be embraced by believers and nonbelievers alike, and… ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=439))
- Let me put this less metaphorically. The foundations of a tradition are laid by certain people and composed of certain texts. To that degree, they are indeed fixed. But the meaning of those lives and texts is always and ever subject to debate. Even the names of the founders and the texts in a canon may be called into question. New founders and… ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=445))
- For some, “dynamism” is just another word for corruption. I am not of this view. I believe that the full meaning of a tradition is only gradually disclosed over time as its implications are worked out in various contexts. For example, I think it is fair to say that the American founders did not fully understand the… ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=448))
- Traditions really can be corrupted. Corruption occurs when the core values of a tradition are distorted to justify a particular status quo, as when equality is claimed to apply only to white, property-holding men. But sometimes change deepens or widens a tradition, making it more profound or inclusive. In this way, freedom of conscience was eventually understood to imply the free exercise of religious faith, and not only for Protestants. This sort… ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=452))
- Nor do I think that rationality is inherently opposed to tradition. I doubt that rationality in any deep sense is possible outside of a tradition, if by “tradition” we mean a certain language for talking about the world, and if by “rationality” we mean reasoning about ends as well as means. The various discourses of modernity—natural science, secular philosophy, abstract art, and so on—are all “traditions” in this sense. They tell us what we should strive for—be it truth or reason or beauty—and not just how to get there. It is therefore important to distinguish tradition in the sense I describe here from traditionalism in the sense of an instinctive resistance to change. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=460))
- Finally, I do not believe that tradition is inherently opposed to progress. Tradition often serves as an inspiration for change, and sometimes even as a source of radicalism. Civic republicanism is a very old tradition, for example; its roots go back at least to ancient Athens. Nevertheless, it provided one inspiration for the American Revolution, which was a very radical experiment indeed. Prophetic religion is an even older tradition; its roots go back to ancient Israel. But it provided one inspiration for the civil rights movement, another very radical movement. Again, we must be careful not to confuse tradition and traditionalism. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=464))
- What does it mean to be immersed in a tradition? A tradition is like a powerful river that cuts through a deep canyon. We can approach it in various ways. We can swim against the current, or we can just let it carry us along. We can also lie on our backs and gaze upward, wondering what lies above. All these are things we can do. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=474))
- What we assuredly cannot do is climb up out of the canyon and gaze down at the river from some God’s-eye perspective. For finite, cultural animals such as us, there is no “view from nowhere.” It is because of this that independent, critical thinking is not necessarily opposed to tradition. In fact, I would argue that it is really possible only for those who have mastered a tradition. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=476))
- To think critically within a tradition is to paddle to shore and walk upstream or downstream, reflecting on how the river and the canyon have shaped one another. To act critically within a tradition is to try to bend the river by altering the banks, or vice versa. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=479))
- My approach is critical insofar as it involves the evaluation of texts. I regard some interpretations as better than others, based on the three criteria enumerated previously. For example, I think Frederick Douglass’s and Abraham Lincoln’s interpretations of the nation’s founding documents are much better than John C. Calhoun’s (see chapter 4). And I think Reinhold Niebuhr’s interpretation of Nazism is infinitely superior to H. L. Mencken’s (see chapter 5). ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=488))
- I criticize some thinkers for a one-sided reading of the civil religious tradition. In this way, I criticize Hannah Arendt for ignoring the prophetic side of the tradition (see chapter 6), and I criticize Barack Obama for underplaying its republican side. I criticize other thinkers for corrupting the civil religious tradition (see chapter 7). In this vein, I criticize Jerry Falwell for exempting the Christian churches from his prophetic critiques, and I criticize Ronald Reagan for absolving the American people of their collective sins (again, see chapter 7). ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=492))
- Another brief note on method is also necessary here: the central concepts of this book—“civil religion,” “religious nationalism,” and “radical secularism”—are all “ideal types” in the two senses delineated by the great German sociologist Max Weber. First, they are “ideal types” in the sense of a series of “unified analytical constructs” that are “formed by the one-sided accentuation of certain points of view” so as to sharpen their contrasts with each other.2 An ideal type construct in this sense is a set of interrelated concepts that are more logically consistent within themselves and more sharply bounded off from one another than are the real phenomena to which they refer. In short, ideal types are useful exaggerations. By turning shades of gray into black and white, they make it easier for us to see real contrasts. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=496))
- These concepts are also “ideal types” in a second sense: they articulate contrasting sets of ethical and political ideals and clarify what is at stake when we choose between them. So one function of ideal types is to draw out the underlying assumptions of civil religion, religious nationalism, and radical secularism so that we can subject them to logical, historical, and ethical evaluation. Another is to more precisely locate the boundaries between them so that we know when we are crossing over from one side to the other—when, for instance, a laudable sort of civic patriotism is devolving into a dangerous form of political idolatry, or when a reasonable concern with individual freedom is shading off into a malignant type of radical individualism. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=503))
- At the same time, I have tried to write as plainly and directly as possible. This is not how professors are taught to write, and I have learned that it is not easy. As far as possible, I have tried to keep the academic jargon to a minimum and to confine scholarly debates to the endnotes or, where this is not possible, to define my terms in ordinary language and paint the academic debates in very broad strokes. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=514))
- Specialist readers who care about the scholarly debates can always turn to the notes, where they will easily discover my intellectual influences. Among other things, they will find that my interpretation of civic republicanism is shaped by the Cambridge School, that my understanding of the prophetic is similar to Walter Brueggemann’s, that my understanding of hermeneutics takes its cues from Paul Ricoeur, and that my theory of tradition is inspired by Alasdair MacIntyre and Jeff Stout. Nonspecialist readers who do not care about such things can simply read on. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=517))
- I have also structured the introductory and concluding sections of the book in a somewhat unusual way. The present introduction is addressed to a wide audience, and it may be all the introduction that many readers will want. In contrast, the next chapter is a bit more scholarly. It, too, is written for a general audience, but readers with a low tolerance for conceptual discussion may wish to skip it. The conclusion is likewise in two parts. Its first part, chapter 8, is, like chapter 1, a little more scholarly in tone. It contrasts civil religion with other political philosophies and political theologies, and argues that some of them are reasonable and others not. Readers who are not especially interested in political philosophy or political theology may want to skip directly to the conclusion proper, which sketches a vision of the righteous republic and considers how such an end might be achieved. I suspect that many academic readers will find chapters 1 and 8 much more interesting than the introduction and conclusion, while some political philosophers and theologians may find them to be the only interesting parts of the book. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=521))
- Chapter 2 is devoted to what I regard as America’s first founding: the establishment of Puritan New England. There, I argue that covenantal religion provided the basic blueprint for Puritan society; that the Puritan polity was proto-republican; that American religious nationalism first arose out of the Puritans’ wars with the Native Americans; and, finally, that Puritan society gave rise to proto-secularist views, but not radical secularist ones. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=535))
- Chapter 3 focuses on what I regard as America’s second founding: the American Revolution. There, I side with scholars who argue that the American revolutionaries were more influenced by civic republicanism than by “Lockean liberalism”; that the American founders generally saw Christianity and republicanism as complementary, rather than opposed; that the most influential model of republican government for most Americans was neither Rome nor Athens but Jerusalem; that apocalyptic religious nationalism was conspicuous mainly by its absence in this period; and that scholars who believe that radical secularism was the main inspiration for the American Constitution are seriously mistaken. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=538))
- Chapter 4 turns to what may be seen as America’s first refounding: the Civil War. It argues that Abraham Lincoln’s understanding of the American Constitution was initially quite similar to that of John C. Calhoun, the most articulate defender of Southern slavery and “states’ rights,” but that Lincoln’s thinking gradually converged around a new interpretation of the Constitution… ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=543))
- For Calhoun, the articles of the Constitution overrode the preamble, and the Constitution overrode the Declaration, while Douglass’s reading proceeded in the opposite direction: the preamble of the Declaration, with its promise of equality, overrode the articles of… ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=547))
- Chapter 4 also details important developments within the rival traditions. It discusses the emergence of a new rhetoric of “blood sacrifice” and “blood atonement,” first as a justification for the Civil War and later to legitimate American imperialism, and how this durably transformed American religious nationalism. It also discusses the new radical secularist movement that appeared… ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=549))
- In chapter 5, I fast-forward to a second period of social upheaval, the first half of the twentieth century. This chapter focuses on four Progressive Era intellectuals—John Dewey, Jane Addams, Reinhold Niebuhr, and W.E.B. Du Bois—and their respective responses to America’s increasing secularity, diversity, and power, as well as its continuing struggles over race. It also details the emergence of popular apocalypticism within American Christianity and discusses its influence on American religious nationalism via the example of Pentecostal… ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=553))
- In chapter 6, I turn my attention to the decades after World War II, the period of the “liberal consensus,” the civil rights movement, and the final collapse of the WASP ascendancy in American society. I show how Hannah Arendt challenged an increasingly technocratic style of liberal governance by returning to the Athenian roots of Western democracy, how Martin Luther King’s civic poetry wove several new strands into prophetic republicanism, and how John Courtney Murray incorporated Catholicism into the… ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=558))
- In chapter 7, I trace the interaction between the civil religious tradition and partisan politics from the Reagan era up through the present day. In brief, I argue that liberal Democrats like Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale jettisoned the civil religious tradition, while conservative Republicans like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush corrupted it. I also argue that Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign can be seen as an attempt to revive that tradition, albeit a one-sided and… ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=563))
- In chapter 8, I explain in greater detail why I regard the civil religious tradition as superior to its two main rivals and compare this tradition to several other closely related standpoints, including “liberal nationalism” and “constitutional patriotism.” Again,… ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=567))
- I have two answers to these concerns. The first is that I am addressing my readers as citizens first and scholars second. The second is that even a scholarly book’s method must be appropriate to its purposes. The purposes of this book are to recuperate a certain tradition within American political culture, to demonstrate that it has been a living and evolving tradition, and to identify certain exemplary figures within that tradition from whom we might still draw some measure of inspiration today. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=578))
- Let me briefly reiterate the reasons: To deepen our perspective on the present. Our current debates are often extensions of earlier debates that reach back to the founding generations and beyond. Consequently, revisiting past debates may help us to resolve present ones, or at least to understand them better. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=584))
- To provide hope for the future. Viewed through the lens of a single lifetime, our politics may seem hopelessly static. When viewed in cross-generational perspective, however, the slow and halting progress becomes more visible. History can be an antidote for cynicism. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=586))
- To provide a sturdier and more capacious frame for thinking about the American project. Nonacademics—which is to say, most people—do not usually reason in terms of abstract principles or values; they work through moral problems in terms of stories. Historical narratives help us to think about what should come next. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=590))
- Bellah may have injected the notion of civil religion into modern sociology, but he did not invent the concept. That honor goes to the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who proposed the establishment of a civil religion to secure his “social contract.” Looking back further still, although Rousseau may have introduced the idea of civil religion into political theory, the problem itself was already very old: how to coordinate the spiritual and secular kingdoms, or, in Jesus’s words, how to render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, and unto God what is his. The modern debate about civil religion is part of a debate about political theology that is as old as monotheism itself. ([Location 598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=598))
- Over the last three decades, there has been a massive resurgence of “public religion,” not only in the United States but also around the world.1 Meanwhile, there has been a rapid growth of the “religiously unaffiliated,” initially in Western Europe but increasingly in North America too. Simultaneously, there has been an unprecedented movement of people and ideas around the globe. American religion and culture have been carried to every corner of the planet, and not-yet-American religions and cultures have been imported into every corner of the nation. The result is a new level of cultural pluralism that goes well beyond denominational diversity within American Christianity. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=603))
- It provides an alternative to a reactionary traditionalism that seeks to restore cultural homogeneity and also to a radical individualism that seeks to dissolve all political bonds. It is perhaps the best starting point that we have for thinking about the future of America. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=609))
- One question I was asked repeatedly as I presented this argument before various audiences—a question that some readers may now be asking themselves—was “Why ‘civil religion’?” Secular audiences were often uncomfortable with the mention of “religion,” while religious audiences sometimes bristled at its conjunction with “civil.” Why not choose a more innocuous-sounding term, they asked? Perhaps something less irritating, like “public philosophy” or “political culture” or “civic creed”? ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=614))
- did not like the singular “political culture” either because it suggests one unified culture, as opposed to multiple and competing traditions; nor did I like the plural “political cultures,” which I found too static and unhistorical. “Civic creed” is perhaps the closest substitute I discovered, but it did not quite suit my purposes either—not because it leaves out the ritual aspects so important to civil religion, such as ceremonies, commemorations, parades, and so on, but because it lacks a narrative dimension. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=622))
- My account focuses more on stories. The civil religion is a narrative that tells us where we came from and where we are headed, not just what our commitments are. It embeds our values and commitments within particular stories of civic greatness—and collective failure. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=626))
- there is no denying that many regard “civil religion” as an irritating concept. But is that such a bad thing—especially if we understand “irritating” in the root sense of “disorienting”? Disorientation can lead to reflection, and perhaps it would be a good thing for the more secular minded to reflect on how their values are ultimately grounded in a certain “transcendent”… ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=628))
- As the late David Foster Wallace once put it, “In the day-to day trenches of adult life . . . [t]here is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.” Some may worship money and material things, others beauty and sexual… ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=632))
- A related hope is that the civil religion concept may help the more religiously minded to see that their values necessarily have a civic dimension, and that their highest values can really be protected and exercised only in a certain kind of civic community. If one places a high value on freedom of religion, for example—and most people of faith in this country do—then one must also respect freedom from religion as one possible result of the freedom of conscience. Not everyone will choose to worship “some sort of god or… ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=636))

- For the secularist, civil religion may be religious only in a historical or literary sense: historical insofar as contemporary progressivism owes a deep debt to the Hebrew prophets; literary insofar as the civil religion still supplies the lyric poetry of our public life.

- For the religionist, the civil religious tradition may also be religious in an ethical and even theological sense. If we really are all God’s children, as King was fond of saying, then we are also equal in the most fundamental sense possible. If we really are commanded to care for “the least of these,” as Matthew’s Gospel urges, then the pursuit of social justice has the force of a divine command.

- However, civil religion should not be confused with mere civility in the sense of “politeness.” The civil religionist is also concerned with the core values of the republic, and these may sometimes trump civic friendship. So the civil religionist will also be prepared to engage in civil disobedience when this is necessary.

- Bellah initially defined civil religion as the “religious dimension” of the “political realm.” Importantly, he understood civil religion as distinct from, but not necessarily opposed to, organized religion.9 In a later work, Bellah offered a more general definition: civil religion, he said, is the “founding myth” of a political community.

- Bellah’s understanding of civil religion should not be equated with Rousseau’s. It is different in a number of ways. First, it is voluntary rather than compulsory.

- Radical secularists insist that public life can and should be a “neutral” realm. What they really mean by this is that the public square must be made religion-free. This is neither possible nor fair. It is not possible because religious convictions have political implications. It is not fair because it requires that religious citizens translate their arguments into the secularists’ language, but not the other way around. And it is probably not even desirable because so many of our deepest convictions are embedded in religious language—even if we ourselves happen to be… ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=682))

- In American religious nationalism, apocalypticism flows together with a certain reading of the Hebrew Bible, which I will refer to as the “conquest narrative.” This narrative highlights the martial exploits of the ancient Israelites described in Joshua, Judges, and Kings. The basic formula for religious… ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=712))
- The conquest narrative can be contrasted with another reading of the Hebrew Bible that draws mainly on “Latter Prophets” such as Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. It is to this reading that I refer in using the term “prophetic religion.”16 It stresses the covenants formed between God and his people in the Pentateuch and then deepened and reaffirmed in the books of the prophets. The basic formula for civil religion in American… ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=715))
- So why does talk of blood sacrifice remain a part of Western political theology? Because the conquest narrative helps legitimate political violence, particularly violent forms of nation building. Blood helps define the nation. Shared blood (“race”) tells us who is and is not a member of the nation. Aren’t the true Israelites the blood descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?29 Aren’t they forbidden from intermarrying with other peoples? ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=756))
- Blood is also part of the act of bringing down vengeance on the unrighteous. This is where the conquest narrative flows together with apocalypticism. The crucial text is John’s Revelation, which depicts violent retribution on a cosmic scale. Following the formula of blood for blood, the avenging angels of the Lord use blood to obscure the moon and poison the waters.33 In the Pentateuch, blood is a symbol of life. In Revelation, blood becomes a symbol of death.34 ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=767))
- So blood sacrifice marks the point of divergence between prophetic religion and the conquest narrative and also the point of convergence between the conquest narrative and apocalyptic religion. It is what makes religious nationalism nationalistic: religion, people, land, and polity are all cemented together with dried blood in the form of blood sacrificed to God, blood flowing in veins, blood spilled in battle, blood showering down from heaven. Modern-day American exceptionalists may be too squeamish to speak of blood in this way. They may prefer watered-down talk about “ultimate sacrifice.” But their hands still drip with blood.

- The apocalyptic storyline is familiar. The world enters into a period of rapid moral decline. Natural disasters occur with increasing frequency and severity. These are all “signs of the times”—the “end times.” A climactic confrontation ensues between the forces of good and evil. Horrific warfare decimates the world’s population and massive conflagrations consume the earth’s surface. Finally, “like a thief in the night,” Christ swoops down from the sky, accompanied by the hosts of heaven, to defeat the forces of evil and bind the power of… ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=778))

- The apocalyptic worldview is based on a certain way of reading biblical texts, namely: (1) predictively, as an encoded message about future events that can be decoded by modern-day prophets36; (2) literally, such that the mythical creatures of the texts are understood as material realities; (3) “premillennially,” with the Second Coming of Christ understood to precede the earthly “millennium” of God’s thousand-year reign on earth; and (… ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=783))

- This is not the only way the texts can be read; nor is it even the way they have been read traditionally. The early church read them allegorically, rather than predictively.

Finally, and most fatefully, it suggests… ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=796))
- It is not hard to understand the appeal of apocalypticism: it makes us feel in the know, in the right, and in on the action. We are drawn to it for the same reasons that we are drawn to adventure and fantasy novels such as the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings series. It gives us the sense that we understand what is “really” going on, that the moral of the story is in black and white, and that we are the lead actors in the final showdown between good and evil. But apocalypticism dissolves the line between fiction and reality. And when it crosses over into politics and gains the force of arms, it can unleash forces that truly are demonic.

- If asked to characterize the political system of the United States, most of their parents would probably say that it is a “democracy” or, perhaps, a “liberal democracy.” Few Americans would even think to identify the United States as a “republic,” and those who would might not fully understand the term. As important as it was to the founders and as vital as it remained during the nineteenth century, the language of civic republicanism has been slowly supplanted by the vocabulary of liberal democracy.

- On another view, originally put forth by the British essayist Bernard Mandeville, virtue is unnecessary because free markets magically transform private vices into public goods.53 This is of course true if by “public goods” one means consumer goods, and if one cares about their production but not their distribution.

- Radical secularism combines one or more forms of radical individualism with the doctrine of total separationism.

- Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution—a Constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.

- Abraham Lincoln combed through debates surrounding the Constitution as he worked out his positions on union and abolition.

- As for the nationalist canon, it would include the writings of the anti-Federalists and of John C. Calhoun, their nineteenth-century heir. Accordingly, it might rank anti-Federalists like Patrick Henry and George Mason above proto-liberals like Jefferson and Paine, and nowadays it would put Ronald Reagan on the highest pedestal of all, well above the likes of Martin Luther King. The religious nationalist narrative is best understood as an Americanized version of the “golden age” myth.

- In France, however, republicanism and religion were soon seen as fundamentally opposed.66 Why this perception took hold there is an interesting question, but not one I can pursue here.

- On the right-hand side we find Religious Nationalism, a red-hued canvas in heavy oils, filled with the blood and fire of war and Apocalypse, and replete with battle scenes in which the forces of good and evil square off on land, on sea, and in the air.

- The rhetoric of radical secularism has also undergone a subtle shift. Early on, radical individualism was justified using arguments drawn from social Darwinism and laissez-faire economics—and in conservative libertarian circles, it still is. But among left-leaning secularists, the emphasis nowadays is on the romantic, whether in the high-minded sense of self-expression or in the carnal sense of sexual freedom (though the… ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=1074))

- Nor has the civil religious tradition been static either. Its prophetic strand has remained strong, but it has come to be flavored with less salt and more sugar.

- When modern-day religious nationalists in the United States talk about “tradition,” they imagine it as something fixed and unchanging, a pure spring that issues into a polluted river. To move away from the spring is to risk death by poisoning. This understanding of tradition is deeply indebted to a certain kind of biblical literalism—what Christian Smith refers to as “Biblicism.” ([Location 4630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4630))
- Key assumptions of biblicism include: Divine Writing. “The Bible . . . consists of . . . God’s very own words written inerrantly in human language.” Complete Coverage. “The divine will about all of the issues relevant to Christian belief and life are contained in the Bible.” Commonsense Interpretation. “Any reasonably intelligent person can read the Bible in his or her own language and correctly understand the plain meaning of the text.” Internal Harmony. “All related passages of the Bible on any given subject fit together almost like puzzle pieces into single, unified, internally consistent bodies of instruction.”1 ([Location 4633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4633))
- On this account, a pure tradition is a fixed tradition, while a dynamic tradition is a polluted one. ([Location 4639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4639))
- There is a close link between evangelical-style biblicism and Tea Party–style constitutionalism. Many evangelicals and Tea Partiers now believe that the Constitution is “divinely inspired” (a claim originally advanced only by a fringe group within the Mormon Church). Indeed, a popular painting by the “patriotic” artist Jon McNaughton depicts Jesus Christ presenting the U.S. Constitution to a transhistorical assembly that includes the founding fathers, ordinary Americans, and representatives of the various branches of the U.S. military. The practice of memorizing, citing, and carrying the text of the U.S. Constitution, which is de rigueur in Tea Party circles, simply mimics long-standing practices of Bible-toting and “proof-texting.” ([Location 4640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4640))
- Today, the most influential version of the sectarian critique can be found in the political theology of Stanley Hauerwas.18 On Hauerwas’s view, the American churches have become Troeltschian churches. They have overaccommodated themselves to the ethical and political order of the United States—so much so that they have effectively ceased being Christian churches at all but instead mainly function as cheerleading squads for American democracy. ([Location 4769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4769))
- As if this weren’t bad enough, Hauerwas adds, American democracy is hardly worth cheering for. The American state is a state just like any other, he argues, with an inherent and ineluctable tendency to expand into and encroach upon all aspects of life, not least the life of the churches. Indeed, from a Christian perspective, as Hauerwas wrote in the mid-1980s, there is really no meaningful difference between liberal democracy and communist totalitarianism, since “democracies . . . can be just as tyrannical in their claims on the loyalties of their citizens as totalitarian alternatives.” ([Location 4773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4773))
- because democratic and totalitarian regimes both spring from the same root: “The modern bureaucratic states, American and Soviet, are both creatures . . . of liberalism.”21 The only real difference between such regimes, Hauerwas continues, is that liberal forms of oppression are more subtle and sinister than totalitarian ones. For example, freedom of religion “has tempted Christians in America to think that democracy is fundamentally neutral and, perhaps, even friendly toward… ([Location 4779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4779))
- At the end of the day, Hauerwas concludes, Christians are but “resident aliens” in whatever polity they inhabit, and Christian theology provides no grounds for preferring one sort of polity to another—constitutional democracy to communist totalitarianism, say.24 On this question, he argues, the scriptures are silent. He thus urges American Christians to stop putting so much faith in the possibilities of politics. Indeed, they should even stop worrying so much about the future… ([Location 4785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4785))
- What does Hauerwas recommend the churches do? In essence, they should become Christian churches again. Specifically, they should (1) stop trying to influence the American polity and become their own polities because the church is the only “true polity” the Christian “will know in this life”25; and (2) stop trying to translate their message into a public language, as the “church’s social task is first of all its willingness to be a community formed by a language the world does not share.”26 In short, when Hauerwas says that “the church should be the church”—and he says this often; it is perhaps his most famous… ([Location 4791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=4791))
- now want to consider two rational and reasonable positions that are closely related to the civil religious tradition: “constitutional patriotism” (as described by Habermas) and “liberal nationalism” (as described by Tamir and Kymlicka). Both wrestle with the same question that I am trying to address: What sort of loyalty can, and must, a democratic polity reasonably expect of its citizens today, given the increasing cultural diversity that has resulted from immigration, secularization, and, indeed, democratic freedom itself?

- Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be. . . .   O, let America be America again— The land that never has been yet— And yet must be . . . America never was America to me, And yet I swear this oath— America will be! . . .  —LANGSTON HUGHES ([Location 5060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5060))
- IN ORDER FOR America to be America again, said Langston Hughes, Americans must do four things. They must remember the dream that used to be—and remember it rightly. They must understand that the dream has never been fully realized—and never can be. They must acknowledge that many have been excluded from that dream—and still are. And they must try to redeem the dream for themselves and their posterity—knowing full well that they are ultimately destined to fail. About all this, Hughes was right. ([Location 5067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5067))
- That dream was never fully realized—not by the Puritans, not by the revolutionaries, not during Reconstruction, and not by later generations. Nor will it ever be, by this generation, the next, or any other, because the American republic is built with the crooked timber of a fallen humanity, just like any other polity. Still, each generation of Americans is… ([Location 5072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5072))
- The dream of the righteous republic is the dream of a free people governing themselves for the common good. The Puritans imagined it as a city upon a hill knit together by Christian charity.

Addams dreamed that democracy would pervade the American way of life. King’s preferred metaphor was… ([Location 5076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5076))

- The prophetic ethic of righteousness is a social as well as an individual ethic. It demands that the political community protect the weak and downtrodden from the high and mighty. The prophetic ethic is also an egalitarian ethic. It insists that there are no gods among us, nothing human or material that deserves our worship; all are equal before God and one another. At the core of prophetic religion, then, is an ethic of… ([Location 5082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5082))
- A righteous republic is also based on a certain vision of the political community—and again, not just any vision, but one rooted in the republican tradition, rather than its liberal rival. What is the difference between the two? The republican tradition is both more realistic and more idealistic: more realistic because it regards liberal institutions (e.g., rights, elections, and checks and balances) as necessary but insufficient safeguards of the common good and balance between social groups as crucial, and more idealistic insofar as it regards civic… ([Location 5086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5086))
- Today, too many Americans misunderstand the righteousness of the righteous republic. Some understand it too narrowly, as individual righteousness, or… ([Location 5092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5092))
- Many Americans also confuse righteousness with self-righteousness. To be sure, the prophetic ethic is not an anything-goes ethic; it is not based on moral relativism. With King, it presumes that there are laws of justice that are every bit as real and universal as the laws of physics. But it does not pretend to have perfect knowledge of those laws, much less to perfectly embody them… ([Location 5097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5097))

- The Declaration and the Constitution both speak of other values besides freedom. Equality is especially prominent in the nation’s values because of its place in the preamble and in the nation’s history. Also important are national solidarity (“We, the People, in order to form a more perfect union”), the common good (or “general welfare”), and active citizenship (“the pursuit of happiness” in the sense of “… ([Location 5102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5102))
- Too, many Americans misunderstand the kind of freedom that a republic promises—and demands. They conceive of it too narrowly as mere absence of restraint or, more narrowly still, as the absence of governmental restraint. This is a liberal or libertarian vision of freedom, not a republican one. As such, it is a very grave misunderstanding… ([Location 5106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5106))

- Republican freedom also means being the master of one’s passions. People who cannot order and govern their own desires are not in control of themselves. They are dominated—tyrannized—by their own passions. Republican freedom also… ([Location 5111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5111))
- The republican understanding of freedom is also more realistic than the liberal one. For the liberal, deliberation and choice are everything. But being free to swim involves more than being allowed to jump in the water. To equate the two is to confuse swimming with drowning. ([Location 5115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5115))
- Swimming requires lessons and practice. The same logic applies to the core freedoms of the liberal tradition. How much freedom of expression do I really have if I am illiterate, or if I have no access to books or the Internet? Freedom requires skill, not just will. And a free society is one that affords its citizens opportunities and resources to discover and develop their talents. ([Location 5117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07M8DSSJP&location=5117))
- We are not “born free”; rather, we become free. We do so by becoming masters of ourselves and becoming active citizens. We are only “born free” in the sense that we may be born into a free society that affords us the opportunity to attain freedom. And that is a matter of good fortune rather than moral virtue. In sum, true freedom involves more than “being left alone” and “doing what I want.” That is not freedom; it is idiocy.
