- Roughly speaking, “white Christian nationalism” (WCN) is the view that America was built by and for white Christians, and that if you are not a white Christian, you are also not fully or truly American. In the bluntest terms, real Americans are white Christians and vice versa. ([Location 2208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086MCJ6KW&location=2208))
