- It might be said about dominant policy paradigms like neoliberalism that it can be difficult to think about them when it has become so commonplace to think with them. ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=61))
- Constructions of Neoliberal Reason proposes a fresh way of looking at the free-market revolution, asking where it came from and where it continues to come from. It does so by bringing neoliberalism to earth, countering the (prevalent) understanding of neoliberalism as a shorthand term for the ideological atmosphere. Instead, a sustained focus is placed on some of the diverse ways that the project has been made and remade, through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, in ideational, ideological, and institutional terms. This means tracking the project’s uneven and uncertain progress, from its inauspicious beginnings as a reactionary cult, through its moments of vanguardist advance, to its effective mainstreaming as a restructuring ethos and as an adaptive form of regulatory practice. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=64))
- Neither does it invoke neoliberal-ism as a summary label, to be applied to particular politicians, policy techniques, or parts of the world. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=72))

- out-of-character moments and more banal manifestations. It sets out to denaturalize neoliberalism by calling attention to its socially produced form, tracking the project to some of its “natural” settings but also into sites where it is “out of place.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=76))
- If neoliberalization were simply a matter of imposing a Hayekian blue‐print, or stepping back to enable markets to work their magic, there would be no need for a book like this. Far from being predestined, the free-market revolution looks in retrospect to have been a rather improbable achievement. Its pioneers were initially guided only by their shared distaste for what they saw as the totalizing tendencies of the Leviathan state. This was associated with a near-paranoid worldview: the wide-eyed advocates of the market often had an almost phobic reaction to the state and statism. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=84))
- As Alvin Hansen wrote in his rebuttal of Friedrich von Hayek’s Road to Serfdom, one of the movement’s foundational scripts, in 1945, “This… is not scholarship. It is seeing hobgoblins under every bed.” ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=88))

- Once neoliberals themselves had their hands on the levers of power, so they were to find—repeatedly—that markets would fail, that bubbles would burst, that deregulation would descend into overreach, that privatization would make monopolies.

- If there is an enduring logic to neoliberalization, it does not follow the pristine path of rolling market liberalization and competitive convergence; it is one of repeated, prosaic, and often botched efforts to fix markets, to build quasi-markets, and to repair market failures. Neoliberalization, in this sense, is not the antithesis of regulation, it is a self-contradictory form of regulation-in-denial. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=98))

- The process of constructing neoliberalism has been a continuous one. So the neoliberal idea, its conceptual moment, did not “come first”—to be followed by a series of translations, all the way down to the prosaic practices and mundane manifestations of market governance “on the ground.” The ideational, ideological, and institutional moments of neoliberalization have always been mixed up, mutually constituted. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=106))
- What follows is a non-reductionist reading of neoliberalization, which takes due account of (but tries not to get lost in) the project’s sociological complexity. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=119))
- For a quarter-century, certain free-market doctrines have prevailed: Free and unfettered markets are efficient; if they make mistakes, they quickly correct them. The best government is a small government, and regulation only impedes innovation […] ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=164))

And this uneven and uncertain terrain across which the project of neoliberalism has been projected, prosecuted, and peripatetically recon-structed.

- The following chapters could never constitute a compre-hensive historical geography of neoliberalism. Instead they are offered as explorations of a series of vectors, moments, and oscillations in the protracted process of neoliberalization, arranged in a loose historical sequence from the early twentieth century to the first decade of the twenty-first, more of less from Ordoliberalism in interwar Germany to Obamanomics in the contemporary United States. The focus is on generative sites and moments of neoliberalization, mainly located in the global North. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=181))
    - **Note:** This is a good exemplar of qualifying remarks needed for my treatment of nationalisms.
- a provisional definition of neoliberalism, the meaning of which tends not only to be in the eye of the beholder, but also to vary with the location of the beholder. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=191))
- For all their performative display of liberal cultural innovation, creativity strategies barely disrupt now-extant urban-policy orthodoxies, based on interlocal competition, place marketing, property-and market-led development, gentrification, and normalized sociospatial inequality. But more than this, creativity discourses provide an entree into some of the (imagined and real) everyday spaces of neoliberalization. The much-celebrated hipster subjects of the creative class are not only self-absorbed but self-managing individuals, trading on innate talent in a world of cosmopolitan competitiveness. A far cry from the tweedy intellectuals who met at Mont Pelerin, they are new-age neoliberals, dressed in black. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=213))
- With increasing intensity over the last decade, many of us have been grappling with the meaning and consequences of “neoliberalism,” such that elements of a shared (critical) understanding can often be found between texts as well as within them. Although I must accept the ultimate responsibility for the limits of the analysis presented here, it has benefited enormously from the collaborative efforts, constructive advice, and corrective interventions of a great many fellow travelers and occasional interlocutors.

- Many would also loosely equate neoliberalism with “Americanization,” though the term is scarcely recognized in the United States, in part due to long-established associations between the word “liberal” and left-interventionism.

- Its out-there meaning is as a byword for a distinctly American form of deregulated capitalism, most often portrayed as an off-shore threat to European traditions of social solidarity and the accompanying “social model” of organized capitalism. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=293))
- though most Europeans would point West when asked to identify the origins of neoliberalism—identifying London, Washington, DC, and Chicago, in particular as germinal sites of the free-market project, and the United States as the locus of deregulated capitalism—most would also acknowledge that there are now distinctively European strains of the virus too. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=303))
- [I]n place of the nineteenth century understanding that laissez-faire is the means to achieve [the goal of individual freedom], neoliberalism proposes that it is competition that will lead the way … The state will police the system, it will establish the conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, it will provide a stable monetary framework, and relieve acute poverty and distress. Citizens will be protected against the state, since there exists a free private market, and the competition will protect them from one another.

- Notwithstanding its trademark antistatist rhetoric, neoliberalism was always concerned—at its philosophical, political, and practical core—with the challenge of first seizing and then retasking the state. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=335))

- Stagflation broke the back of the Keynesian orthodoxy—as both a generative theory and as a system of government—the long-anticipated crisis for which Friedman’s style of monetarist economics provided readily presentable, if ultimately flawed, “solutions.” ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=360))
- The demonstrated reach and penetration of Chicago School networks—the subject of meticulous empirical investigation, and so no longer the preserve of conspiracy theorists—is such as to confer at least a degree of credibility on centrifugal theories of the diffusion of neoliberalism.

- Neoliberalism, it will be argued here, has only ever existed in “impure” form, indeed can only exist in messy hybrids. Its utopian vision of a free society and free economy is ultimately unrealizable. Yet the pristine clarity of its ideological apparition, the free market, coupled with the endless frustrations borne of the inevitable failure to arrive at this elusive destination, nevertheless confer a significant degree of forward momentum on the neoliberal project.

- Neoliberalism’s burden—as a resilient, responsive and deeply reactionary credo—is that it can never remake the world in its own image.

- The sound bite version was that regulation, intervention, and the state were now back, and therefore that the “era” of neoliberalism, which began with the joint ascendancy of Thatcher and Reagan, was officially over. Political elites, everywhere from Japan to Australia, and France to Iceland, were busily declaring that the infatuation with market fundamentalism had passed.16 These claims found a willing echo on parts of the left, not least because they appeared to ratify the long-held (but often rescheduled) belief that neoliberalism was always destined to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=426))
- Neoliberalism, in its various guises, has always been about the capture and reuse of the state, in the interests of shaping a pro-corporate, freer-trading “market order,” even though this has never been a process of cookie-cutter replication of an unproblematic strategy.

- neoliberalization refers to a quali-tatively differentiated process, rather than to a developmental stage or quantitative threshold; it denotes the form of state/economy relations, not a linear path towards a purely free-market state.

- For example, the unsustainable reliance on debt and credit in the American form of deeply financialized neoliberalism, in the decade before the crash of 2008, was clearly predicated not only on a particular configuration of international economic and geopolitical relations, it also actively enabled a distinctive path of neoliberal development in China, such that the American and Chinese forms of neoliberalization were effectively coproduced.31 They were not (indeed could not have been) free-standing “models.” ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=463))

- In their content analysis of the term neoliberalism in the political-science literature, for example, Boas and Gans-Morse find it to be almost indiscriminately applied to a wide range of phenomena by critics, while being virtually absent, if not a taboo word, amongst advocates of market reform. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=511))
- Before long, the term had escaped from its original meaning of a list of 10 specific reforms that most influential people in a certain city agreed would be good for a specific region of the world at a certain date in history, to mean an ideological agenda valid for all time that was supposedly being imposed on all countries.

- The apparent toxicity of neoliberalism as a signifier amongst mainstream politicians and policy reformers, who will often only be caught using the word when somehow distancing themselves from it, stands in stark contrast, then, to the term’s accelerating circulation in the critical social sciences. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=530))
- neoliberalism seems often to be used as a sort of stand-in term for the political-economic zeitgeist, as a no-more-than approximate proxy for a specific analysis of mechanisms or relations of social power, domination, exploitation, or alienation. The forms and registers of the phenomenon can seem almost without ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=534))
- reason. It has been argued here that, for all its doctrinal certainty, the neoliberal project is paradoxically defined by the very unattainability of its fundamental goal—frictionless market rule. Rather than the goal itself, it is the oscillations and vacillations around frustrated attempts to reach it that shape the revealed form of neoliberalism as a contradictory mode of market governance. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=558))
- In essence, the position that they developed was that most of the contemporaneous alternatives, while they have may looked quite distinctive from one another, would in fact all lead down the same “road to serfdom,” to use Hayek’s provocative term.

- The real [choice] was between a liberal politics and any other form whatsoever of economic interventionism, whether this takes the mild form of Keynesianism or the drastic form of an autarchic plan like that of Germany. So we have an invariant that could be called … the anti-liberal invariant, which possesses its own logic and internal necessity. This is what the ordoliberals deciphered in the experience of Nazism. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=576))
- the Ordoliberals were relatively moderate and pragmatic, espousing a humanist form of market economics. This was rooted in the understanding that the full capacities of markets could only be realized through their embedding in a robust legal and social order, including preemptive, “market conforming” interventions on the part of the state. The foil for these arguments, which defined the Ordo group as neoliberals, was provided by the demonstrable limits of nineteenth-century laissez-faire, Austrianism, and Manchesterism, against which the Ordoliberals maintained a critical, if not antagonistic, relationship. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=584))
- Chicagoans, in contrast, retained a more idealistic affinity to their nineteenth-century predecessors, while developing a position that endowed the market with vigorously autonomous capacities. In its earlier manifestations, through the work of Henry Simons,46 the proto-Chicago School had acknowledged a range of “positive” functions for the state, but under the more partisan leadership of Milton Friedman, after 1946, the Chicago line would become doctrinally anti-state. It was this position that Foucault later characterized as “anarcho-liberalism,” and which leading Ordoliberals had previously portrayed as “liberal anarchism” or paleoliberalism.

- For this reason, moreover, processual definitions of neoliberalization are preferable to static and taxonomic renderings of neoliberalism, since the latter tend to rely too heavily on regime-like conceptions, bracketed in time and space.

- In the most abstract of terms, one can say that neoliberalization refers to a contradictory process of market-like rule, principally negotiated at the boundaries of the state, and occupying the ideological space defined by a (broadly) sympathetic critique of nineteenth-century laissez-faire and deep antipathies to collectivist, planned, and socialized modes of government, especially those associated with Keynesianism and developmentalism.

- neoliberals have never been able to live with, or without, the state. They are repeatedly drawn to rhetorical denigrations of the state, yet they literally do not know where to stop.

- By way of illustration, examples of these roll-back/roll-out dialectics in particular policy fields have included: labor-market flexibility and deregulation policies, coupled with welfare cutbacks, leading to the downstream imperative to develop “in work” support systems for the working poor; privatization of public utilities, like water and communications, leading to a need to extend regulatory oversight, in the face of system failures, private monopoly abuses, and legitimacy problems; social-service cutbacks in fields such as public housing and subsidized food being partially backfilled through new non-entitlement services, delivered by nonprofit or private providers; overreach in trade liberalization or financial deregulation, in cases of marked economic dislocation or market failure, being followed by exceptions-to-the-rule “deals” and reregulatory “corrections.” ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=715))
- These are, simultaneously, examples of neoliberal policy failure and neoliberal policy adaption, again underlining the sense in which neoliberal restructuring resembles not so much a triumphal, forward march as a series of prosaic “forward failures.” ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=721))
- Roll-out neoliberalization, then, represents more than an attempt to remake the world in the image of markets, most actually existing alternatives having been weakened.

- battles not fought.

- Humanity’s historic encounter with laissez-faire had reaped its devastating consequences; the fiction of the self-regulating market, foisted on the world as if it represented some kind of natural order, had been exposed in the starkly utopian form of world war and financial crisis. “Freedom’s utter frustration in fascism” was, Polanyi believed, the “inevitable result” of nineteenth-century liberalism’s antisocial vision.6 The “market mentality,” Polanyi later concluded, had been rendered “obsolete” by these historical developments.

- Recognition of the necessity for extra-economic, indeed moral, regulation was therefore a defining characteristic of German neoliberalism, animated as it was by an idealized vision of a decentralized, but orderly, society—an unapologetically bourgeois order. Many of the contemporary threats to this order came from excessive concentration, in all its forms—private monopolies, sprawling cities, multilateral policymaking.

- In some respects, the market-first model of Chicago School neoliberalism found its mirror-image in the state-first model of Ordoliberalism. Foucault went as far as to characterize them as “completely contrary” intellectual and political movements. These are better understood as countercurrents within an enfolding ideological dynamic of neoliberalism, which Hayek and the MPS placed in (mostly) productive tension.

- While the ascendant Chicago School may have represented the most precocious strand/brand of neoliberalism, it never stood for the singular essence of the project. Rather, it established a key coordinate in the discursive space staked out by the Mont Pelerinians. Ordoliberalism defined another, though in retrospect its moment of realization as an actually-existing neoliberalism may have come too soon. Erhard himself was pressured to dabble with Keynesian measures in the mid-1960s, a prelude to the Social Democratic makeover of the social-market economy later in the decade.149 Hayek would claim to have foreseen this slippery slope, ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=1752))
- By the time of the 1972 MPS meeting in Montreaux, Milton Friedman was arguing that the war of ideas within economics had now been won, and that it was time to consider dissolving the Society.151 This proposal was defeated; there was still work for the Mont Pelerinians to do. And it was now time to press home the advantage. The economic dislocations of the 1970s created an environment in which neoliberal nostrums finally acquired real traction, then Thatcher and Reagan would both rise to power on the basis of economic advice delivered, quite disproportionately, by Mont Pelerinians.152 Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one of Friedman’s successors as MPS president, James Buchanan, was busy warning that, as socialism lay dead, the Leviathan-state continued to threaten. There was, he sensed, a pervasive “attitude of nihilism” around the question of eco-nomic organization: while the fallibility of command economics had been vividly demonstrated, there remained a “residual unwillingness” to defer to the free market, governed by the rule of law: ([Location 1760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=1760))

- Into this fray stepped the first president of the University of Chicago, William Rainey Harper, whose aggressive hiring policy was already fueling a climate of resentment and suspicion around what critics liked to call Standard Oil University. Determined to build his new university on a “grand scale,” Harper recruited research stars from the Ivy League, paying high salaries but requiring them to live “the life of frontiersmen… isolated from the rest of the country in a venture which had no past.”26 This was a “new university located on the outskirts of a new city,” which to some seemed to embody “all the tensions, uncertainties, and hopes of America in the new century.”27 The formation of the University of Chicago as a private institution in a “new” city represented what Friedman later characterized as a “tabular rasa [since there was] no dead wood to be eliminated, no vested interests to be rooted out.”28 Moreover, in contrast to the great public universities of the Midwest, it was free from the “inevitable entanglements with state government.”29 As a result, Chicago became a place of robust intellectual independence, never “trucking in vulgar opinion,” and riding out the political storms of the first half of the twentieth century as if securely moored in a “sheltered inland sea.”30 ([Location 2252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2252))

- By the time that Hayek arrived in Chicago for a sabbatical in the spring of 1946, it was clear that something was afoot. Simons had been maneuvering to construct a “project” around Hayek for some time, including a planned “raid” on Minnesota, for Stigler and Friedman. Simons was dead by the summer of 1946, but his plan was in motion. Before the year’s end, the “Knight affinity group” had been reassembled in Chicago, consisting of Friedman in Economics, Allen Wallis in the Graduate School of Business, and Aaron Director in the Law School—now as Simons’ replacement. Securing Hayek and Stigler would take several more years. ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2375))
- The Cold War was nothing if not a war of competing economic ideologies, with profound implications for the (re)constitution and dominant trajectory of American economics.70 And although leading members of the Cowles Commission were to remain ambivalent about Keynes and Keynesian macroeconomics during the Chicago years, their preferred forms of general equilibrium modeling would later be associated with the formalization of a distinctly American version of the “Keynesian synthesis.” ([Location 2431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2431))

([Location 2460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2460))
- An increasingly politicized Milton Friedman was now sensing that the ideological trend towards collectivism might be maxing out, and that the time was ripe to begin to “promote the ideas that can guide the next generation of legislators.” In one of his rare uses of the word, he explained in 1951 that the “doctrine [of] neoliberalism… that, in America in particular, is connected to the name Henry Simons [seems to have been] created to fill the void.” ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2477))
- Somewhat ironically, Friedman was soon arguing—in his influential essay on methodology, published in 1953—for a strict separation of positive (“what is”) and normative (“what ought to be”) modalities of economic discourse. His concern was to elaborate a methodology of “positive economics,” judged according to its predictive power (rather than the “realism” of its assumptions) and “in principle independent of any particular ethical position or normative judgments.” ([Location 2482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2482))

In policy terms, this was translated into advocacy for decentralized and privatized strategies—a sort of dynamic, competitive federalism, galvanized by a determination to disperse power away from established centers like New York City and Washington, DC.

- In one of the most storied episodes in the history of neoliberalism, Pinochet effectively handed control of economic policy over to “Los Chee-Ca-Go Boys,” as they became known—a group of Chicago-trained economists, led by de Castro, who would staff the key positions in his administration.145 In this notorious application of “shock treatment,” the Chicago Boys went to war against inflation, which had spiked at 370 percent in the first year of the junta, their actions driving the economy immediately into recession, while at the same time setting about an uninhibited program of trade liberalization, tax reform, privatization, deregulation of foreign investment flows, and monetary restraint. An early move was to invite two of their Chicago professors, Arnold Harberger and Milton Friedman, for a week of seminars, public lectures, and meetings with military managers, culminating in an audience with Pinochet—all designed to bolster the credibility of the reform program. Not surprisingly, Harberger and Friedman signed off on the plan, which they might have authored by proxy. ([Location 2741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2741))
- President’s Economic Advisory Board, which also included Alan Greenspan, Arthur Laffer, and William Simon—a cabal that he portrayed as “independent thinkers” with a “free-market orientation,” and all professional economists rather than “‘yes’ persons.”170 Of the twelve members of Reagan’s economic “brains trust,” fully half had substantial Chicago connections.

- But when reporters invited Stigler to comment on Reagan’s economic program, he curtly dismissed supply-side economics as “a gimmick [if not] a slogan… Where they went too far was in claiming so much for it and saying that if we do that, that alone will take care of inflation and things like that. I don’t think that was in the cards.”175 When Stigler went on to use the word “depression,” he was practically bundled from the platform, “in a manner reminiscent of vaudeville days.”176 The liberal use of what Stigler rather proudly described as his “unruly tongue” had apparently confirmed, for both sides, the Chicagoan’s long-held view that politicians and economists were breeds apart.

- His work on the microeconomics of regulation, in particular, had extended the rational-choice paradigm deep into the sphere of politics itself, yielding the conclusion that policymakers should be seen as “endogenous participants in a political-economic process,” whose preoccupations with the calculus of utilitarian and electoral gain rendered them, in the words of Melvin Reder, “incapable of acting on advice as to the promotion of general welfare, and unlikely to be much interested in receiving such advice.” ([Location 2849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2849))

- if “the vitality of [the Chicago] tradition is threatened,” it was, ironically, more a product of “the growing acceptance of many of its key ideas than [due to] resistance to them”; what was once a highly distinctive Chicago emphasis on competition and the money supply having “become mainstream economics.” ([Location 2915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=2915))
- In retrospect, the moment of Reaganomics represented a crossroads—and the first of many, rather than some final “destination”—in the Chicago School’s long trek from local epistemology to elite consensus, if not common sense.

- The influence of the Chicago School was to rise in lockstep with the misery index—a simple measure of the late-Keynesian ordeal of unemployment plus inflation—the historic peak of which coincided, exactly, with the presidential election of 1980. And it is no coincidence that this moment of macroeconomic rupture also represented the moment of rapture for the Chicago brand of crisis theory. Friedman’s infamous concession that only crises produce “real change,” was rooted in the pragmatic understanding that tectonic shifts in the climate of opinion are wrought by “experience, not by theory or philosophy.” ([Location 3054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005QMJ2JC&location=3054))
- Charting some of the traces in this long transformation, the chapter examines the far-reaching ways in which American’s urban condition has been successively reimagined by the ideational activists and policy retailers of the right—those “organic intellectuals” in the think tanks. These efforts, it will be argued, have helped facilitate a transformative rethinking of the city, both as an object and a subject of regulation.
