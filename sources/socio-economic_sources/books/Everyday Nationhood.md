### Highlights

- “Nationalism gives shape to soccer loyalties and the Olympic games, as well as to wars and economic competition (Billig 1995).” ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=433))
- Billig in a sense opened the eyes of researchers to the omnipresence of nationalism and the question of when, in his words, it is flagged and unflagged. The last was a pun, of course, because national flags themselves could appear in flagged and unflagged ways. They could be a casual background in everyday transactions and fields of vision, or the focus of patriotic attention in ceremonies—or indeed military mobilizations. One of Billig’s key points was that, at least in “established nations” it was possible much of the time to forget the very remembering and reproduction of nationalism embedded in everyday representations (Billig 1995: 38). In other words, it is not just that we forget acts of violence that shaped our collective past as Renan famously observed (1990); we fail to see many of the ways in which we are led to remember to think of ourselves as nationals.

- As Billig himself put it in the opening of the Conclusion to Banal Nationalism, “This book has been urging again and again: ‘Look and see the constant flaggings of nationhood’” (Billig 1995: 74). ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=445))
- We notice violent nationalist mobilizations and extreme nationalist politics but fail to spot the pervasive appearance of national symbols and the constant location of “the” nation as “our” location in the world. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=448))
- He emphasized, thus, the role of “little words” like the definite article “the” which helps reproduce the notion of bounded, discrete nations even when deployed in seemingly apolitical popular culture and media reports. To say, “the nation was shocked”, does this work whether the shock involves a football loss or the disappearance of an airplane from distant skies. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=451))
- Though language was Billig’s special interest, researchers in recent years have paid more and more attention to visual representation. This includes symbolism and iconography, but also as with language there are constant apparently less loaded representations, like maps and the organization of museum galleries as presenting French or Italian artists. And of course there are flags: actual, literal flags. Scotland’s Saltire and England’s Cross of St. George evoke nations—and also stances toward nations. At the time of this writing, they also evoke a crisis of British solidarity. The flagging is seldom if ever entirely neutral. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=455))
- Nationalism is available for political purposes and dramatic moments of mobilization only because it is produced and reproduced in banal and everyday forms. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=463))
- Throughout the literature on nationalism, and even more in the press and popular accounts, there remains a bias toward seeing nationalism in a mixture of instrumentally pursued agendas and potentially bloody political passions. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=477))
- he addresses very helpfully the characteristic forgetting and even denial that allows people in the West and especially perhaps in the US to think they have no nationalism, but only patriotism or calm and sensible civic feeling. Nationalism is seen mainly in other places and in extremists. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=481))
- They are made possible by the constant reproduction of a sense of national belonging in everyday language use, media, and even sports. This generates and reproduces an “us” identity in the sense of Billig’s teacher Henri Tajfel, one about which we are both prideful and defensive. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=484))
- One concerns the elision between “nation” and “society” in much discussion. Billig points in particular to the prominence of this in much American sociology (he has Parsons especially in mind). There it reflects the particular penchant to forgetting nationalism that is connected to hegemonic power and a tendency to elide the idea of national and universal interests (Billig 1995: 98). But it is clearly a broader phenomenon than this. And while he wants to point out that it influences academic sociology, he also sees it as part of the more general forgetting of everyday nationalism. He doesn’t offer a sustained critique of the society/nation elision, though one can imagine that had he written one it would be similar to his critical analysis of the implicit nationalism of Richard Rorty’s philosophy. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=492))
- the very modern idea of societies as implicitly discrete and bounded units owes much to nationalism. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, the two ideas grew up together each informing the other (Calhoun 1999). ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=500))
- I think the argument would be stronger if Billig relied less on the notion of “ideology ” to categorize nationalism. In the first place, this very easily locates it in the realm of politics and actually obscures the banal forms of its reproduction that Billig emphasizes. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=511))
- I would prefer to call the national or nationalist imaginary. I think it is important to see nationalism not just as an ideology that happens to be implicit in Parsons or any other sociologist, but as a social imaginary that informs much more generally the way in which academics and others understand the idea and existence of nations. The nationalist imaginary is not simply an error by analysts, but an active part of the reproduction of a world organized in terms of nations. Analysts may participate in this uncritically or be more reflexively aware of it (Calhoun 2002, 2007a). ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=520))
- Benedict Anderson famously suggested that nationalism was not so much one modern political ideology , like liberalism or communism, as it was a pervasive way of imagining the world—more like religion and kinship. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=526))
- Billig seems to think that reference to imagining is inherently subjective and obscures the recurrent formal aspects of nationalism. But this implies an unfortunate dualism, as for example he claims that “national identities are forms of social life, rather than internal psychological states” (1995: 24). He is right to emphasize social forms, but surely this is a false opposition. The idea of social imaginaries is precisely a bridge between the objectively recurrent and the subjectively enacted. It is because we have a social imaginary of the market or voting, to follow Charles Taylor (2004), that we are able both to take a variety of actions, indeed interactions, and understand ourselves and others as we do so. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=534))
- everyday nationalism consists not just of a bunch of words that happen to be repeated, but participates in grammar and syntax that make it hard to speak without reproducing national thinking. Billig makes clear that this is a matter of visual imagery as well as words, but it is also a matter of action, of phenomenologically inhabiting the world, not only of engaging with representations. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=542))
- In the 1991 revised edition of Imagined Communities , Anderson added a brilliant chapter on “census, map, and museum” as vehicles for imagining nations. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=550))
- More deeply, social imaginaries are crucial to the process of the production and reproduction of social reality. They are not merely subjective, but evidence of the speciousness of the sharp opposition between subjective and objective. They are ways in which some very firm and even in certain senses material realities come into being and continue to influence our lives. Corporations are creatures of social imagination; so are nations. I have addressed this elsewhere and won’t elaborate or fully develop the point here (Calhoun et al. 2015). But it speaks to everyday nationalism because this is not merely a set of “flat” contents on the surface of social life, but part of the process of social imagination that makes national thinking and national sense of belonging available for politics. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=554))
- Billig twice quotes Shotter (1991) to the effect that nationalism is commonly a “tradition of argumentation.” The nation is reproduced as a common reference point in debates over what the nation should be, how it should be defended, or its interests advanced. For this reason, a vital, agonistic public sphere may be a feature of thriving national solidarity not its enemy. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=565))
- To think that nationalism is always bad, and that banal nationalism simply underwrites the always available potential for more evil, obscures the importance of nationalism to some much more positive projects. I don’t just mean that in times of war soldiers and indeed ordinary people may feel a sense of solidarity and that this is good. More basically, I mean that nationalism is integral to much of modern democracy. Nationalist discourse is integral to constructions of “we the people” (Smith 2003). A sense of common national membership is integral to acceptances of different opinions and even electoral losses. And beyond democracy, a sense of belonging to a common nation has underwritten many modern projects of economic redistribution and social welfare. The National Health Service has its name for a reason. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=576))
- My point is not that these good institutions justify the evil actions undertaken in the name of nations. It is, rather, that a very significant part of how nationalism is reproduced is through its embedding in collective projects of national improvement. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077JPLL67&location=583))
- Forgetting the international character of nationalism is conducive to illusory notions of how globalization will affect nationalism. It never ceases to amaze me how many people have imagined that globalization will simply replace nationalism with a universal, cosmopolitan consciousness. Billig points out reasons why this is a fantasy, even though globalization does pose challenges to national states. I would go further arguing that nationalism, including reactive, defensive, and belligerent nationalism, is among the ways people respond to globalization (Calhoun 2007). Nations are not merely valued goods people defend against global challenges; they are resources people mobilize and augment to cope with global challenges. This extends to the solidarities maintained in diasporas and not only solidarity against migrants but the projects of assimilation by which migrants are integrated into host nations which are not only enriched, but actually become more articulate about themselves in the process.
