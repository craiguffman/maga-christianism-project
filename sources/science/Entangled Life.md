### Highlights

- These fungi weave themselves through the gaps between plant cells in an intimate brocade and help to defend plants against disease. No plant grown under natural conditions has been found without these fungi; they are as much a part of planthood as leaves or roots. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=141))
- Fungi are metabolic wizards and can explore, scavenge, and salvage ingeniously, their abilities rivaled only by bacteria. Using cocktails of potent enzymes and acids, fungi can break down some of the most stubborn substances on the planet, from lignin, wood’s toughest component, to rock; crude oil; polyurethane plastics; and the explosive TNT. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=145))
- mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of fungi, the place where spores are produced. Fungi use spores like plants use seeds: to disperse themselves. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=153))
- Fungi produce around fifty megatons of spores each year—equivalent to the weight of five hundred thousand blue whales—making them the largest source of living particles in the air. Spores are found in clouds and influence the weather by triggering the formation of the water droplets that form rain and the ice crystals that form snow, sleet, and hail. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=160))
- most fungi form networks of many cells known as hyphae (pronounced HY fee): fine tubular structures that branch, fuse, and tangle into the anarchic filigree of mycelium. Mycelium describes the most common of fungal habits, better thought of not as a thing but as a process: an exploratory, irregular tendency. Water and nutrients flow through ecosystems within mycelial networks. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=166))
- After humans, the animals that form some of the largest and most complex societies on Earth are leaf-cutter ants. Colonies can reach sizes of more than eight million individuals, with underground nests that grow larger than thirty meters across. The lives of leaf-cutter ants revolve around a fungus that they cultivate in cavernous chambers and feed with fragments of leaf. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=182))
- Although fungi have long been lumped together with plants, they are actually more closely related to animals—an example of the kind of category mistake that researchers regularly make in their struggle to understand fungal lives. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=209))
- fraction of the attention given to animals and plants. The best estimate suggests that there are between 2.2 and 3.8 million species of fungi in the world—six to ten times the estimated number of plant species—meaning that a mere six percent of all fungal species have been described. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=227))
- fascinated by fungi and the transformations they provoke. A solid log becomes soil, a lump of dough rises into bread, a mushroom erupts overnight—but how? ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=231))
- of life turned out to be full of intimate collaborations. Most plants, I learned, depend on fungi to provide them with nutrients from the soil, such as phosphorus or nitrogen, in exchange for energy-giving sugars and lipids produced in photosynthesis—the process by which plants eat light and carbon dioxide from the air. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=237))
- Plants and mycorrhizal fungi are promiscuous: many fungi can live within the roots of a single plant, and many plants can connect with a single fungal network. In this way a variety of substances, from nutrients to signaling compounds, can pass between plants via fungal connections. In simple terms, plants are socially networked by fungi. This is what is meant by the “wood wide web.” ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=260))
- WHETHER IN FORESTS, labs, or kitchens, fungi have changed my understanding of how life happens. These organisms make questions of our categories, and thinking about them makes the world look different. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=288))
- Agoraphobia can set in. It’s tempting to hide in small rooms built from quick answers. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=291))

- Our perceptions work in large part by expectation. It takes less cognitive effort to make sense of the world using preconceived images updated with a small amount of new sensory information than to constantly form entirely new perceptions from scratch. It is our preconceptions that create the blind spots in which magicians do their work. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=299))

- Tricked out of our expectations, we fall back on our senses. What’s astonishing is the gulf between what we expect to find and what we find when we actually look. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=304))

- The first is a growing awareness of the many sophisticated, problem-solving behaviors that have evolved in brainless organisms outside the animal kingdom. The best-known examples are slime molds, such as Physarum polycephalum (though they are amoeba, not fungi, as true molds are). ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=308))

- In similar experiments, slime molds have re-created the motorway network of the United States and the network of Roman roads in central Europe. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=316))
- Whether one calls slime molds, fungi, and plants “intelligent” depends on one’s point of view. Classical scientific definitions of intelligence use humans as a yardstick by which all other species are measured. According to these anthropocentric definitions, humans are always at the top of the intelligence rankings, followed by animals that look like us (chimpanzees, bonobos, etc.), followed again by other “higher” animals, and onward and downward in a league table—a great chain of intelligence drawn up by the ancient Greeks, which persists one way or another to this day. Because these organisms don’t look like us or outwardly behave like us—or have brains—they have traditionally been allocated a position somewhere at the bottom of the scale. Too often, they are thought of as the inert backdrop to animal life. Yet many are capable of sophisticated behaviors that prompt us to think in new ways about what it means for organisms to “solve problems,” “communicate,” “make decisions,” “learn,” and “remember.” ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=321))
- For your community of microbes—your “microbiome”—your body is a planet. Some prefer the temperate forest of your scalp, some the arid plains of your forearm, some the tropical forest of your crotch or armpit. Your gut (which if unfolded would occupy an area of thirty-two square meters), ears, toes, mouth, eyes, skin, and every surface, passage, and cavity you possess teem with bacteria and fungi.

- Someone got up to talk about a group of plants that produced a certain group of chemicals in their leaves. Until then, the chemicals had been thought of as a defining characteristic of that group of plants. However, it transpired that the chemicals were actually made by fungi that lived in the leaves of the plant. Our idea of the plant had to be redrawn. Another researcher interjected, suggesting that it may not be the fungi living inside the leaf that produced these chemicals but the bacteria living inside the fungus. Things continued along these lines. After two days, the notion of the individual had deepened and expanded beyond recognition. To… ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=345))
- Many scientific concepts—from time to chemical bonds to genes to species—lack stable definitions but remain helpful categories to think with. From one perspective, “individual” is no different: just another category to guide human thought and behavior. Nonetheless, so much of daily life and experience—not to mention our philosophical, political, and economic systems—depends on individuals that it can be hard to stand by and… ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=354))

- But I continue to wonder how, in our total dependence on fungi—as regenerators, recyclers, and networkers that stitch worlds together—we might dance to their tune more often than we realize. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=375))
- Regardless, imagination forms part of the everyday business of inquiring. Science isn’t an exercise in cold-blooded rationality. Scientists are—and have always been—emotional, creative, intuitive, whole human beings, asking questions about a world that was never made to be catalogued and systematized.

- Once eaten, a truffle’s job is done: An animal has been lured into exploring the soil and recruited to carry the fungus’s spores off to a new place and deposit them in its feces. A truffle’s allure is thus the outcome of hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary entanglement with animal tastes. Natural selection will favor truffle fungi that match the preferences of their finest spore dispersers. Truffles with better “chemistry” will attract animals more successfully than those with worse. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=464))
- THE HUMAN SENSE of smell is extraordinary. Our eyes can distinguish several million colors, our ears can distinguish half a million tones, but our noses can distinguish well over a trillion different odors. Humans can detect virtually all volatile chemicals ever tested. We outperform rodents and dogs in detecting certain odors, and we can follow scent trails. Smells feature in our choice of sexual partners and in our ability to detect fear, anxiety, or aggression in others. And smell is woven into the fabric of our memories; it is common for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to have olfactory flashbacks. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=478))
- this way, small causes can ripple into large effects: Human noses can detect some compounds at as low a concentration as thirty-four thousand molecules in one cubic centimeter, the equivalent of a single drop of water in twenty thousand Olympic swimming pools. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=489))
- Fungi are equipped with different kinds of bodies. They don’t have noses or brains. Instead, their entire surface behaves like an olfactory epithelium. A mycelial network is one large chemically sensitive membrane: A molecule can bind to a receptor anywhere on its surface and trigger a signaling cascade that alters fungal behavior. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=493))
- In 2007, a single 1.5 kilogram truffle was sold at auction for £165,000—like diamonds, the price of truffles increases nonlinearly with their size. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=542))
- Truffles had evolved to communicate to animals their readiness to be eaten. Humans and dogs had developed ways to communicate with one another about truffles’ chemical propositions. A truffle’s ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=556))
- Hyphae must be able to tell if they are bumping into a branch of themselves or another fungus entirely. If another, they need to be able to tell whether it is a different—potentially hostile—species, or a sexually compatible member of its own, or neither. Some fungi have tens of thousands of mating types, approximately equivalent to our sexes ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=634))
- For a truffle fungus like Tuber melanosporum to fruit, the hyphae of one mycelial network must fuse with those of a separate, sexually compatible network and pool genetic material. For most of their lives, as mycelial networks, truffle fungi live as separate mating types, whether “-” or “+”—by fungal standards, their sexual lives are straightforward. Sex happens when a - hypha attracts and fuses with a + hypha. One partner plays a paternal role, providing genetic material only. The other plays a maternal role, providing genetic material and growing the flesh that matures into truffles and spores. Truffles differ from humans in that either + or - mating types can be maternal or paternal—it is as if all humans were both male and female and equally able to play the part of a mother or a father, provided we could have sex with a partner of the opposite mating type. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=641))
- Closely related fungi use pheromones to attract mates, and researchers have a strong suspicion that truffles, too, use a sex pheromone for this purpose. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=648))
- Both fungal hyphae and plant roots face the challenge of finding one another amid the chemical babble in the soil where countless other roots, fungi, and microbes course and engage. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=653))
- Both plant and fungus use volatile chemicals to make themselves attractive to one another, just as truffles make themselves attractive to animals in a forest. Receptive plant roots produce plumes of volatile compounds that drift through the soil and cause spores to sprout and hyphae to branch and grow faster. Fungi produce plant growth hormones that manipulate roots, causing them to proliferate into masses of feathery branches—with a greater surface area, the chances of an encounter between root tips and fungal hyphae become more likely. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=655))

- In response to each other’s distinctive chemical profiles, signaling cascades ripple through plant and fungal cells, activating suites of genes. Both reorient their metabolisms and developmental programs. Fungi release chemicals that suspend their plant partners’ immune responses, without which they can’t get close enough to form symbiotic structures. Once established, mycorrhizal partnerships continue to develop. Connections between hyphae and roots are dynamic, formed and reformed as root tips and fungal hyphae get old and die. These are relationships that ceaselessly remodel themselves. If you could place your olfactory epithelium into the soil, it would feel like the performance of a jazz group, with the players listening, interacting, responding to one another in real time. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=661))
- Yet the mycelium of truffle fungi, like that of most fungal species, actively senses and responds to its surroundings in unpredictable ways. Their hyphae are chemically irritable, responsive, excitable. It is this ability to interpret the chemical emissions of others that allows fungi to negotiate a series of complex trading relationships with trees; to knead away at stores of nutrients in the soil; to have sex; to hunt; or to fend off attackers. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=715))
- the indigenous Potawatomi language is rich in verb forms that attribute aliveness to the more-than-human world. The word for “hill,” for example, is a verb: to be a hill. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=722))
- Equipped with this “grammar of animacy,” it is possible to talk about the life of other organisms without either reducing them to an “it” or borrowing concepts traditionally reserved for humans. By contrast, in English, writes Kimmerer, there is no way to recognize the “simple existence of another living being.” If you’re not a human subject, by default you’re an inanimate object: an “it,” a “mere thing.” If you repurpose a human concept to help make sense of the life of a nonhuman organism, you’ve tumbled into the trap of anthropomorphism. Use “it,” and you’ve objectified the organism and fallen into a different kind of trap. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=724))
- sense of the world—our investigative tools—be so? Might we be able to expand some of our concepts, such that speaking might not always require a mouth, hearing might not always require ears, and interpreting might not always require a nervous system? Are we able to do this without smothering other life-forms with prejudice and innuendo? ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=730))
- Lefevre told me about the theory that manna—the providential food that sustained the Israelites during their passage through the desert—was in fact the desert truffle, a delicacy that erupts without warning from arid ground across much of the Middle East. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=750))
- Fungi may not have brains, but their many options entail decisions. Their fickle environments entail improvisation. Their trials entail errors. Whether in the homing response of hyphae within a mycelial network, the sexual attraction between two hyphae in separate mycelial networks, the vital fascination between a mycorrhizal hypha and a plant root, or the fatal attraction of a nematode to a fungal toxic droplet, fungi actively sense and interpret their worlds, even if we have no way of knowing what it is like for a hypha to sense or interpret. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=762))
- think of fungi as articulating themselves using a chemical vocabulary, arranged and rearranged in such a way that it might be interpreted by other organisms, whether nematode, tree root, truffle dog, or New York restaurateur.

- Mycelium is ecological connective tissue, the living seam by which much of the world is stitched into relation. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=788))
- She arranged soil into the shape of the British landmass and marked cities using blocks of wood colonized with a fungus (the sulfur tuft, or Hypholoma fasciculare). The size of the wood blocks was proportional to the population of the cities they represented. “The fungi grew out from the ‘cities’ and made the motorway network,” Boddy recounted. “You could see the M5, M4, M1, M6. I thought it was quite fun.” ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=811))
- Researchers at the Unconventional Computing Laboratory at the University of the West of England have used slime molds to calculate efficient fire evacuation routes from buildings. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=825))
- mycelial fungi are maze-dwellers, and solving spatial and geometrical problems is what they have evolved to do. How best to distribute their bodies is a question fungi face on a moment-to-moment basis. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=829))
- Fungi can choose all possible routes at once. If the fungus discovers something to eat, it reinforces the links that connect it with the food and prunes back the links that don’t lead anywhere. One can think of it in terms of natural selection. Mycelium overproduces links. Some turn out to be more competitive than others. These links are thickened. Less competitive links are withdrawn, leaving a few mainline highways. By growing in one direction while pulling back from another, mycelial networks can even migrate through a landscape. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=834))
- A mycelial network has no head and no brain. Fungi, like plants, are decentralized organisms. There are no operational centers, no capital cities, no seats of government. Control is dispersed: Mycelial coordination takes place both everywhere at once and nowhere in particular. A fragment of mycelium can regenerate an entire network, meaning that a single mycelial individual—if you’re brave enough to use that word—is potentially immortal. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=863))
- Some organisms—like most animals—find food in the world and put it inside their bodies, where it is digested and absorbed. Fungi have a different strategy. They digest the world where it is and then absorb it into their bodies. Their hyphae are long and branched, and only a single cell thick—between two and twenty micrometers in diameter, more than five times thinner than an average human hair. The more of their surroundings that hyphae can touch, the more they can consume. The difference between animals and fungi is simple: Animals put food in their bodies, whereas fungi put their bodies in the food. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=877))
- pressure. In cases where mycelium has to break through particularly tough barriers, as disease-causing fungi do when infecting plants, they develop special penetrative hyphae that can reach pressures of fifty to eighty atmospheres and exert enough force to penetrate the tough plastics Mylar and Kevlar. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=896))
- The hyphae of some species grow so fast that one can watch them extend in real time. Hyphal tips must lay down new material as they advance. Small bladders filled with cellular building materials arrive at the tip from within and fuse with it at a rate of up to six hundred a second. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=904))
- You can think of your life like this. The growing tip is the present moment—your lived experience of now—which gnaws into the future as it advances. The history of your life is the rest of the hypha, the blue lines that you’ve left in a tangled trail behind you. A mycelial network is a map of a fungus’s recent history and is a helpful reminder that all life-forms are in fact processes not things. The “you” of five years ago was made from different stuff than the “you” of today. Nature is an event that never stops. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=910))
- “We commonly think of animals and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is continually passing.” When we see an organism, from a fungus to a pine tree, we catch a single moment in its continual development. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=914))
- When hyphae felt together to make mushrooms, they rapidly inflate with water, which they must absorb from their surroundings—the reason why mushrooms tend to appear after rain. Mushroom growth can generate an explosive force. When a stinkhorn mushroom crunches through an asphalt road, it produces enough force to lift an object weighing 130 kilograms. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07WKJS8P1&location=917))
- Mycelium is polyphony in bodily form. Each of the women’s voices is a hyphal tip, exploring a soundscape for itself. Although each is free to wander, their wanderings can’t be seen as separate from the others. There is no main voice. There is no lead tune. There is no central planning. Nonetheless, a form emerges.

- When the English country house Haddon Hall was being renovated, a fruiting body of the dry-rot fungus Serpula was found in a disused stone oven. Its mycelial connections wound back through eight meters of stonework to a rotting floor elsewhere in the building. The floor was where it fed, the oven was where it fruited.

- Objects within a few millimeters cause the fruiting body of Phycomyces to bend away without ever making contact. Regardless of the object—opaque or transparent, smooth or rough—Phycomyces starts to bend away after about two minutes.
