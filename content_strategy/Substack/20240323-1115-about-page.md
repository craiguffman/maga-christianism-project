# About Common Life Politics

## Our Core Question

"How do we love our neighbor well?" This remains the vital question at the heart of Common Life Politics—the path to both individual fulfillment and communal flourishing.

This newsletter wrestles with three dimensions of loving our neighbor well:
- Our faithful response to the poor, sick, and lonely
- Our calling to construct a shared life with those whose ways are strange or even hostile to us
- How to steward the power that shapes these relationships most fruitfully

## Our Theological Framework: Participatory Freedom

What unifies these explorations is what I call "Participatory Freedom Theology"—a framework that understands freedom not as absence of constraint but as participation in communities characterized by love without domination.

This approach draws on:
- **Douglas Campbell's** critique of contractual "Justification Theory" in favor of participation in Christ's resurrection
- **Samuel Wells'** incarnational emphasis on "being with" others rather than doing things for them or to them
- **Philip Pettit's** political conception of freedom as non-domination rather than non-interference
- **Luke Bretherton's** vision of common life politics that enables mutual flourishing

Together, these insights reveal freedom as participation in divine and human communities where arbitrary power is systematically dismantled, enabling all to flourish.

This vision directly counters what I call "MAGA Christianism"—a religious-political fusion characterized by seven theological mutations:
1. Primitive Biblicism
2. Hermeneutical Reductionism
3. Practical Atheism
4. Transactional Soteriology
5. Binary Apocalypticism
6. Dominion Theology
7. Epistemological Tribalism

## Five Pathways of Exploration

Common Life Politics follows five distinct but interconnected paths:

### MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (Mondays)
A theological analysis of the seven mutations that transform Christian symbols and language into political tools, with each chapter offering a constructive alternative through Participatory Freedom Theology.

### "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (Tuesdays)
Personal reflections connecting spiritual growth with physical transformation, exploring how participation in creation's processes illuminates participation in divine life without domination.

### 12-Part Series (Wednesdays)
Two successive 12-part series exploring foundational theological concepts. While drafted before the full articulation of Participatory Freedom Theology, these series examine themes of covenant relationship, truthfulness, love, and freedom that provide the groundwork for understanding participation without domination. These Wednesday series will also be published as Kindle ebooks.

### "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (Thursdays)
My personal journey of discovering how American history contains both systems of domination and movements toward genuine participation, weaving together historical research and my own awakening from the "Lost Cause" mythology.

### "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (Fridays)
Satirical pieces that contrast dominative frameworks with participatory alternatives, employing irony and humor to reveal the gap between stated values and actual practices.

## My Perspective

As a practical theologian, I approach these questions from what I call a "Reformed Catholic" perspective—drawing on both the Reformation's emphasis on grace and the Catholic tradition's emphasis on participation in divine life. I'm a Christian theologian and priest who formerly served as a Navy submarine officer and a high-tech company president. I currently serve on the Theology Committee of the House of Bishops of The Episcopal Church.

My scholarly journey prepared me to develop Participatory Freedom Theology as a response to our current religious-political crisis.

My ecclesial journey gave me decades of ecumenical experience with the questions asked by folks struggling to understand how faith shapes participation in public life.

My business experience—I've led innovation, struggled to meet payrolls, and harvested the fruit of my labors as a capitalist—gave me existential understanding of both market dynamics and the dangers of reducing freedom to mere economic autonomy.

My military experience shaped me in innumerable ways, perhaps most importantly by instilling in me a deep, abiding love for and a passionate commitment to the American experiment as a laboratory for creating systems that enable participation without domination.

All these threads percolate throughout my exploration of participatory freedom as an alternative to both secular libertarianism and religious authoritarianism.

## Our Covenant

I will share well-researched facts and arguments about how we construct communities of participatory freedom and do all in my power to equip, encourage, and inspire us to achieve that; in response, you use these things to carry on this grand project, sharing them and adding your own to equip and inspire others to join us.

Because participation is inherently communal, this learning space will always be a work in progress. What you encounter here is like what you'd find in my backyard garden—some fertile soil, some seedlings planted alongside well-established annuals and perennials in the shade of evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees. It's never complete or authoritative, and often not the best I can do. But that imperfection is not a defect; it's a feature because the joy of gardening is as much in preparing, planting, tending, and harvesting as it is in consuming.

I endorse and embrace a simple rule of life for our covenant. I ask readers to allow me to be wrong, offer and receive constructive criticism, and attribute my work. I promise to be considerate of visitors (don't share private information or name and shame), offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to feedback. I ask that all readers embrace this covenant as the basis of our relationship.
