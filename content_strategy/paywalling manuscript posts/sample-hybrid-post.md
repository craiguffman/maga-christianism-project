## America's Forgotten Oligarchic Tradition

When we think about American origins, our imagination often defaults to familiar stories: Pilgrims seeking religious freedom, pioneers pushing westward, or revolutionaries demanding independence. But there's another founding tradition that has shaped American development just as profoundly yet receives far less attention in our national mythology.

This alternative tradition begins not with freedom-seekers but with the Barbadian planter class that established the Carolina colonies. These weren't refugees from religious persecution but the extension of an already-profitable slave society seeking new land for expansion. They brought with them a distinctive social, economic, and theological system that would become one of America's most influential templates for organizing power.

What makes this historical thread so significant for understanding contemporary America—and particularly MAGA Christianism—is how its fundamental patterns of dominative power have persisted from plantation to platform.

**This post explores how America's hierarchical tradition has evolved from plantation capitalism to contemporary tech oligarchy, and how MAGA Christianism functions as a restorationist project seeking to rebuild elements of these historical systems of dominance.**

## The Barbadian Template for American Oligarchy

The Barbadian planter class that colonized the Carolina Lowcountry didn't arrive in America seeking to build a "city upon a hill" or escape persecution. They came to expand an already-profitable economic model that fused:

1. **Multi-tiered Social Hierarchy**: A rigid social structure with the planter class at the top, followed by overseers, small farmers, indentured servants, and enslaved people at the bottom.

2. **Proto-Corporate Structure**: Plantations operated with absentee ownership, professional management, and commodified labor—early versions of corporate entities.

3. **Religious Justification**: Anglican religious structures sacralized this social order while maintaining strict political control.

4. **Strategic Inheritance**: Marriage and inheritance patterns concentrated wealth and power in family dynasties.

5. **Institutional Replication**: Barbadian governance, legal, and social structures were replicated in American settlements.

This system represented a fundamental alternative to New England's town meeting democracy and the Middle Colonies' pluralism. Where other colonial models emphasized (limited) participation, the Barbadian model emphasized hierarchy and control.

## King Cotton: America's First Great Oligarchy

The antebellum Cotton Kingdom (roughly 1800-1860) saw this Barbadian model expand throughout the Deep South, creating America's first true oligarchy. This system developed several distinctive features:

### Theological Innovation

Southern theologians developed America's "first truly original contribution to theology" (as historian Mark Noll puts it) by crafting elaborate biblical defenses of slavery and hierarchy as divinely ordained institutions. This theological framework:

- Created hermeneutical methods that consistently produced pro-slavery interpretations
- Developed a hierarchical anthropology that justified different rights for different groups
- Framed challenges to the system as challenges to divine order itself
- Established a theological binary that categorized opponents as enemies of God

Sound familiar? These same patterns appear in contemporary MAGA Christianism's approach to scripture and social order.

### Financial Sophistication

The plantation system created sophisticated financial instruments that securitized human beings, connecting plantation economics to Wall Street and European markets. This included:

- Mortgage-backed securities using enslaved people as collateral
- Complex insurance products protecting human "property"
- Futures markets in cotton that financialized plantation production
- Banking systems built on enslaved human collateral

This financial sophistication has parallels in contemporary financialization that abstracts human activity into tradable securities.

### Political Domination

Despite representing a minority of the population, the "Slave Power" exercised disproportionate federal influence through:

- Disproportionate representation via the three-fifths compromise
- Control of the presidency for most of the antebellum period
- Dominance of the Supreme Court
- Veto power over legislation through Senate control

This pattern of minority rule through institutional leverage has clear parallels in contemporary political arrangements.

### Post-War Adaptation

Most remarkably, this system demonstrated extraordinary resilience. After military defeat and the formal end of slavery, the planter class reconstructed systems of dominance through:

- "Separate but equal" doctrines replacing explicit slavery defenses
- Sharecropping, convict leasing, and debt peonage as legal substitutes for slave labor
- Systematic disenfranchisement of Black political participation
- Cultural codes enforcing racial hierarchy
- Regional identity built around "heritage" narratives

This adaptability demonstrates how dominative systems can survive formal legal changes while maintaining their essential power structures.

## From Plantation to Platform: Contemporary Parallels

The connections between this historical tradition and contemporary tech oligarchy appear in several striking parallels:

### 1. Patrimonial Capitalism

Today's tech oligarchs often exhibit patrimonial tendencies similar to plantation capitalism:

- **Elon Musk's Neo-Feudalism**: Musk's companies function like modern plantations—demanding total loyalty, maintaining strict hierarchies, controlling workers' off-hours behavior, and cultivating dependency relationships.

- **Peter Thiel's Explicit Feudalism**: Thiel has explicitly advocated for neo-feudal political arrangements, rejecting democracy in favor of hierarchical systems similar to plantation society.

- **Tech Company Compounds**: Enclosed company towns mirror plantation self-sufficiency and control over workers' lives.

- **Dynastic Wealth Transfer**: The emphasis on passing wealth to children parallels plantation aristocracy's concern with bloodline succession.

### 2. Quasi-Theological Narratives

Like plantation owners who used religion to justify their position, contemporary oligarchs deploy quasi-theological narratives:

- "Creative destruction" as inevitable and ultimately beneficial (despite casualties)
- "Disruption" as a moral good regardless of consequences
- "Meritocracy" as justification for extreme inequality
- "Innovation" as inherently positive regardless of social costs

These function similarly to theological justifications for plantation hierarchy—providing moral legitimation for dominative arrangements.

### 3. Financial Abstraction

Just as plantation capitalism developed sophisticated financial instruments that abstracted human beings into fungible assets, contemporary financialization abstracts productive activity into tradable securities:

- Human activity repackaged as data to be monetized
- Work reframed as "gigs" without employee protections
- Housing transformed from shelter to investment vehicle
- Social relationships monetized as "engagement"

### 4. Political Capture

Similar to the "Slave Power" that dominated antebellum politics despite representing a minority, contemporary oligarchic influence operates through disproportionate political power:

- Regulatory capture across multiple agencies
- Tax avoidance strategies unavailable to ordinary citizens
- Direct platform control over public discourse
- Strategic philanthropy shaping policy agendas

## MAGA Christianism as Restorationist Project

Seen through this historical lens, MAGA Christianism represents not just a reaction to post-1960s changes but a restorationist project seeking to rebuild elements of these historical systems of dominance:

### 1. Theological Parallels

Biblical inerrancy functions similarly to proslavery theology—providing apparently objective hermeneutical methods that consistently produce interpretations supporting existing power structures. Both systems:

- Claim direct access to biblical meaning while actually employing highly selective interpretation
- Create binary frameworks categorizing opponents as enemies of God
- Subordinate Jesus's example to other biblical passages that can be interpreted to support hierarchy
- Develop elaborate theological frameworks justifying social domination

### 2. Cross-Class Coalition

The coalition supporting MAGA Christianism parallels the antebellum South's political alignment:

- **Oligarchic Leadership**: Wealthy elites provide financial support and institutional infrastructure
- **Professional-Managerial Enforcement**: A middle class that enforces norms and receives status benefits
- **Working-Class Identification**: Working-class whites receive psychological wages of superiority
- **Religious Sanctification**: Religious institutions that sacralize these arrangements

This coalition structure shows remarkable continuity from the antebellum period through Jim Crow to contemporary MAGA politics.

### 3. Restoration Narrative

The "Make America Great Again" slogan explicitly calls for returning to an imagined past that maps closely onto these historical periods of dominance. The desire to "restore" America often means restoring:

- Clear racial and gender hierarchies
- Christian cultural dominance
- Unquestioned patriarchal authority
- "Natural" economic stratification

### 4. Economic Vision

The combination of deregulation for the powerful with strict regulation for the powerless mirrors plantation capitalism's selective application of "free market" principles:

- Freedom for capital, constraint for labor
- Property rights prioritized over human rights
- Social safety nets dismantled while corporate subsidies expand
- "Law and order" for the poor, legal impunity for the wealthy

## Freedom as Domination vs. Freedom as Participation

This historical through-line helps us understand the theological distortion at the heart of both plantation capitalism and MAGA Christianism: a fundamental misunderstanding of freedom.

In the plantation system, "freedom" meant the right of owners to exercise dominion without constraint. In contemporary oligarchic capitalism, "freedom" means the ability of platforms to operate without democratic accountability. In MAGA Christianism, "freedom" means the ability to impose one's religious vision without constraint.

All three represent what philosopher Philip Pettit calls "freedom as non-interference"—the idea that freedom merely means absence of constraint. This understanding sees relationships as potential intrusions on autonomy rather than as constitutive of personhood.

This conception stands in stark contrast to the Christian understanding of freedom as participation in God's life—what theologian Luke Bretherton calls "freedom as non-domination." In this vision, we are truly free not when we are autonomous but when we participate in relationships without domination.

This theological distortion explains the seeming contradiction in MAGA Christianism's simultaneous embrace of oligarchic capitalism and nationalist Christianity. Both represent the same underlying theological error—mistaking dominative power for genuine freedom.

## Theological Resources for Alternative Visions

What theological resources might help us imagine alternatives to these systems of dominance? Three approaches offer particular promise:

### 1. Freedom as Non-Domination

Freedom properly understood means not absence of interference but absence of domination—the capacity to live without arbitrary power exercised over you. This concept, developed in republican political theory and enriched by Christian theology, provides a framework for economic arrangements that:

- Prevent arbitrary power through democratic accountability
- Enable meaningful participation rather than mere consumer choice
- Sustain relationships of gift-exchange rather than mere contract
- Recognize the unique particularity of persons and communities

### 2. Embedded Economic Life

Markets function best when properly embedded within:

- Democratic governance that holds economic power accountable
- Moral frameworks that recognize human dignity beyond utility
- Social bonds that sustain community across difference
- Political deliberation that shapes economic decisions toward common goods

### 3. Complex Economic Space

Genuine freedom requires what Bretherton calls "complex space"—institutional plurality that prevents both state and market domination through:

- Mediating institutions that enable meaningful participation
- Democratic subsidiarity that locates decisions at appropriate levels
- Overlapping loyalties that prevent absolute claims by any institution
- Constitutional frameworks that protect rights and limit concentrations of power

## Conclusion: Beyond Dominative Power

Understanding the historical through-line from plantation to platform helps us see MAGA Christianism not as an aberration but as the latest manifestation of America's tradition of dominative power. This perspective reveals how contemporary religious-political formations seek to restore historical patterns of hierarchy and control while using updated theological justifications.

But this historical understanding also points toward alternative possibilities. If our current disorders stem from a theological mistake about freedom, power, and human flourishing, then genuine theological renewal might help imagine economic and political arrangements more conducive to human dignity.

The path forward lies not in either progressive triumphalism or reactionary nostalgia, but in recovering theological resources for understanding freedom as participation, power as creative rather than dominative, and human flourishing as rooted in communion rather than domination.
