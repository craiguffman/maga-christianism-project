# Facebook Pre-Launch Communication Strategy

## Teaser Campaign: 6-8 Weeks Before Launch

### Content Pillars
1. **Personal Story Teasers**
   - Short video clips (90 seconds) revealing personal moments that shaped your theological journey
   - Example: "The water fountain liturgy that changed everything" 
   - Focus on vulnerability and transformation

2. **Provocative Question Series**
   - Weekly graphics/posts that challenge current political and religious narratives
   - Examples:
     - "What if faith is about connection, not conquest?"
     - "Can we talk about truth without becoming tribal?"
     - "What does real freedom look like beyond political slogans?"

3. **Behind-the-Scenes Development**
   - Share glimpses of book/essay writing process
   - Occasional screenshots of research materials
   - Short reflections on book's conceptual development

## Engagement Tactics

### Audience Targeting
- Naval Academy alumni
- Episcopal church networks
- Academic theology groups
- Veterans' communities
- Political theory discussion groups

### Interaction Strategies
- Respond to comments personally
- Ask provocative follow-up questions
- Share 2-3 sentence personal reflections that invite dialogue

### Graphic Design Approach
- Use Midjourney to create conceptual images that blend military, theological, and democratic imagery
- Consistent color palette: Rich browns, healing blues, vibrant greens (matching "Rooted & Reaching" aesthetic)
- Typography that balances academic credibility with approachability

## Content Cadence
- 3-4 posts per week
- Varied media: Text, graphics, short videos
- Increasing frequency as launch approaches

## Launch Week Amplification
- Daily countdown posts
- Testimonial snippets from early readers
