# Comment Moderation Guidelines: Cultivating Faithful Dialogue

## Core Principles of Engagement

### 1. Hospitality as Theological Practice
- We view each comment as an opportunity for mutual understanding
- Our goal is not to win arguments, but to create space for deeper reflection
- Every person who comments is a bearer of God's image, worthy of respect

### 2. Boundaries with Generosity
- Respectful disagreement is welcome
- Personal attacks, hate speech, and deliberately inflammatory comments will be removed
- We seek to create a community of learning, not a battlefield of competing claims

## Moderation Criteria

### Approved Comments Will:
- Engage substantively with the ideas presented
- Ask genuine questions
- Offer alternative perspectives with charity
- Demonstrate an attempt to understand before being understood

### Comments That May Be Removed:
- Ad hominem attacks
- Repetitive proof-texting without contextual understanding
- Deliberately misleading statements
- Attempts to derail conversation
- Comments that violate basic human dignity

## Response Template Framework

### Template 1: Responding to Substantive Critique
```
Thank you for your thoughtful engagement. Your point about [specific aspect] raises an important consideration. In my research, I've found that this complexity reveals [deeper theological insight]. I'm curious - how might we explore this further in a way that honors the fullness of our theological tradition?

My own journey has taught me that [brief personal insight related to the critique]. What has your experience been?
```

### Template 2: Redirecting Aggressive Comments
```
I sense there's a deeper concern behind your comment. While I may not agree with all of your interpretations, I'm genuinely interested in understanding the heart of your perspective. Would you be willing to share what experiences or convictions are shaping your view?

My work isn't about attacking fellow Christians, but about inviting us all to a more generous and transformative understanding of our faith.
```

### Template 3: Dealing with Dismissive Comments
```
I appreciate that my theological analysis might feel challenging. These are complex issues that require patience, humility, and a willingness to sit with discomfort. My goal isn't to condemn, but to invite a deeper conversation about how we faithfully live out our Christian calling in a complex world.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to recommend some resources that might provide additional context for the theological perspectives I'm exploring.
```

## Practical Moderation Workflow

## Community Covenant

We believe that faithful dialogue requires:
- Listening before speaking
- Assuming the best in one another
