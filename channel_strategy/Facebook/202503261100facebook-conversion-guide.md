## Content Conversion Guidelines

### Overall Approach
- Reduce word count by 60-70% (aim for 300-500 words)
- Maintain the core message and key points
- Preserve author's voice and unique perspective

### Structure Elements
1. **Title**: Keep original, unmodified
2. **Opening Hook**: Preserve but condense to 1-2 sentences
3. **Main Points**: Convert to bullet points where appropriate
4. **Personal Stories**: Include abbreviated version of ONE key story
5. **Conclusion**: Maintain emotional resonance while shortening
6. **Call to Action**: Add a question to encourage comments
7. **Series Note**: Include standard text about Tuesday series
8. **Footnote**: Add witty footnote from approved rotation

### Formatting for Facebook
- Use headers sparingly (H1 for title only)
- Break up text with bullet points for scannability
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use bold for key concepts or phrases
- Include white space between paragraphs

### Content Elements to Prioritize
- Maintain personal narrative voice
- Keep vivid metaphors (garden, running, etc.)
- Preserve theological insights but simplify language
- Retain one strong personal anecdote
- Keep memorable phrases and unique terminology

### Content Elements to Reduce/Remove
- Extensive theological context
- Multiple supporting examples
- Lengthy descriptive passages
- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Secondary stories or anecdotes
- Extended metaphors
- Nuanced qualifications of main points

## Specific Series Guidelines

### Monday: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters
- Focus on one key theological concept
- Remove most theological/academic context
- Convert complex arguments to simple statements
- Include one provocative insight that encourages further reading

### Tuesday: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays
- Emphasize personal connection and vulnerability
- Keep garden/fitness/cooking metaphors but simplify
- Maintain authenticity while reducing reflective depth
- Focus on practical application or insight

### Wednesday: 12-Part Faith Series / Lexicon Entries
- For lexicon: provide simplified definition and one example
- For series: focus on practical application of theological concept
- Remove most historical context and theological nuance
- Include visual/sensory examples when possible

### Thursday: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals
- Focus on one surprising historical revelation
- Keep personal connection to historical content
- Remove most historical context and documentation
- Emphasize "I never knew" element

### Friday: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces
- Keep identical on both platforms
- No footnote required

## Witty Footnote Rotation
Choose one footnote from the approved rotation document, ensuring variation from week to week.

## Image Guidelines

### Aspect Ratio
- Facebook: 1:1 square format for optimal feed display
- SubStack: 16:9 horizontal format for header display

### Visual Elements
- Maintain "Rooted & Reaching" aesthetic: earthy, authentic, natural
- Use imagery that connects to key metaphors in the post
- Avoid text in images (Facebook will penalize)
- Include human element when appropriate (hands, figure, etc.)

### Midjourney Parameters
- Always include `--style raw` for authentic feel
- Always include `--no text` to prevent generated text
- Specify aspect ratio: `--ar 1:1` for Facebook
- Use photographic style rather than illustration unless specifically desired

## Example Conversion

### SubStack Original (excerpt)
"Our culture continually reinforces these external measurements. Open any social media app and you'll find countless variations of the same message: success means more followers, more influence, more productivity, more material abundance.

Even in church contexts, we often adopt secular metrics with spiritual language: congregation size, budgets, programs offered. And in my own life, I've frequently fallen into the trap of measuring my spiritual journey by sermons preached, adults and children mentored in faith, or theological arguments won."

### Facebook Conversion
"Our culture constantly pushes external measurements of success: more followers, more influence, more productivity, more stuff.
