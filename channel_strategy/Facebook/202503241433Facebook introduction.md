# A New Chapter in Our Conversations

Dear friends,

Over the past few years, many of our conversations here have touched on the deep questions facing our faith, our nation, and our common life together. Your thoughtful engagement has been a gift, and I've been reflecting on how to create a more intentional space for these exchanges.

I'm excited to share that I'm reimagining how I'll be sharing content both here and on my Substack, "Common Life Politics." Rather than the somewhat random posting schedule I've maintained, I'm working toward a more structured approach that I hope will provide different entry points for our ongoing conversation.

My vision (ambitious, I know!) is to develop several content streams that speak to different aspects of our shared journey:

**12-Part Series on Common Life Politics** - This series, inspired largely by conversations with many of you here, will explore theological foundations for shared life across differences. Many of you have helped shape my thinking on duty, honor, country, justice, empathy, and freedom - the core concepts we'll explore together.

**"Rooted & Reaching"** - Personal essays exploring how my journey through recovery, health transformation, and connection to the land informs my theological understanding.

**"Untold America"** - Confessional essays about discovering the "other half" of American history I never learned, weaving my personal awakening with historical insights.

**MAGA Christianism Book Project** - I'm also working on a book examining the theological dynamics of this movement. The research and writing process will inform regular chapters and analyses I'll share as the project develops.

**Lexicon Entries** - Brief explanations of key terms and concepts that appear throughout my writing.

While I'd *love* to produce content in all these streams regularly, reality will likely intervene! Consider this an aspiration rather than a promise. Some weeks might see multiple posts, others might be quiet as life, work, and reflection demand.

What I can promise is that each piece will be written with care and in the spirit of genuine dialogue. My hope is that whether you're drawn to personal narrative, historical exploration, theological reflection, or satirical commentary, you'll find something that resonates.

I'd welcome your thoughts on what aspects of this vision most interest you. Your feedback will help shape where I focus my limited energy in the coming months.

With gratitude for your friendship and engagement,
Craig
