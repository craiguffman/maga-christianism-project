 #From Plantation to Platform: The Theological Mutations of MAGA Christianism

This title effectively captures several key elements of our analysis:

1. The historical continuity of dominative systems from plantation capitalism to contemporary platform capitalism
2. The theological framework of three mutations as our core analytical approach
3. The specific focus on MAGA Christianism rather than broader Christian nationalism

The title works on multiple levels:
- It immediately signals the historical scope of our analysis
- It creates a memorable and evocative image
- It distinguishes our work from other books on similar topics
- It hints at both critique and constructive alternative

This title will help readers understand that our analysis goes beyond merely examining contemporary phenomena to tracing deep historical patterns of dominative power and their theological justifications.

I think this is an excellent choice that reflects the depth and uniqueness of our approach. Would you like me to suggest any adjustments to the table of contents or chapter titles to better align with this new title?
