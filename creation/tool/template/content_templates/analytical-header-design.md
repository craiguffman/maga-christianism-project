# Analytical Posts: Header Image Design Specification

## Core Design Elements

### Base Template (1200x630px)
- **Dimensions**: Wider/taller than lexicon headers (1200x630px) for immediate visual distinction
- **Background Style**: Full-bleed photographic or textured backgrounds (vs. gradients in lexicon)
- **Overlay**: Semi-transparent dark overlay (60% opacity) to ensure text readability
- **No Border Elements**: Absence of "spine" line or bottom line that appears in lexicon entries

### Typography
- **Main Title**: Short, impactful headline in Helvetica Neue Bold (or similar sans-serif), 52pt, white, centered
- **No Subtitle**: Clean look without permanent subtitle text (unlike lexicon entries)
- **No Entry Numbers**: No numbering system (to distinguish from lexicon entries)

### Visual Elements
- **Photography**: Each post uses a unique, conceptually relevant photograph
- **Image Treatment**: Slightly desaturated photographs with increased contrast
- **Optional Accent**: Subtle red highlight element (small line or shape) to draw attention

## Content Categories & Visual Treatments

### Analysis Posts
- Dramatic imagery: institutional buildings, political gatherings, church architecture
- Darker color palette with higher contrast
- Example topics: "The Theology of Grievance," "Power Structures in Religious Politics"

### Commentary Posts
- Human-focused imagery: profiles, crowds, expressions
- Warmer color temperature
- Example topics: "Responding to Christian Nationalism," "The Moral Center"

### Trend Analysis
- Data-suggestive imagery: patterns, trends, technological elements
- Cooler, more neutral color temperature
- Example topics: "The Rise of Digital Evangelism," "Tracking Political Theology"

## Implementation Notes

1. **Image Selection Guidelines**
   - Use high-quality stock photography (Unsplash, Pexels)
   - Avoid overly literal or clich√©d religious imagery
   - Select images with natural space for text overlay
   - Maintain conceptual relevance without being too on-the-nose

2. **Canva Setup**
   - Create as a 1200x630px template with text zones defined
   - Save basic overlay and typography settings as a template
   - Create a collection of pre-selected, appropriate images

3. **Text Placement**
   - Center headlines for analytical posts (vs. left-aligned for lexicon)
   - Keep headlines concise (5-8 words ideal)
   - Use title case for analytical posts (vs. term-definition style of lexicon)

4. **Naming Convention**
   - Save files as: `analysis_[shortened-title]_[date].png`
   - Example: `analysis_theology-grievance_20250318.png`

## Example Mockup Description

**The Theology of Grievance**
- Dramatic wide shot of a rally with American flags and religious symbols
- Dark overlay making the image recede while maintaining its conceptual power
- "The Theology of Grievance" in large, bold white sans-serif, centered
- Small red accent line beneath the title
- Overall darker, more dramatic feel than the clean blue lexicon entries

This design approach creates an immediate visual distinction between your analytical content and lexicon entries. While the lexicon headers have a clean, reference-like quality with consistent blue gradients, your analytical posts will feature rich, unique photography with dramatic overlays that signal "this is a perspective piece" rather than a definition.

The contrasting visual language helps readers immediately understand what type of content they're engaging with, even before reading a word.
