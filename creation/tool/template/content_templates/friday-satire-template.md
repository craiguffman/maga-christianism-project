### Distinctive Features of Friday Satire

- **Icon**: ðŸ“œ (Scroll) representing governmental proclamations being satirized
- **Purpose**: Exposing theological contradictions through governmental satire
- **Voice**: Official, bureaucratic, absurdly formal
- **Structure**: Governmental proclamation with sections, articles, and appendices
- **Length**: 800-1200 words
- **Key Feature**: Absurd metrics, authorities, and implementation timelines
- **URL Pattern**: `republic-[topic]`

### Satire Approach Guidelines

1. **Target Systems, Not Individuals**: Focus satire on theological systems and power structures, not specific people
2. **Mirror Don't Mock**: Use satire to hold up a mirror to theological mutations rather than simply mocking them
3. **Equal Opportunity Critique**: Alternate focus between Dominative Christianism and Providential Identitarianism
4. **Exaggeration Not Fabrication**: Exaggerate real contradictions rather than fabricating false ones
5. **Reveal Don't Ridicule**: Use satire to reveal theological truths rather than merely ridiculing opponents
6. **Punch Up Not Down**: Direct satirical critique at systems of power, not vulnerable communities

### Lexicon Integration Approach

Friday satire integrates lexicon concepts through satirical definitions and absurd protocols:

1. **Satirical Definitions**: Include satirical definitions that expose the flaws in theological concepts
2. **Absurd Protocols**: Create protocols that reveal the contradictions in theological mutations
3. **Committee Names**: Use committee member titles that satirize theological authority structures
4. **Metrics and Standards**: Develop metrics that satirize reductive approaches to complex realities
5. **No Direct References**: Avoid direct lexicon references with links in the main content
6. **End-of-Article Links**: Include relevant lexicon terms in related content section only

### Formatting Guidelines

1. **Headers**: Use # for title (with icon), ## for main sections
2. **Official Formatting**: Use bold for official headers, regular text for content
3. **Bureaucratic Structure**: Maintain numbered sections, subsections, and appendices
4. **Official Notice**: Format using blockquote syntax for special notices
5. **Header Image**: Include mock governmental seal or certificate as header image
6. **Section Dividers**: Use `---` for horizontal rules between major sections
7. **Signature Block**: Include satirical authorities with titles
8. **Related Content**: Include 6-8 related content links

### Publication Process

1. Copy the completed artifact content
