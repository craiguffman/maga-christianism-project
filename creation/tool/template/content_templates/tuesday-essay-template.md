# Tuesday Personal Essay Template v1.0

This template provides the standardized structure for creating Tuesday Personal Essay artifacts for the Rooted & Reaching series. Use this template when requesting artifacts from Claude or when creating content manually.

## Template Structure

The template includes all necessary sections, formatting elements, and cross-reference structures required for Tuesday personal essays. It follows a distinctive format that centers on personal narrative while connecting to broader theological themes.

# ðŸŒ± [TITLE]

[Opening scene or vignette that introduces the personal experience related to the essay's theme. This should be vivid, specific, and grounded in sensory details that immerse the reader in a particular moment.]

[Second paragraph that begins to draw out the significance of this experience. This should start to reveal why this personal story matters beyond its immediate context.]

[Third paragraph that establishes the broader theme of the essay and how it connects to the weekly theme. This should be subtle rather than explicit, allowing the personal narrative to carry the thematic weight.]

## [Section 1: Beginning the Journey]

[First paragraph continuing the personal narrative, focusing on initial encounters with the challenge or opportunity at the heart of the essay.]

[Second paragraph that deepens the personal story with specific details, dialogue, or inner thoughts that reveal the stakes involved.]

[Third paragraph that begins to introduce metaphor or analogy drawn from gardening, cooking, or endurance training that will develop throughout the essay. This should feel organic to the narrative rather than forced.]

*A moment of reflection or realization, set apart in italics to indicate a shift in perspective or a key insight.*

[Fourth paragraph that subtly connects this personal experience to broader patterns without becoming explicitly theological or political. The connection should be implied rather than stated.]

## [Section 2: Confronting Obstacles]

[First paragraph exploring the complications or challenges that emerged in this personal journey.]

[Second paragraph developing the difficulty with specific examples, sensory details, or dialogue that makes the challenge concrete.]

[Third paragraph deepening the metaphor established earlier, showing how it illuminates the nature of the challenge being faced.]

*Another reflective moment that reveals growing understanding or a shift in perspective, again set in italics.*

[Fourth paragraph that hints at theological or spiritual dimensions without becoming academic or abstract. The insight should feel earned through experience rather than imposed from outside.]

## [Section 3: Finding a Path Forward]

[First paragraph describing a turning point or moment of clarity in the personal narrative.]

[Second paragraph exploring the specific practices or insights that emerged from this turning point. Be concrete and practical rather than abstract.]

[Third paragraph developing the central metaphor further, showing how it reveals new dimensions of understanding.]

*A deeper reflective moment that captures a significant realization or transformation, set in italics.*

[Fourth paragraph that more explicitly connects this personal journey to broader spiritual formation, though still primarily through the lens of personal experience rather than abstract theology.]

## [Section 4: Integrating the Lesson]

[First paragraph showing how this experience has been integrated into ongoing life and practice.]

[Second paragraph describing specific changes in perspective, habit, or relationship that have resulted from this journey.]

[Third paragraph bringing the metaphor to its fullest development, revealing how it illuminates not just this specific experience but a broader pattern of spiritual formation.]

*Final reflective moment that captures the essence of what has been learned, set in italics.*

[Fourth paragraph that makes a subtle connection to the theological mutations without naming them explicitly. Show how this personal journey offers an alternative to dominant patterns without becoming polemical.]

## Conclusion

[First paragraph returning to the opening scene or image with new perspective, creating a sense of narrative completion.]

[Second paragraph offering a broader reflection on what this journey reveals about spiritual formation or human flourishing.]

[Third paragraph extending an implicit invitation to the reader to consider their own experience in light of this narrative.]

[Final paragraph that returns to the central metaphor one last time, leaving the reader with a vivid image that encapsulates the essay's meaning.]

### Distinctive Features of Tuesday Essays

- **Icon**: ðŸŒ± (Seedling) representing growth, cultivation, and personal formation
- **Purpose**: Exploring spiritual formation through personal narrative
- **Voice**: First-person, intimate, reflective, non-academic
- **Structure**: Scene-setting, journey, transformation, integration
- **Length**: 1500-2000 words
- **Key Feature**: Italicized reflective moments that mark shifts in understanding
- **Central Metaphors**: Drawn from gardening, cooking, or endurance training
- **URL Pattern**: `rooted-[topic]`

### Lexicon Integration Approach

Unlike other content types, Tuesday essays integrate lexicon concepts implicitly rather than explicitly:

1. **No Direct References**: Avoid direct lexicon references with links
2. **Implicit Integration**: Incorporate concepts through metaphor and personal story
3. **Subtle Connections**: Allow readers to make connections without explicit pointers
4. **End-of-Article Links**: Include relevant lexicon terms in related content section only
5. **Experiential Approach**: Show theological concepts through lived experience rather than abstract explanation

This approach maintains the personal, non-academic voice of the Tuesday essays while still connecting to the broader theological framework.

### Formatting Guidelines

1. **Headers**: Use # for title (with icon), ## for main sections
2. **Reflective Moments**: Use *italics* for reflective asides
3. **Metaphors**: Develop central metaphor consistently throughout essay
4. **Images**: Include header image that relates to central metaphor
5. **Section Dividers**: Use `---` for horizontal rules between major sections
6. **Phase Identification**: Include phase information in "From My Garden" section
7. **Related Content**: Include 6-8 related content links

### Publication Process

1. Copy the completed artifact content
2. Create new post in Substack

5. Configure custom URL following pattern: `rooted-[topic]`
