# Weekly Integration Process v2.0

This workflow document provides a comprehensive system for maintaining thematic integration and cross-reference consistency across all content streams using the artifact-based approach. Following this process ensures that all content published within a weekly theme remains cohesively connected while maintaining proper reference integrity.

## Weekly Theme Architecture

The weekly theme architecture provides the structural framework that unifies all content streams published within a given week. Each weekly theme:

- Centers on a specific theological concept or idea
- Connects to a specific Mark sermon passage
- Addresses aspects of both Dominative Christianism and Providential Identitarianism
- Presents a participatory freedom theological alternative

### Weekly Theme Components

1. **Core Concept**: The central theological idea for the week
2. **Sermon Connection**: The primary Mark passage and counter-imperial insight
3. **Theological Mutation Focus**: The primary mutation(s) addressed
4. **Alternative Vision**: The constructive theological alternative presented
5. **Cross-Stream Applications**: How the theme manifests in each content stream

## Artifact-Based Weekly Integration Workflow

### 1. Theme Planning Phase (4-6 Weeks in Advance)

#### Weekly Theme Artifact Creation
- **Request Theme Artifact**: Use the following prompt with Claude:

```
Please create a weekly theme integration artifact for Week [NUMBER] with the following specifications:

Theme Title: [THEME TITLE]
Core Concept: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CENTRAL IDEA]
Mark Passage: [SPECIFIC MARK PASSAGE]
Theological Mutations: [PRIMARY MUTATIONS ADDRESSED]
Constructive Alternative: [THEOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVE]

Content Stream Applications:
- Monday: [HOW THEME APPLIES TO DOMINATIVE/PROVIDENTIAL CHAPTERS]
- Tuesday: [HOW THEME APPLIES TO PERSONAL ESSAYS]
- Wednesday: [HOW THEME APPLIES TO THEOLOGICAL ESSAYS]
- Thursday: [HOW THEME APPLIES TO HISTORICAL ESSAYS]
- Friday: [HOW THEME APPLIES TO SATIRICAL PIECES]

Required Lexicon Entries:
- [TERM 1]: [BRIEF EXPLANATION OF RELEVANCE]
- [TERM 2]: [BRIEF EXPLANATION OF RELEVANCE]
- [TERM 3]: [BRIEF EXPLANATION OF RELEVANCE]

The artifact should follow our standard weekly theme integration template with proper cross-reference structure and implementation guidelines.
```

- **Review Theme Artifact**: Ensure the artifact includes:
  - Clear thematic structure
  - Specific applications for each content stream
  - Required lexicon entries
  - Cross-reference framework
  - Implementation guidelines

- **Finalize Theme Artifact**: Store the completed artifact in VSCode and Tana

#### Lexicon Preparation
- Identify all lexicon terms needed for the weekly theme
- Create lexicon entry artifacts for any missing terms
- Publish lexicon entries at least 2 weeks before they'll be referenced
- Update main glossary with new entries
- Verify all lexicon cross-references are functioning

#### Sermon Integration Planning
- Create sermon integration artifact connecting Mark passage to weekly theme
- Develop triple voice structure (Mark/Dominative/Providential)
- Identify key sermon insights that connect to each content stream
- Create sermon reference framework for cross-content integration

### 2. Content Creation Phase (2-4 Weeks in Advance)

#### Content Artifact Request Framework
- For each content stream, request artifacts using this framework:

```
Please create a [CONTENT TYPE] artifact for the Week [NUMBER] theme "[THEME TITLE]" with the following specifications:

Title: [CONTENT TITLE]
Weekly Theme Connection: [HOW THIS PIECE CONNECTS TO THEME]
Sermon Connection: [HOW THIS CONNECTS TO MARK PASSAGE]
Key Sections: [LIST OF MAIN SECTIONS]
Lexicon Terms to Reference: [LIST OF TERMS TO INCLUDE]
Cross-Content References:
- [RELATED CONTENT PIECE 1]
- [RELATED CONTENT PIECE 2]
- [RELATED CONTENT PIECE 3]

The artifact should follow our standard [CONTENT TYPE] template with proper formatting and cross-references that maintain weekly integration.
```

- Develop content artifacts in order of publication:
  1. Monday: Dominative Christianism or Providential Identitarianism chapter
  2. Tuesday: Personal essay
  3. Wednesday: Theological essay
  4. Thursday: Historical essay
  5. Friday: Satirical piece

#### Cross-Reference Management in Artifacts
- Include standardized cross-reference sections in each artifact:
  
```markdown
---

### Related Content

- [Monday: [Title] →](/p/dominative-topic)
- [Tuesday: [Title] →](/p/rooted-topic)
- [Wednesday: [Title] →](/p/commonlife-topic)
- [Thursday: [Title] →](/p/untold-topic)
- [Friday: [Title] →](/p/republic-topic)
- [Sermon: [Title] →](/p/sermon-mark-passage)
- [Weekly Theme: [Title] →](/p/theme-week-number)

---
```

- Use standardized URL patterns for all cross-references:
  - Monday Dominative: `dominative-[topic]`
  - Monday Providential: `providential-[topic]`
  - Tuesday Personal: `rooted-[topic]`
  - Wednesday Theological: `commonlife-[topic]`
  - Thursday Historical: `untold-[topic]`
  - Friday Satirical: `republic-[topic]`
  - Lexicon Entries: `lexicon-[term]`
  - Sermon Content: `sermon-[passage]`
  - Weekly Theme: `theme-[week-number]`

- Include lexicon references using inline format:
  - First mention: `[*Term*](/p/lexicon-term)`
  - End-of-article glossary

#### Content Artifact Review
- Verify that each artifact:
  - Properly connects to weekly theme
  - Includes appropriate sermon references
  - Contains correct lexicon references
  - Uses correct URL patterns for cross-references
  - Maintains consistent formatting standards

### 3. Publication Phase (Current Week)

## Cross-Reference Consistency Management

### URL Pattern Enforcement
Maintaining consistent URL patterns is critical for cross-reference integrity. All content must follow these established patterns:

| Content Type | URL Pattern | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Monday Dominative | `dominative-[topic]` | `dominative-primitive-biblicism` |
| Monday Providential | `providential-[topic]` | `providential-covenant-theology` |
| Tuesday Personal | `rooted-[topic]` | `rooted-metrics-matter` |
| Wednesday Theological | `commonlife-[topic]` | `commonlife-bullshit` |
| Thursday Historical | `untold-[topic]` | `untold-textbook-lied` |
| Friday Satirical | `republic-[topic]` | `republic-library-renovation` |
| Lexicon Entries | `lexicon-[term]` | `lexicon-dominative-christianism` |
| Sermon Content | `sermon-[passage]` | `sermon-mark-1-1-15` |
| Weekly Themes | `theme-[week-number]` | `theme-01-introduction` |

### Artifact-Based Cross-Reference Validation System

To ensure all cross-references maintain consistency when adding new content, follow this validation process:

1. **Cross-Reference Registry Artifact**
   - Maintain a centralized artifact listing all content URLs
   - Update registry when creating new content artifacts
   - Use registry to validate cross-references during content creation
   - Check registry before publishing to confirm URL consistency

2. **URL Validation Artifact**
   - Create a validation artifact that checks all cross-references
   - Run validation before publishing each content piece
   - Identify any inconsistencies or broken references
   - Correct issues before publication

3. **Post-Publication Verification Artifact**
   - After publishing, create verification artifact that tests published URLs
   - Document any issues for immediate correction
   - Update content if errors are found
   - Maintain record of verification for each weekly theme

### Managing URL Changes and Updates

If content URLs must change after publication:

1. **Create Redirect Artifact**
   - Generate artifact documenting old and new URLs
   - Update all cross-references in related content
   - Implement URL redirect if possible on Substack
   - Create minimal content at old URL that directs to new URL

2. **Systematic Reference Update**
   - Develop comprehensive list of all content referencing changed URL
   - Update each reference systematically
   - Document all updates for verification
   - Check all updates to ensure proper implementation

3. **Search Engine Notification**
   - If URL structure changes significantly, create sitemap update
   - Submit updated sitemap to search engines
   - Monitor search indexing for proper updates
   - Address any search-related issues promptly
