## Implementation Notes

1. **Canva Setup**

   - Save each category variation as a separate template
   - Use the color picker to precisely match gradient colors

2. **Production Workflow**
   - Duplicate the appropriate category template
   - Update the term name and entry number
   - Add/adjust subtitle if needed
   - Export as PNG at high quality

3. **Naming Convention**
   - Save files as: `lexicon_[term-name]_[entry-number].png`
   - Example: `lexicon_christianism_01.png`
