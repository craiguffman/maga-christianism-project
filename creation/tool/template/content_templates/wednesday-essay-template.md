# ðŸ“š [TITLE]

[Opening paragraph that introduces the theological concept in accessible language. This should draw the reader in with a concrete example, metaphor, or contemporary reference that helps ground the abstract theological concept in everyday experience.]

[Second paragraph that establishes why this concept matters in our current moment. This should connect the theological virtue or concept to specific challenges in contemporary religious and political life.]

[Third paragraph that connects to the weekly theme and relevant sermon passage. This paragraph should explicitly mention the connection to Mark's counter-imperial message and how it challenges both Dominative Christianism and Providential Identitarianism.]

## Theological Foundations

[First paragraph establishing the theological grounding of the concept. This should connect to orthodox theological tradition while remaining accessible.]

[Second paragraph that explores the biblical foundations of the concept. Include specific scriptural references without becoming excessively technical.]

[Third paragraph that places this concept within the broader theological framework of participatory freedom. Include an inline lexicon reference using the format: [*Participatory Freedom*](/p/lexicon-participatory-freedom).]

> **KEY INSIGHT**: A particularly important theological insight that deserves emphasis and helps readers grasp the central idea.

[Fourth paragraph that connects this theological concept to one or more of the seven theological mutations. Include an inline lexicon reference using the format: [*Primitive Biblicism*](/p/lexicon-primitive-biblicism).]

## Contemporary Expressions

[First paragraph introducing how this theological concept manifests in contemporary religious and political life.]

[Second paragraph exploring specific examples of distortions or misappropriations of this concept. Be specific without becoming overly partisan.]

[Third paragraph analyzing how this concept appears differently in Dominative Christianism and Providential Identitarianism. Highlight both similarities and differences in these expressions.]

[Fourth paragraph that connects to relevant sermon insights using the format: As explored in our analysis of [Mark 1:16-20](/p/sermon-mark-1-16-20), Jesus offers an alternative vision that challenges both mutations.]

## Practices for Cultivation

[First paragraph introducing how this theological virtue or concept can be cultivated through specific practices.]

[Second paragraph describing a particular practice that individuals can adopt to cultivate this virtue. Be concrete and practical.]

[Third paragraph describing a communal practice that groups can adopt to cultivate this virtue together. Again, be specific and actionable.]

[Fourth paragraph connecting these practices to counteracting the theological mutations. Show how intentional practice builds resistance to theological distortions.]

## Theological Integration

[First paragraph connecting this concept to related theological virtues or concepts in the series. Demonstrate how these concepts work together within a coherent theological framework.]

[Second paragraph exploring how this concept contributes to a more holistic understanding of Christian faith and practice. Show how it complements rather than competes with other theological virtues.]

[Third paragraph connecting to the participatory freedom theological framework and its trinitarian foundations. Include an inline lexicon reference to a relevant theological alternative.]

[Fourth paragraph that returns to the weekly theme with specific connection to Jesus's counter-imperial message in Mark.]

## Conclusion

[First paragraph summarizing the key insights about this theological concept.]

[Second paragraph highlighting why this concept matters for faithful Christian witness in our divided age.]

[Third paragraph offering a specific call to reflection or action connected to this virtue.]

[Final paragraph returning to the opening example or metaphor with new depth of understanding.]
