# Writing Style Guide

## Voice and Tone
- **Academic but accessible**: Maintain scholarly rigor while writing in a way that educated non-specialists can understand
- **Balanced**: Present multiple perspectives fairly, even when critiquing certain positions
- **Analytical**: Focus on evidence-based analysis rather than polemics
- **Respectful**: Treat all subjects, including those you disagree with, with appropriate dignity
- **Clear**: Avoid unnecessary jargon; when specialized terms are needed, define them

## Language Considerations
- Use inclusive language that acknowledges diversity within religious and political groups
- Avoid politically charged terminology except when directly quoting sources
- Distinguish between descriptive and normative claims
- Be precise when discussing religious concepts; acknowledge denominational differences
- Use "MAGA Christianism" as a descriptive term, not a pejorative one

## Structure and Organization
- Each chapter should begin with a clear thesis statement
- Provide signposting to guide readers through complex arguments
- Use subheadings to break up lengthy sections
- End each chapter with a summary that connects to the book's overall thesis
- Include relevant examples and case studies to illustrate abstract concepts

## Citations and References
- Follow Chicago Manual of Style (17th Edition) for citations
- Use footnotes for substantive comments and endnotes for references
- Include a comprehensive bibliography organized by category
- When citing religious texts, specify the translation being used
- For online sources, capture screenshots or use archiving services to preserve ephemeral content

## Specific Terminology Guidelines
- "Christian nationalism" - use precisely to describe the fusion of Christian identity with nationalist politics
- "Evangelicalism" - acknowledge the diversity within this tradition; specify subgroups when possible
- "MAGA" - primarily use in relation to the political movement, not as a general adjective
- "Christianism" - distinguish from Christianity; define as the politicized adaptation of Christian elements
- "Theological" vs. "Political" - be clear about which dimension is being discussed

## Quotations and Primary Sources
- Provide adequate context for all quotations
- When analyzing rhetoric, consider both explicit and implicit meanings
- Fact-check all quotations and attribute them accurately
- When analyzing controversial statements, present the full context
- Balance quotations from leaders with perspectives from ordinary participants

## Visual Elements
- Use charts and graphs to illustrate demographic trends
- Include thoughtfully selected photographs that illustrate key events
- Consider timelines to show the evolution of movements
- Use sidebars for biographical information about key figures
- Include text boxes for definitions of specialized terms
