    <p>It was my 65th birthday when the question hit me like a medicine ball to the chest: "What metrics am I using to measure my life?"</p>
    
    <p>I stood in my garden, surveying the young fruit trees I'd planted the previous autumn. They showed no fruit yetâ€”nothing but tender branches reaching skyward. By conventional metrics, they were underperforming assets: high input, zero yield. Yet I felt a strange satisfaction watching them establish their root systems, knowing that their seeming unproductivity masked essential, invisible work.</p>
    
    <p>At 65, I found myself reflecting on the metrics that had defined my own life. For decades, I had tracked progress through accomplishments, credentials, income, influence. These were the standard units of measurement for a life well-livedâ€”especially for a man raised in achievement-oriented mid-century America. Even in ministry, I tracked sermons delivered, books written, committees chaired. I measured my spiritual life by prayer minutes logged and Scripture passages memorized.</p>
    
    <p>But standing among those fruitless trees, I wondered: Have I been measuring what truly matters?</p>
    
    <h2>The Metrics We Inherit</h2>
    
    <p>We inherit metrics before we choose them. My father, a proud businessman, tracked his success in promotions and salary increases. My mother, though never employed outside our home, measured her days in meals prepared, surfaces cleaned, children raised. Their Depression-era upbringing made productivity the ultimate virtue, idleness the unforgivable sin.</p>
    
    <p>The church of my youth had its own metrics: attendance, baptisms, giving. Even personal holiness was quantifiedâ€”how many times did you pray today? Did you have your quiet time? How many people did you witness to this week?</p>
    
    <p>These metrics weren't inherently wrong, but they were incomplete. They privileged the visible over the invisible, output over input, doing over being.</p>
    
    <p>In my 30s, as a naval officer, I measured success by rank achievements and performance evaluations. In my 40s, as a business executive, the metrics shifted to revenue growth and market share. In my 50s, as I entered ministry, I adopted ecclesiastical metricsâ€”congregation size, giving trends, program participation.</p>
    
    <p>Always measuring, always counting, always comparing.</p>
    
    <h2>The Health Crisis That Changed Everything</h2>
    
    <p>At 58, my metrics system collapsed. A serious health crisisâ€”brought on partly by the stress of constant achievementâ€”forced me to stop. Everything stopped. For months, I couldn't work, couldn't exercise, couldn't meet the most basic metrics I'd established for a successful day.</p>
    
    <p>In that forced stillness, I began to notice different measurements. The depth of my breathing. The steadiness of my heartbeat. The quality of my presence with loved ones. The spaciousness of unstructured time for prayer and contemplation.</p>
    
    <p>Recovery wasn't linear, and my progress couldn't be plotted on a spreadsheet. Some days, success meant simply showing up for my life with authenticity rather than performing it with excellence. Other days, it meant acknowledging my limitations rather than overcoming them.</p>
    
    <p>I began to question whether my previous metrics had been measuring flourishing or merely functioning.</p>
    
    <h2>The Wisdom of Perennials</h2>
    
    <p>My garden became my teacher. Perennial plantsâ€”those that return year after yearâ€”follow different patterns than annuals. They spend their first years building root systems rather than producing showy flowers or abundant fruit. To the untrained eye, they appear to be failing. But the experienced gardener knows: they're not failingâ€”they're establishing.</p>
    
    <p>At 65, I find myself living more like a perennial and less like an annual. Annual plants operate from scarcity, pouring all their energy into rapid growth and reproduction before the season ends. Perennials operate from sufficiency, knowing there will be future seasons, investing in deep roots that will sustain decades of fruitfulness.</p>
    
    <p>The metrics that matter in perennial living are different:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Not how much you produce, but how deeply you're rooted</li>
        <li>Not how far you've climbed, but how well you've integrated growth</li>
        <li>Not how many you've impressed, but how many you've truly known</li>
        <li>Not how much you control, but how much you've surrendered</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These metrics can't be easily quantified or compared. They don't translate well to performance reviews or social media updates. They're metrics of soul-making rather than resume-building.</p>
    
    <h2>Learning New Measurements</h2>
    
    <p>Retraining myself to value these different metrics hasn't been easy. I still find myself instinctively counting, achieving, producing. But slowly, I'm learning to measure what truly matters:</p>
    
    <p><strong>From quantity of religious activities to quality of divine encounter</strong>. I've stopped logging prayer minutes and started noticing moments of genuine presence with Godâ€”in formal prayer, yes, but also while kneeling in garden soil or sitting with a grieving friend.</p>
    
    <p><strong>From professional influence to relational depth</strong>. Rather than counting how many people I've impacted, I'm noticing how well I've listened, how vulnerably I've shared, how faithfully I've shown up.</p>
    
    <p><strong>From financial growth to generosity quotient</strong>. The metric isn't how much I've accumulated but how freely I can release it, how unclenched my hands have become.</p>
    
    <p><strong>From productivity to fruitfulness</strong>. Productivity measures output regardless of meaning; fruitfulness measures output that brings life to others and glory to God.</p>
    
    <p>This shift has been particularly important in my health journey. I no longer judge a workout by calories burned or miles covered, but by how it connected me to my body, how it fostered gratitude for movement, how it built sustainable strength rather than impressive performance.</p>
    
    <h2>The Liberation of Better Metrics</h2>
    
    <p>There's a profound liberation in measuring what truly matters. When productivity is your primary metric, rest feels like failure. When achievement drives your worth, limitation feels like punishment. When comparison determines your value, community becomes competition.</p>
    
    <p>But when your metrics shift toward rootedness, presence, integration, and surrender, everything changes. Rest becomes essential rather than indulgent. Limitation becomes invitation rather than obstacle. Community becomes communion rather than competition.</p>
    
    <p>At 65, I'm learning that the most important growth often happens underground, invisible to others and sometimes even to ourselves. Like those young fruit trees in my garden, the most essential work isn't always evident in visible outcomes. The metrics that truly matter are often hidden from immediate view.</p>
    
    <p>So I'm establishing new measurements for this season of life. Not how much I produce, but how deeply I notice. Not how many I influence, but how authentically I love. Not how much I control, but how completely I trust.</p>
    
    <p>These are the metrics that matterâ€”the ones that measure not just success but flourishing, not just achievement but abundance, not just progress but peace.</p>
