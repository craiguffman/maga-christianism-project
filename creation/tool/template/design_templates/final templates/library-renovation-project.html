    <h2>OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION OF THE DIVINE REPUBLIC</h2>
    <h3>Classification: PATRIOTIC TRUTH BULLETIN</h3>
    
    <p>By the power vested in THE DIVINE REPUBLIC HERITAGE PRESERVATION COMMITTEE, we hereby announce:</p>
    
    <div class="divider"></div>
    
    <h2>THE LIBRARY OF AMERICAN GREATNESS RENOVATION PROJECT</h2>
    
    <p>Imagine the history of America as a vast library. For years, librarians have been working to catalog and display books representing all the authors who contributed to building this library - including works written by women, Black, Asian, Native American, LGBTQ+ authors, and others.</p>
    
    <p>But now there's a new management team running the "Library Renovation Committee":</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "We're not removing any books," they insist while wheeling out carts of volumes. "We're simply reorganizing for clarity! These particular books were only added recently due to political correctness."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>They install a new wing called "Traditional American Greatness" with spotlights and leather chairs, filled exclusively with books by a very specific demographic of authors. Meanwhile, they move all other books to the basement storage area labeled "Special Interest Collections" - accessible only through a maze of unmarked hallways, with limited hours and a special permission slip.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "We're just restoring the library to its original, natural organization," they explain while actively painting over the diverse murals in the entryway. "The real discrimination would be forcing visitors to see books they didn't specifically request."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>When visitors ask about certain missing displays, the committee responds: "Those stories? They were probably exaggerated anyway. And if they were truly great, they'd naturally be in our main collection without any special help."</p>
    
    <p>The new library handbook clarifies that while technically all books remain in the building, only works that "promote an optimistic view of American heritage" deserve prime shelf space. Books documenting slavery, indigenous genocide, women's suffrage struggles, civil rights movements, or labor exploitation are classified as "Divisive Historical Interpretations" and require special permission to access.</p>
    
    <p>A small but vocal group of patrons has enthusiastically endorsed the renovation:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "Finally, I can browse American history without feeling uncomfortable! I used to avoid the library because there were too many stories that made me question things I'd rather not think about."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>When professional historians object to the reorganization, they're quickly labeled "elitist information manipulators" who are "threatened by the democratization of historical narrative."</p>
    
    <p>The Library Renovation Committee has announced a new feature: "Heritage-Friendly History Hours" where specially trained guides will lead tours highlighting "the inspiring, unified American story" while carefully navigating around any exhibits that might "unnecessarily complicate the patriotic narrative."</p>

        <p><strong>Pastor Flagg Waverly, PhD in American Exceptionalism:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            "This library renovation returns us to the pure vision of our founders, who definitely would have wanted it this way."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><strong>Congresswoman Faith Prosperity:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            "Seeing all those other books was making traditional Americans feel uncomfortable. Balance means putting the right books first."
