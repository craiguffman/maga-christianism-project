    <p>The textbook sat on my childhood desk in Baton Rouge, its cover adorned with the familiar tableau: Pilgrims in buckled hats stepping onto Plymouth Rock, the Mayflower anchored in the background. Inside, the story unfolded just as I expected‚Äîa linear progression from English colonies to American independence, with other peoples appearing as footnotes, obstacles, or later additions to the "real" American story.</p>
    
    <p>I never questioned this narrative. Why would I? It appeared in every classroom, museum, and Thanksgiving pageant of my youth. America began with English settlers seeking religious freedom, who built a new nation based on liberty and opportunity. Other groups‚Äîthe Irish, Italians, Chinese, and later waves of immigrants‚Äîcame afterward to join what was already established. Native Americans were present but mostly as backdrop characters who helpfully taught the Pilgrims to plant corn before conveniently fading from the main storyline.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn't until my late thirties, browsing a university bookstore while waiting for a colleague, that I picked up a volume that would shatter this tidy narrative: Carrie Gibson's <em>El Norte: The Epic and Forgotten Story of Hispanic North America</em>.</p>
    
    <p>There, on the first pages, I encountered a reality my textbooks had never mentioned: when the Mayflower landed in 1620, Spaniards had already established Santa Fe. By the time English colonists were building their first permanent settlements, Spain had been exploring and settling North America for over a century.</p>
    
    <p>I stood in that bookstore aisle, feeling something between vertigo and revelation. How had I never known this? What else had been excluded from the American origin story I'd been taught?</p>
    
    <p>That moment launched me on a journey to discover the America my textbooks never showed me‚Äîan America with multiple founding populations, each with their own claims to priority and significance in our national story.</p>
    
    <h2>The America That Already Existed</h2>
    
    <p>The first revelation was the most obvious yet somehow most obscured: Native American nations were not simply scattered tribes waiting for history to happen to them. They were complex, sophisticated civilizations with their own governance systems, technological innovations, trade networks, and diplomatic relations.</p>
    
    <p>The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy had established a democratic confederation with checks and balances that some scholars argue influenced the U.S. Constitution's framers. The Cahokia Mounds near present-day St. Louis evidence a pre-Columbian city larger than London was at the same time. The Comanche Empire controlled a territory spanning much of the American Southwest, effectively halting Spanish colonization through military and diplomatic prowess.</p>
    
    <p>These weren't primitive peoples easily swept aside by superior European civilization‚Äîa narrative my textbooks implied without stating outright. They were nations with their own histories, innovations, and agency, who shaped the continent's development as much as they were shaped by European contact.</p>
    
    <p>Why hadn't my education acknowledged their foundational role in American history? The answer was uncomfortable but inescapable: because acknowledging them as founding peoples would undermine the myth of America as essentially an Anglo-Protestant creation, a narrative that served to legitimize a particular power structure.</p>
    
    <h2>The Spanish America That Predated Plymouth</h2>
    
    <p>Gibson's <em>El Norte</em> was just my first introduction to the Spanish presence that long predated the English colonies my textbooks centered. By 1598, Juan de O√±ate had established the Province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, making it the first European settlement in what would become the United States. St. Augustine, Florida, founded in 1565, remains the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the country.</p>
    
    <p>Spanish explorers had mapped much of the North American continent while Jamestown was still decades in the future. Their influence shaped place names, agricultural practices, architecture, and legal traditions throughout what would become the American Southwest and Southeast.</p>
    
    <p>As I read historians like David J. Weber and Andr√©s Res√©ndez, I began to understand that the Spanish colonial experience wasn't just a prelude to "real" American history‚Äîit was American history, establishing patterns of cultural exchange, racial categorization, and economic development that would shape the nation for centuries.</p>
    
    <p>My textbooks had relegated Spanish colonization to a few paragraphs about conquistadors in Mexico and South America, treating North America as essentially English territory with brief Spanish incursions. The reality was far more complex and interconnected.</p>
    
    <h2>Four Englands, Not One</h2>
    
    <p>Even the English colonization story I'd been taught was a simplification bordering on mythology. Through David Hackett Fischer's <em>Albion's Seed</em>, I discovered that English America was never a monolith but comprised at least four distinct cultural patterns:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>The Puritan colonies of New England, founded by East Anglian Calvinists</li>
        <li>The Mid-Atlantic settlements established by Quakers from the English Midlands</li>
        <li>The Cavalier society of Virginia and the Chesapeake, dominated by aristocrats from Southern England</li>
        <li>The Backcountry settled by Scots-Irish from Northern Britain and Ulster</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These regional cultures brought different religious practices, family structures, political traditions, and speech patterns. They didn't represent a unified "English" colonization but distinct cultural transplantations that would develop into regional identities still recognizable today.</p>
    
    <p>Fischer's work helped me understand why New England town meetings differed so fundamentally from Virginia's hierarchical county governments, why linguistic patterns vary so dramatically between Boston and Charleston, and why political attitudes divide along regional lines to this day.</p>
    
    <p>The "founding" English were never a homogeneous group importing a singular culture‚Äîthey were diverse, often antagonistic populations establishing multiple versions of England in America.</p>
    
    <h2>When I Finally Met Frederick Douglass</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps the most significant gap in my textbook education was the erasure of Black Americans as founders rather than additions to American society. The narrative I'd been taught positioned enslaved Africans as laborers imported to serve an existing American project, not as architects of the nation itself.</p>
    
    <p>Reading works like Ibram X. Kendi's <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em> and Sven Beckert's <em>Empire of Cotton</em> revealed a different truth: the economy, political structures, and culture of America were built as much by enslaved Africans and their descendants as by European settlers.</p>
    
    <p>Cotton production‚Äîthe economic engine that fueled America's industrial revolution and international power‚Äîdepended on agricultural expertise brought from Africa. Southern cuisine, music, language, and architecture bore the unmistakable influence of African traditions. Black resistance to enslavement helped define and expand American concepts of freedom and citizenship.</p>
    
    <p>When I finally encountered Frederick Douglass not as a sidebar to "real" history but as a principal architect of American identity‚Äîthrough his writings, speeches, and political theory‚ÄîI began to understand the magnitude of what had been excluded from my education.</p>
    
    <p>Black Americans weren't peripheral to the founding; they were central to it, present at every stage of national development, their labor and cultural contributions inextricable from what America became.</p>
    
    <h2>The Railroads' Hidden Architects</h2>
    
    <p>My textbooks had briefly mentioned Chinese immigrants arriving during the Gold Rush and working on railroads, but cast them as temporary laborers who contributed manual work rather than becoming part of America's cultural fabric.</p>
    
    <p>Through works like Erika Lee's <em>The Making of Asian America</em> and Gordon H. Chang's <em>Ghosts of Gold Mountain</em>, I discovered the central role Chinese workers played in connecting the nation through the transcontinental railroad‚Äîa project typically portrayed as the triumph of white industrial ingenuity.</p>
    
    <p>Chinese laborers performed the most dangerous work, developing innovative techniques for blasting through mountains and laying track across treacherous terrain. Their expertise made possible what many considered technologically impossible. Yet when the Golden Spike ceremony commemorated the railroad's completion in 1869, Chinese workers were excluded from the official photographs.</p>
    
    <p>This pattern of contribution followed by erasure characterized much of Asian American history in my textbooks. Japanese agricultural innovations that transformed California farming, Filipino labor organizing that shaped workers' rights legislation, Korean entrepreneurs who revitalized urban neighborhoods‚Äîall were minimized or absent entirely.</p>
    
    <h2>The Border That Moved</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps the most profound revelation in my journey was understanding that for many Mexican Americans, particularly in the Southwest, their ancestors never immigrated to the United States‚Äîthe United States immigrated to them.</p>
    
    <p>The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War, transferred roughly half of Mexico's territory to the United States. Overnight, thousands of Mexican citizens found themselves living in a foreign country, their property rights, citizenship, and cultural practices suddenly precarious.</p>
    
    <p>As I read works like Juan Gonz√°lez's <em>Harvest of Empire</em> and Martha Menchaca's <em>Recovering History, Constructing Race</em>, I began to understand that the "immigration debate" I'd grown up with fundamentally mischaracterized the Mexican American experience. Many families had deeper historical roots in places like Texas, California, and Arizona than the Anglo Americans who later claimed to be the region's rightful inhabitants.</p>
    
    <p>This history explained the distinctive cultural landscape of the American Southwest‚Äîthe Spanish place names, legal traditions, architectural styles, and agricultural practices that weren't imports but indigenous elements of the region's development.</p>
    
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    
    <p>This journey from textbook mythology to complex historical reality wasn't merely academic. It transformed my understanding of American identity and challenged me to reconsider who "we" are as a nation.</p>
    
    <p>The single-origin myth of America as essentially an Anglo-Protestant project extended by permission to accommodate others serves political purposes: it establishes who are the "real Americans" with the authority to determine who belongs and on what terms.</p>
    
    <p>Recognizing America's multiple founding populations‚ÄîNative, Spanish, English, African, and others‚Äîrequires acknowledging that American identity has always been negotiated among diverse peoples, none with an exclusive claim to define what America is or should be.</p>
    
    <p>This isn't about replacing one simplistic narrative with another. It's about embracing the complex reality that America was never a single project but multiple projects in constant interaction, conflict, and synthesis.</p>
    
    <p>The textbook that sat on my childhood desk didn't just omit facts‚Äîit obscured the fundamental nature of American identity as multicultural from its inception. That matters because how we understand our past shapes how we engage our present and imagine our future.</p>
    
    <p>When we recognize America's multiple founding peoples, we can no longer speak of immigrants "assimilating to American culture" as if that culture existed prior to and independent of their contributions. We can no longer frame debates about national identity around returning to an imagined homogeneous past.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, we're called to the more difficult but ultimately more honest work of negotiating our shared identity across differences‚Äîjust as Americans have been doing since before the nation had a name.</p>
