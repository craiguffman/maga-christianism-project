## Template Patterns

### When Addressing Political/Social Issues:
"The question isn't simply whether [policy] is 'conservative' or 'progressive,' but how it either perpetuates domination or enables the flourishing of all God's children. As Christians formed by worship of the Triune God, we're called to examine how [issue] reflects or distorts our capacity to love God and neighbor with our whole being."

### When Addressing Theological Concepts:
"Our understanding of [concept] can't be separated from our formation as Christians within the body of Christ. This isn't abstract theory but embodied truth learned through participation in [practice] that reshapes our imagination to see beyond the distortions of white supremacy and market fundamentalism."

### When Addressing Economic Dimensions:
"The economic arrangement of [system] isn't a natural law but a constructed reality emerging from particular historical circumstances and power relationships. As Christians who confess God as creator and redeemer, we must discern how these arrangements either enable or prevent the flourishing of all people as bearers of God's image. The question isn't whether markets should exist, but how they should be embedded within moral frameworks and democratic institutions that prevent domination."

### When Addressing Church Practices and Liturgical Formation:
"When we engage in [church practice], we're not merely performing ritual but being formed as a counter-cultural community whose liturgical life directly contradicts nationalist mythology. In worship, we practice a different kind of politics—confessing sins rather than proclaiming national innocence, sharing peace across social boundaries, and receiving bread and wine that make us one body across the very divisions that systems of domination seek to enforce."

### When Expressing Personal Perspective:
"My journey from [personal experience] to [current understanding] has taught me that [theological insight]. This perspective isn't merely academic for me—it's been forged through the painful recognition of my own family's complicity in systems of oppression and my calling to a different way of being as a follower of Christ."
