I'd be happy to help you brainstorm and develop your theological concept of freedom as "interindependence." This is a rich area to explore, particularly in connection with your participatory freedom theology.

## Origins and Similar Concepts

The term "interindependence" isn't widely used in scholarly literature, making it a distinctive concept you could develop. Some related concepts include:

- **Interdependence** (common in ecological, economic, and relational theology)
- **Mutual indwelling** (perichoresis in Trinitarian theology)
- **Ubuntu** (the African concept of "I am because we are")
- **Relational autonomy** (in feminist ethics)

Your coinage of "interindependence" creates an intentional tension that captures both our individuality and our fundamental connectedness - a perfect theological paradox that reflects trinitarian reality.

## Theological Development

### Trinitarian Foundations

The mutual indwelling of the Trinity (perichoresis) provides the perfect theological grounding for interindependence. Consider developing this by exploring:

1. How each person of the Trinity maintains distinctiveness while fully participating in the others
2. The way trinitarian love creates space for the other rather than absorbing or dominating
3. How this divine dance of mutual indwelling becomes the pattern for human freedom

As you might say, "Freedom isn't just about having space to breathe; it's about drawing the world around us into God's love through our mutual indwelling with each other."

### Contrast with Independence

To sharpen this concept, contrast interindependence with modern notions of independence:

| Independence | Interindependence |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Freedom from others | Freedom with and for others |
| Autonomous self-determination | Relational self-giving |
| Non-interference | Mutual flourishing |
| Individual rights | Reciprocal responsibilities |
| Zero-sum thinking | Generative abundance |

### Phenomenological Dimensions

Experiencing freedom as interindependence would manifest in:

1. **Recognition** - Seeing ourselves reflected in others and others in ourselves
2. **Responsibility** - Understanding our actions as always affecting the web of relationships
3. **Reciprocity** - Giving and receiving in ways that enhance both parties' freedom
4. **Resilience** - Drawing strength from connections rather than isolation
5. **Reconciliation** - Healing divisions that prevent mutual flourishing

## Practical Implications

### Personal Formation

How does one grow in interindependence? Consider practices that:
- Cultivate awareness of our interconnections
- Develop capacity to be present to others without losing self
- Create space for both solitude and communion

### Political Dimensions

This understanding transforms political discourse by:
- Reframing freedom as enhancing mutual capacity rather than limiting interference
- Seeing democratic participation as practicing interindependence
- Rejecting both collectivism and individualism as insufficient

### Ecological Considerations

The concept naturally extends to our relationship with creation:
- Humans as both distinct from and fundamentally connected to creation
- Stewardship as mutual flourishing rather than dominion
- The earth as part of the web of interindependence that reflects God's nature

## Contemporary Relevance

Your concept directly addresses several contemporary challenges:

1. The atomization and loneliness epidemic in modern society
2. The false binary between individual freedom and collective responsibility
3. The political polarization that pits liberty against community
4. The ecological crisis stemming from failure to recognize our interindependence with creation

## Language and Accessibility

To make this concept accessible beyond academic theology, you might:

1. Ground it in everyday experiences of both independence and interconnection
2. Use examples from family life, friendship, and community
3. Connect it to familiar Christian practices like communion that embody interindependence
4. Develop a memorable phrase like "We are most ourselves when we are most for others" or your excellent "drawing the world around us into God's love"

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of this concept in more depth? I'm particularly interested in how you see this connecting to your critique of MAGA Christianism's conception of freedom.
