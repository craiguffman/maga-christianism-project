\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Integrating the Bowlin-Bretherton Insight into Your Book\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 Your observation about the relationship between Bowlin's robust account of tolerance and Bretherton's critique offers a valuable opportunity to deepen your theological critique of MAGA Christianism. Here's how you might integrate this insight into your book project:\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 1. In Chapter 4: The Formation of Virtue\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You could use this insight to illustrate how virtue formation requires nuanced understanding rather than simplistic moral categories:\
"The contrast between Bowlin's robust account of tolerance as virtue and Bretherton's preference for hospitality exemplifies the need for careful moral discernment. MAGA Christianism's tendency to collapse complex moral virtues into binary categories\'97where tolerance becomes mere relativism and strength becomes domination\'97reflects not just political polarization but a deeper failure of moral formation. What appears to be a contradiction between these theologians is actually a demonstration of how moral concepts require contextual interpretation and careful definition. This parallels the difference between primitive biblicism's claim to 'plain reading' and the Church's historic practice of reading Scripture within interpretive traditions."\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 2. In Chapter 10: Christ as Supreme Exemplar\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You could use this contrast to illustrate how Christ exemplifies a complex moral posture that transcends simplistic binaries:\
"Christ's engagement with difference models neither the indifference that Bretherton rightly criticizes as false tolerance nor the dominance that MAGA Christianism often mistakes for strength. Rather, as Bowlin's account of tolerance suggests, Christ demonstrates patient endurance of objectionable difference while maintaining both moral conviction and genuine relationship. This exemplifies what true tolerance looks like when grounded in love\'97not a suspension of judgment but a posture that holds together moral clarity and neighbor love. MAGA Christianism, by contrast, has replaced this complex exemplar with a triumphalist Jesus who conforms more to nationalist ideals than to the cruciform pattern revealed in the gospels."\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 3. In Chapter 15: Fear of the Other vs. Love of Neighbor\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 The Bowlin-Bretherton distinction could help articulate a more nuanced approach to difference:\
"The apparent tension between Bowlin's defense of tolerance and Bretherton's critique reveals an important truth about engaging difference. Both reject what Bowlin calls 'ordinary toleration'\'97mere indifference or grudging endurance. Both affirm that genuine engagement with difference requires active moral agency rather than passive acceptance. This suggests a way beyond MAGA Christianism's fear-based response to difference without surrendering to relativism. True tolerance, like hospitality, recognizes the stranger as bearing the image of God while maintaining moral conviction. Fear drives us to false choices\'97either uncritical embrace or hostile rejection of difference. Love enables the patient endurance that both Bowlin and Bretherton, despite their different vocabularies, recognize as essential to faithful witness."\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 4. In Chapter 16: A Third Way: Christian Humanism\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 This insight could strengthen your case for Christian humanism as an alternative:\
"Christian humanism offers a third way beyond both MAGA Christianism and secular liberalism precisely because it can hold together moral conviction and genuine engagement with difference. This is evident in the complementary insights of Bowlin and Bretherton. While using different terminology\'97tolerance versus hospitality\'97both articulate a vision of human flourishing that requires neither domination nor indifference. Their apparent disagreement reveals not contradiction but a shared commitment to faithful presence in a plural world. Christian humanism rejects both the false tolerance of moral relativism and the false strength of authoritarian domination, offering instead what Bowlin calls 'the patient endurance of objectionable difference' and what Bretherton calls 'hallowing bare life.'"\

\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 5. Methodological Note in the Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 You might also use this insight to establish your methodological approach:\
"This book engages diverse theological voices that sometimes appear to contradict each other\'97from Augustine to Hauerwas, from Bretherton to Bowlin. Rather than assuming contradiction, I explore how apparent tensions often reveal deeper truths. For instance, Bretherton's critique of tolerance in favor of hospitality seems to contradict Bowlin's defense of tolerance as virtue. Yet closer examination reveals they are critiquing and defending different concepts under the same name. This approach models an alternative to MAGA Christianism's tendency to flatten theological complexity into simplistic binaries\'97friend or enemy, faithful or apostate, American or un-American."\
By integrating this insight throughout your book, you demonstrate not just the content of your critique but also model the kind of careful, nuanced theological thinking that stands in contrast to the mutations you identify in MAGA Christianism.\
