# Interindependence and the Virtues: Enriching Our Common Life Politics

Your concept of "interindependence" offers a powerful way to thicken and enrich each of the virtues in your 12-part Common Life Politics essays. Let me explore how this concept might deepen each virtue and enhance our overall understanding of moral life.

## 1. Bullshit (Truth)

**Standard account**: Truth as foundation against deception, emphasizing factual accuracy and honesty.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Truth becomes relational rather than merely propositional. In interindependence, truthfulness isn't just about accurate statements but about creating transparent, authentic relationships where we can truly "see" and be seen by others. When we recognize our interindependence, bullshit becomes not just factually wrong but relationally destructive—it prevents the mutual knowing that freedom requires.

To use your phrase, truth-telling "draws the world around us into God's love" by creating the conditions for genuine relationship. Interindependence helps us understand why truth matters: not just for accurate information but for authentic communion.

## 2. Empathy

**Standard account**: Moral imagination required for community, understanding others' perspectives.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Empathy becomes more than just understanding others—it reveals our participation in one another. Interindependence shows that empathy isn't just projecting ourselves into others' experiences but recognizing how we already participate in them. This transforms empathy from a technique to a recognition of our shared reality.

Interindependence reveals that the boundaries between self and other are permeable, making empathy not just a moral choice but a recognition of ontological reality—we are already "in" each other in profound ways that mirror the Trinity's mutual indwelling.

## 3. Justice

**Standard account**: Justice as the intersection of love, power, and mercy.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Justice becomes the social arrangement that enables mutual flourishing rather than merely fair distribution. In interindependence, just relationships are those where power is shared rather than hoarded, enabling all parties to both give and receive.

This transforms justice from a primarily distributive concept to a participatory one. True justice creates the conditions where all can participate in the mutual indwelling that constitutes genuine freedom. Interindependence reveals why domination is unjust—not just because it harms the dominated but because it prevents the mutual flourishing that defines true freedom for both parties.

## 4. Duty

**Standard account**: Covenant obligations beyond blind obedience.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Duty becomes the faithful response to relationships rather than abstract obligation. Interindependence transforms duty from something we "owe" to something we "live into" through participation in relationships. Our duties flow naturally from our mutual indwelling rather than being imposed externally.

This shifts duty from burden to participatory response—we fulfill our duties not primarily through obligation but through recognition of how we already participate in others' lives. As you might say, living our duties "draws the world around us into God's love" by honoring the relationships that already constitute us.

## 5. Honor

**Standard account**: Integrity as spiritual resistance to corruption.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Honor becomes faithfulness to relationships rather than merely personal integrity. In interindependence, honor means recognizing and respecting how others dwell within us and we within them. This transforms honor from primarily about self-consistency to about faithful presence in relationships.

Interindependence reveals that corruption isn't just personal failing but relational betrayal—it damages the mutual indwelling that constitutes genuine freedom. Honorable action preserves and enhances the quality of our participation in one another.

## 6. Country

**Standard account**: Prophetic patriotism vs. nationalism.

**Thickened by interindependence**: National identity becomes one dimension of interindependence rather than primary loyalty. This transforms patriotism from pride in "our" country to faithful participation in a particular community that remains open to broader human community.

Interindependence reveals why nationalism is problematic—not just because it privileges nation over other goods, but because it fundamentally misunderstands human identity as primarily national rather than relational across boundaries. True patriotism "draws the world around us into God's love" by seeing how our national community participates in broader human community.

## 7. Freedom

**Standard account**: Responsible choice within community.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Freedom becomes mutual flourishing rather than merely individual choice. Interindependence reveals freedom as the capacity to participate fully in relationship rather than merely making unconstrained choices. This transforms freedom from primarily about rights to about relational capacity.

This understanding directly challenges MAGA Christianism's conception of freedom as non-interference, showing how such "freedom" actually diminishes true freedom by isolating individuals from the relationships that enable genuine flourishing. True freedom enhances rather than diminishes others' freedom.

## 8. Love (Part 1)

**Standard account**: Theological foundations of love.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Love becomes participation in divine mutual indwelling rather than merely affection or benevolence. Interindependence reveals love as the practical expression of our participation in trinitarian life. This transforms love from primarily a feeling or choice to a mode of being.

This understanding shows why love is fundamental rather than optional—it's the practical expression of our ontological reality as beings created for mutual indwelling. When we love, we "draw the world around us into God's love" by participating in and extending the trinitarian pattern of mutual indwelling.

## 9. Lament

**Standard account**: Faithful grief as resistance.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Lament becomes shared grieving that honors how others' suffering dwells in us. Interindependence reveals why others' pain is genuinely our pain—not through appropriation but through recognition of our mutual indwelling. This transforms lament from primarily individual expression to communal acknowledgment.

In interindependence, lament isn't just expressing sorrow but creating space for mutual presence in suffering. It resists both false comfort (which denies suffering) and isolated grief (which denies connection). True lament "draws the world around us into God's love" by refusing to abandon relationship in the face of suffering.

## 10. Community

**Standard account**: Building resilient connections against isolation.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Community becomes the visible expression of our ontological reality rather than merely voluntary association. Interindependence reveals community as the natural manifestation of our mutual indwelling rather than something we create. This transforms community from option to necessity for genuine freedom.

This understanding shows why isolation is so damaging—it contradicts our fundamental nature as beings created for mutual indwelling. True community doesn't just alleviate loneliness but enables the mutual flourishing that constitutes genuine freedom.

## 11. Hope

**Standard account**: Vision beyond resistance.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Hope becomes confident expectation of restored mutual indwelling rather than merely optimism about future outcomes. Interindependence reveals what we hope for—not just better circumstances but healed relationships where all can participate fully in mutual flourishing.

This understanding transforms hope from primarily about desired outcomes to about restored relations. Christian hope isn't just that things will improve but that relationships will be healed, enabling the mutual indwelling that constitutes true freedom. Hope "draws the world around us into God's love" by anticipating universal participation in divine life.

## 12. Love (Part 2)

**Standard account**: Love as culminating practice and eschatological vision.

**Thickened by interindependence**: Love becomes the ultimate expression and goal of interindependence. The culmination isn't just that we love each other but that we participate so fully in one another's lives that we mirror the Trinity's mutual indwelling. This transforms love from primarily action to ultimate reality.

Interindependence reveals why love is both means and end—it's both how we participate in divine life now and the fullness of that participation in the eschaton. The vision isn't just of loving relationships but of complete mutual indwelling where "God may be all in all" (1 Cor 15:28).

## Enriching Our Syntopical Analysis

Your concept of interindependence enriches our syntopical analysis of moral life in several ways:

### 1. Integrative Framework

Interindependence provides a unifying framework that shows how these virtues relate to each other. Rather than separate moral qualities, they become different aspects of participating well in mutual indwelling. This creates a more coherent moral vision where virtues reinforce rather than compete with each other.

### 2. Ontological Grounding

Interindependence grounds ethics in ontology—in the way reality is structured rather than merely in rules or principles. This addresses a key weakness in many ethical systems that fail to connect "ought" with "is." If we are fundamentally interindependent beings, virtues become natural expressions of that reality rather than imposed obligations.

### 3. Trinitarian Integration

By connecting human virtues to trinitarian relations, interindependence provides theological depth often missing from virtue ethics. Each virtue becomes not just a human good but a reflection of divine life, giving moral life transcendent significance without disconnecting it from daily reality.

### 4. Response to Contemporary Challenges

Interindependence directly addresses contemporary challenges like isolation, polarization, and environmental crisis by showing how they stem from misunderstanding our fundamental nature. This makes virtue ethics not just personally beneficial but socially transformative.

### 5. Phenomenological Richness

By focusing on how virtues are experienced in relationship, interindependence adds phenomenological richness to our ethical understanding. Virtues become not just abstract qualities but lived experiences of mutual flourishing, making ethics more accessible and compelling.

Your concept of interindependence has the potential to transform our understanding of these virtues from discrete moral qualities to interconnected expressions of our participation in divine life. It "draws the world around us into God's love" by showing how every virtue reflects and extends the mutual indwelling that constitutes both divine and human flourishing.
