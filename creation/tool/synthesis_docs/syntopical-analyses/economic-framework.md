# Economic Framework: Pro-Capitalist Critique of Neoliberalism

This document outlines the economic perspective that informs the book's analysis, drawing on pro-capitalist critics of neoliberalism including David Levy, Luke Bretherton, Wendy Brown, and Quinn Slobodian. This framework provides essential context for understanding how economic ideologies interact with religious and political movements in MAGA Christianism.

## Core Economic Critique

### Understanding Neoliberalism
Neoliberalism represents not simply free markets, but a specific economic-political project characterized by:

- **Market Fundamentalism**: The extension of market logic and metrics to all domains of life
- **Economization of the Political**: Recasting political problems as market problems
- **Dissolution of Democratic Constraints**: The systematic weakening of democratic controls over market forces
- **Elevation of Economic Liberty**: Prioritizing economic freedom over other forms of freedom
- **Global Governance Structures**: Creation of supranational institutions that insulate markets from democratic accountability

### Pro-Capitalist Alternative
The critique offered is not anti-market but rather envisions markets properly embedded within:

- **Democratic Governance**: Markets constrained by and accountable to democratic processes
- **Moral Frameworks**: Economic activity guided by substantive moral considerations beyond efficiency
- **Social Bonds**: Recognition that markets depend upon pre-market social relationships and moral norms
- **Political Deliberation**: Economic policies subject to robust public deliberation rather than technocratic management
- **National Sovereignty**: Economic decisions balanced with considerations of national self-determination

## Theoretical Influences

### Wendy Brown
- Analysis of neoliberalism as a governing rationality that extends beyond economic policy
- Critique of how neoliberalism hollows out democracy by recasting citizens as entrepreneurs
- Recognition that neoliberalism transforms all aspects of life according to market metrics
- Identification of how neoliberal logic undermines the very political conditions markets require

### Quinn Slobodian
- Historical analysis of how neoliberals sought to create global institutions to protect markets from democratic demands
- Distinction between actual free markets and neoliberal governance structures
- Recognition that neoliberalism represents a specific political project rather than simply "free markets"
- Critique of how neoliberal institutions prioritize investor rights over democratic sovereignty

### David Levy
- Articulation of how markets can serve human flourishing when properly constrained
- Critique of concentrated economic power as a threat to both democracy and market function
- Emphasis on how monopolistic tendencies distort both political and economic processes
- Recognition that healthy markets require robust civic and political institutions

### Luke Bretherton
- Theological critique of market absolutism as a form of idolatry
- Recognition that markets depend upon non-market values and institutions
- Emphasis on how democratic politics can constrain economic power
- Vision of markets as one domain of human flourishing rather than the template for all human relations

## Economic Dimensions of MAGA Christianism

### Contradictions and Tensions
- Simultaneous embrace of pro-business rhetoric and economic nationalism
- Tension between populist economic messaging and plutocratic policy outcomes
- Selective critique of global economic institutions alongside defense of domestic concentrations of wealth
- Inconsistent application of "free market" principles depending on constituency interests

### Religious-Economic Fusion
- How prosperity gospel theology provides religious legitimation for particular economic arrangements
- The way Christian nationalism frequently aligns with economic nationalism
- Tensions between communitarian religious rhetoric and individualistic economic policies
- How theological language about blessing and covenant gets mapped onto economic outcomes

### Alternative Vision
- Articulation of markets properly embedded in democratic processes and moral frameworks
- Vision of economic activity serving common good rather than replacing it
- Recognition of legitimate role for both market and non-market solutions
- Economic nationalism balanced with international cooperation and global justice concerns
- Religious values informing economic policies without being reduced to market logic

## Practical Implications

### Policy Considerations
- Markets regulated to prevent monopolistic concentration
- Labor rights and dignity balanced with business interests
- Environmental stewardship integrated with economic development
- Social safety nets compatible with market incentives
- Democratic oversight of economic institutions

### Religious-Economic Integration
- Theological resources for critiquing both state and market absolutism
- Religious communities as spaces for economic mutualism and cooperation
- Faith traditions providing moral frameworks for economic activity
- Ecclesial practices modeling alternatives to pure market rationality
