# Against Christian Nationalism

## 90-Second Video Script

Christian nationalism has emerged as one of the most dangerous distortions of our faith in America today. As someone who grew up in the segregated South and now serves on the Episcopal Church's Theology Committee, I've witnessed its evolution firsthand.

What makes Christian nationalism so insidious is not its patriotism but its idolatry. It doesn't simply love America—it baptizes American power and privilege in Christian language while divorcing that language from its actual theological content.

When the cross appears alongside the American flag, we're not seeing Christianity enhancing patriotism but something altogether different—a nationalist movement clothed in religious symbolism to escape moral scrutiny.

The theological error here isn't subtle. Christian nationalism fails to grasp that our primary citizenship as Christians is in God's kingdom, which transcends and judges all earthly powers. It confuses a particular arrangement of American power—typically one that privileges white Protestant cultural dominance—with divine will.

Many of my fellow academy graduates are drawn to Christian nationalism because it promises simple answers to complex challenges. But our military oath was to the Constitution, not to any particular vision of Christian America.

True Christian witness in public life begins not with securing power but with truthful confession about our complicity in systems of domination. It demands formation by worship practices that reshape our imagination beyond national identity toward the beloved community that crosses all borders.

What America needs isn't Christian nationalism but Christians committed to truthful witness that holds all nations, including our own, accountable to God's justice and mercy.

### Idolatry in Red, White, and Blue: A Theological Response to Christian Nationalism

Christian nationalism has emerged as one of the most dangerous distortions of our faith in America today. As someone who grew up in segregated Baton Rouge and now serves on the Episcopal Church's Theology Committee—where I co-authored a book addressing this very phenomenon—I've witnessed its evolution from the thinly veiled racism of my youth to its current manifestation in MAGA Christianism.

What makes Christian nationalism so insidious is not its patriotism but its idolatry. It doesn't simply love America—it baptizes American power and privilege in Christian language while divorcing that language from its actual theological content. The result isn't Christianity influencing politics but politics reshaping Christianity into something unrecognizable to the church through history.

When we examine Christian nationalism through trinitarian theology, its fundamental error becomes clear. The doctrine of the Trinity reveals God as a communion of persons whose very nature is self-giving love. This trinitarian understanding of God fundamentally contradicts nationalism's assertion of exclusive identity and self-interested power. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection manifest God's rejection of domination in all forms, while Christian nationalism seeks to secure domination for a particular vision of America.

Many of my fellow Naval Academy graduates and veterans are drawn to Christian nationalism because it promises simple answers to our nation's complex challenges. It wraps itself in symbols we were trained to revere and appeals to our desire for clarity and mission. But we must remember that our military oath was to the Constitution, not to any particular vision of Christian America. That Constitution explicitly rejects religious tests for office and prohibits establishment of religion.

The biblical narrative, when read through the lens of Christ rather than through the distortions of fundamentalist biblicism, consistently challenges the identification of God's purposes with any nation's agenda. The prophets confronted Israel's leadership when they confused national interest with divine will. Jesus himself rejected nationalist messianic expectations in favor of a kingdom not defined by borders or military might.

Richard Hooker, facing similar challenges in Elizabethan England, recognized that political theology must be grounded in rigorous trinitarian thinking rather than simplistic appeals to Scripture divorced from its proper context. Like Hooker, we must recover theological reasoning that begins with God's nature rather than with nationalist identity or market logic.

My own journey from Louisiana during desegregation to the Naval Academy to theological study has shown me how Christian symbols can be weaponized to defend unjust power arrangements. My ancestors owned plantations near Lecompte, Louisiana, and claimed to be Christian while participating in chattel slavery. Today's Christian nationalism follows a similar pattern, using Christian language to sanctify systems that maintain white hegemony while denying doing exactly that.

In our worship as Episcopalians, we practice a different understanding of citizenship. The Eucharist forms us as a community where national identity is secondary to our baptismal identity in Christ. We confess our sins—personal and corporate—rather than proclaiming national innocence. We pray for all nations, not claiming God exclusively for America. This liturgical formation isn't separate from political witness but fundamentally shapes it.

Christian nationalism's most pernicious theological error is its understanding of freedom. It champions "freedom" as non-interference for the privileged while accepting—even championing—domination of others. This fundamentally contradicts both the freedom proclaimed in the Gospel and the civic republican tradition that shaped our nation's founding before being corrupted by white supremacy.

For my fellow academy graduates who value duty and sacrifice, I offer this challenge: True patriotism doesn't mean sanctifying America's past or present but working toward a society where freedom as non-domination is available to all. It means confronting how Christian symbols have been co-opted to defend hierarchies that Christ came to overturn. It requires the moral courage to distinguish between love of country and idolatry of power.

The church's role isn't to secure Christian power in society but to form Christians who can offer truthful witness about both sin and grace. When the church becomes a chaplain to nationalism, it loses its prophetic voice and betrays its Lord, who came not to be served but to serve.

What America needs isn't Christian nationalism but Christians committed to truthful witness that holds all nations, including our own, accountable to God's justice and mercy. We need communities formed by worship that expands our moral imagination beyond national borders toward the beloved community that transcends them.

This witness begins not with securing power but with truthful confession about our complicity in systems of domination. It continues through practices of repentance and reconciliation that model a different way of being in the world. And it offers not domination but invitation—to a table where all are welcome because all bear God's image, regardless of nationality, race, or status.
