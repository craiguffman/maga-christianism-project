Interdependence

You're right - we should integrate this concept into our existing work rather than starting over. Let me take our current Freedom essay and enhance it with interindependence while preserving the core structure and insights we've already developed.

# Freedom: Responsible Choice Within Community, Reimagined as Interindependence

Freedom stands at the center of American identity. We fight wars in its name, structure our economy around it, and invoke it in nearly every political debate. Yet the nature of freedom remains deeply contested. Is freedom primarily about individual autonomy—the absence of external constraints? Or does true freedom require participation in community—the capacity to contribute to collective flourishing?

In this essay, I want to propose that authentic freedom is best understood as **interindependence**—the mutual indwelling of distinct persons who find their true identity neither through independence from nor absorption into others, but through reciprocal giving and receiving that draws the world around us into God's love. This concept, which I first encountered through my counselor, Chris Charleton of InterAct Counseling in Rochester, NY, illuminates how freedom emerges not from isolation but from the capacity for mutual recognition and flourishing.

## Beyond Non-Interference: Freedom as Non-Domination

The dominant understanding of freedom in American culture is "negative liberty"—freedom as non-interference or the absence of external constraints. This view, articulated most clearly by philosopher Isaiah Berlin, defines freedom primarily by what's absent: coercion, restriction, or obstruction.

But as philosopher Philip Pettit argues, negative liberty proves insufficient. A person might be free from interference yet still dominated if others hold arbitrary power over them. The slave whose master happens to be benevolent still lacks freedom because their status depends entirely on the master's whim. True freedom requires not just non-interference but non-domination—the absence of arbitrary power that could interfere at will.

Pettit's conception moves us beyond mere autonomy toward a more relational understanding of freedom. Freedom as non-domination requires social and political arrangements where power is constrained by accountability. It calls for institutions and communities where all have voice and no one exercises arbitrary control.

## Freedom as Interindependence: A Theological Framework

Interindependence deepens Pettit's insight by showing how freedom emerges through relationship rather than despite it. Where negative liberty sees relationships primarily as potential constraints, interindependence recognizes them as the very context in which freedom becomes possible.

This understanding has deep theological roots. The Trinity reveals God's nature as mutual indwelling without domination. Father, Son, and Spirit maintain their distinctiveness precisely through their perfect communion. Each divine person "makes space" for the others in a relationship of complete self-giving love without absorption or control.

Through Christ, we're invited to participate in this divine communion. As theologian Rowan Williams suggests, salvation isn't primarily about securing benefits for autonomous individuals but about being drawn into the mutual indwelling of Father, Son, and Spirit. We become most distinctively ourselves precisely as we participate in relationships of self-giving love.

The Holy Spirit then creates communities where this interindependence becomes possible among humans. As Campbell, Wells, and Bretherton might all emphasize in their distinct ways, the church at its best manifests a community where freedom emerges through mutual recognition and love rather than through isolation or domination.

## Freedom as Capacity for Love

Understanding freedom as interindependence reveals it as fundamentally the capacity to love in such a way that we draw the world around us into God's love. This isn't a sentimental notion but a profound reframing of both personal agency and social obligation.

Freedom isn't primarily about maximizing choices but about developing the capacity for right relationship. The addict may have the "choice" to consume their substance, but this doesn't represent freedom—it represents bondage to a desire that diminishes rather than enhances their capacity for relationship.

Similarly, the billionaire whose wealth shields them from accountability doesn't represent the pinnacle of freedom but its distortion. Their capacity to act without constraint often diminishes their capacity for authentic relationship, leaving them isolated despite their power.

True freedom manifests in the capacity to recognize others as distinct persons worthy of love—neither as extensions of ourselves nor as obstacles to our will. It's found in relationships where we neither dominate nor are dominated, but participate in mutual flourishing.

## Political Implications: Beyond Individualism and Collectivism

Freedom as interindependence challenges both liberal individualism and collectivist absorption. It seeks political arrangements that preserve distinctiveness while fostering mutual accountability and flourishing.

Against market fundamentalism, it insists that freedom requires more than consumer choice or contractual arrangements. Markets serve freedom only when embedded in communities with shared moral commitments beyond profit maximization.

Against state collectivism, it resists absorption of individual and community distinctiveness into centralized power. It seeks subsidiarity—decisions made at the most local level possible—while maintaining commitment to the common good.

This view supports arrangements where communities maintain their particularity while forming relationships of mutual accountability across differences. It seeks governance structures where power flows from the consent of the governed and remains accountable to their flourishing.

## MAGA Christianism's Distorted Freedom

MAGA Christianism fundamentally distorts this understanding of freedom. By fusing Christian symbols with nationalist identity, it substitutes cultural dominance for self-giving love. It mistakes the capacity to impose one's will without opposition for authentic freedom.

This movement often celebrates freedom as the absence of constraint—whether from government regulation, cultural critique, or accountability to global community. Yet it simultaneously seeks to constrain the freedom of those deemed outside its narrow definition of authentic American identity.

This contradiction reveals that MAGA Christianism doesn't truly value freedom as non-domination or interindependence. It values power—the capacity to shape society according to particular cultural preferences without accountability to those harmed by this vision.

Against this distortion, freedom as interindependence insists that Christian freedom means capacity for relationship, not immunity from constraint or accountability. It recognizes that freedom flourishes not through cultural dominance but through communities of mutual recognition and love.

## Conclusion: Freedom for Relationship

Freedom understood as interindependence emerges not through isolation but through reciprocal relationship. It manifests in communities where we maintain our distinctiveness while participating in bonds of mutual giving and receiving.

This vision challenges us to build institutions and communities where power serves relationship rather than domination, where diversity enriches rather than threatens, and where freedom means capacity to love rather than immunity from constraint.

As we face challenges from climate change to technological disruption to political polarization, we need a robust conception of freedom that can sustain communities of mutual flourishing. Freedom as interindependence—as the capacity to love in ways that draw the world around us into God's love—offers precisely this vision.
