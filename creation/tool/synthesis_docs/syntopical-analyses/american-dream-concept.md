# The American Dream vs. MAGA Christianism

This document outlines a conception of the American Dream informed by Lincoln, Smith, Baldwin, Rorty, and Churchwell, contrasting it with the vision presented in MAGA Christianism. This framework provides an essential lens for understanding competing narratives about American identity and purpose.

## The American Dream: A Progressive Patriotic Vision

### Philosophical Foundations

The American Dream represents an aspiration that combines both individual opportunity and collective moral progress. This conception draws from:

- **Lincoln's Unfinished Work**: America as an ongoing project dedicated to the proposition that all are created equal
- **Smith's Multiple Traditions**: Recognition of competing civic, liberal, and ascriptive traditions in American identity
- **Baldwin's Moral Challenge**: America's obligation to live up to its professed ideals
- **Rorty's Pragmatic Hope**: The possibility of creating a more just and inclusive national community
- **Churchwell's Historical Analysis**: The contested meanings of the American Dream throughout history

### Core Elements

#### Universal Aspiration with Particular Roots
- Acknowledges America's specific historical and cultural context
- Extends promise of liberty and equality beyond original boundaries
- Recognizes tension between universal values and particular national identity
- Embraces cultural plurality while maintaining civic unity

#### Dynamic Relationship with the Past
- Views American history as morally complex rather than uniformly heroic or villainous
- Acknowledges profound injustices without abandoning hope in founding principles
- Uses founding ideals as leverage for critique and reform
- Sees American identity as evolving rather than fixed in the past

#### Economic Opportunity with Moral Purpose
- Balances individual economic freedom with common good
- Recognizes need for both opportunity and basic security
- Views prosperity as means to enable human flourishing
- Understands economic arrangements as subject to democratic deliberation

#### Progressive Patriotism
- Loves country enough to hold it accountable to its highest ideals
- Embraces critique as form of patriotic engagement
- Seeks to expand liberty and equality to all citizens
- Balances national pride with honest reckoning with failures

#### Democratic Process
- Values democratic participation as both means and end
- Emphasizes persuasion over coercion
- Commits to fair procedures and institutional integrity
- Balances majority rule with minority rights

## MAGA Christianism's Counter-Narrative

### Philosophical Foundations

MAGA Christianism presents an alternative vision that draws from:

- **Ascriptive Americanism**: Privileging certain racial, religious, and cultural identities as authentically American
- **Christian Nationalism**: Fusion of Christian and American identities
- **Restorationist Nostalgia**: Idealization of an earlier period of American history
- **Apocalyptic Framing**: Viewing contemporary America as in terminal decline without radical intervention
- **Providential Exceptionalism**: America as uniquely blessed nation with divine mandate

### Core Elements

#### Exclusive Americanism
- Defines authentic American identity primarily through particular religious, racial, and cultural markers
- Treats some citizens as more genuinely American than others
- Views demographic and cultural change as threat to national identity
- Conflates Christian identity with American identity

#### Static Relationship with the Past
- Idealizes selective aspects of American history
- Resists critical engagement with historical injustices
- Frames contemporary challenges as deviation from historical greatness
- Seeks restoration rather than progress

#### Economic Nationalism with Moral Traditionalism
- Combines free market rhetoric with protectionist policies
- Emphasizes national economic interests over global concerns
- Often subordinates economic questions to cultural grievances
- Links economic success to moral deservingness

#### Defensive Patriotism
- Interprets criticism of America as disloyalty
- Emphasizes external threats and internal enemies
- Presents patriotism primarily as defense against perceived attacks
- Measures love of country by symbolic displays rather than critical engagement

#### Majoritarian Authoritarianism
- Values electoral victory over democratic norms and procedures
- Willing to restrict democratic participation to ensure desired outcomes
- Prioritizes cultural dominance over pluralistic accommodation
- Justifies institutional manipulation for partisan advantage

## Competing Narratives of American Identity

### The Dream's Progressive Arc
- America as fundamentally defined by its aspirational principles
- National identity as continually expanding circle of inclusion
- American exceptionalism as special responsibility rather than special entitlement

### MAGA Christianism's Restoration Project
- America as fundamentally defined by particular cultural and religious heritage
- National identity as defense against dilution by foreign influences
- American exceptionalism as special blessing requiring cultural and religious purity
