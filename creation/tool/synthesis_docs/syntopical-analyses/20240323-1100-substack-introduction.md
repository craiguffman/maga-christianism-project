# Participatory Freedom: A New Direction for Common Life Politics

Dear friends and fellow travelers,

When I began Common Life Politics, I framed our central question as "How do we love our neighbor well?" That question—with its dimensions of responding to the vulnerable, building shared life with the unfamiliar, and stewarding power effectively—remains at the heart of everything we do here.

But as our national conversation has evolved, so too must our approach. Today, I'm excited to share how Common Life Politics is expanding into five interconnected series, all illuminated by what I've come to call "Participatory Freedom Theology"—a framework that integrates theological insight, political theory, and lived experience.

## The Challenge Before Us

America stands at a crossroads where religious faith has fused with political identity in ways that demand theological analysis, not merely political commentary. What I've termed "MAGA Christianism" represents not simply a political alignment but a profound theological mutation characterized by seven distortions of Christian tradition:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Hermeneutical Reductionism**: Reduces scriptural complexity to simple rules and binary distinctions
3. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar while maintaining Christian identity markers
4. **Transactional Soteriology**: Replaces participatory salvation with contractual frameworks
5. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Divides the world into absolute categories of good and evil
6. **Dominion Theology**: Reframes Christian mission as cultural and political dominance
7. **Epistemological Tribalism**: Makes group identity rather than evidence the arbiter of truth

These mutations co-articulate to create a worldview where freedom is misunderstood as either non-interference (the libertarian view) or submission to authority (the authoritarian view)—both fundamentally at odds with the Christian understanding of freedom as participation in divine life.

## Participatory Freedom Theology

In response, I've been developing what I call "Participatory Freedom Theology"—a framework that draws on Douglas Campbell's critique of Justification Theory, Samuel Wells' incarnational "being with," and Philip Pettit's freedom as non-domination.

This approach understands freedom not as absence of constraint but as participation in communities—divine and human—characterized by love without domination. It sees the Trinity as the model of perfect freedom: distinct persons fully participating in one another's life without domination or subordination. And it recognizes Jesus's resurrection as the means by which we participate in this divine freedom.

Participatory Freedom Theology offers a constructive alternative to MAGA Christianism's mutations:

- Where they claim unmediated biblical access, we practice participatory interpretation
- Where they reduce scripture to rules, we embrace its complexity as invitation to participation
- Where they remove Jesus as exemplar, we center participation in Christ's life
- Where they offer contractual salvation, we embrace participation in resurrection life
- Where they divide the world into binary categories, we envision reconciled communities
- Where they seek cultural dominance, we invite participation across difference
- Where they make tribal identity the arbiter of truth, we practice communal discernment

This theological vision will inform all aspects of Common Life Politics moving forward.

## Five Pathways of Exploration

Starting next week, Common Life Politics will offer content five days a week, following distinct but complementary paths:

### Mondays: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters
I'll share sequential chapters analyzing how MAGA Christianism's seven theological mutations transform Christian language into political tools, with each chapter offering a constructive alternative through Participatory Freedom Theology.

### Tuesdays: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays
These essays will connect my personal journey through recovery, health transformation, and connection to the land with our broader theological vision. Working from the conviction that participation in creation's processes illuminates participation in divine life, these reflections explore how tending the soil parallels tending the soul.

### Wednesdays: 12-Part Series
I'll continue the two successive 12-part series that many of you have already been following. While these were drafted before I fully articulated Participatory Freedom Theology, you'll notice how they explore themes of covenant relationship, truthfulness, love, and freedom that provide foundation for understanding participation without domination. These Wednesday series will also be published as Kindle ebooks, allowing broader distribution of these foundational ideas.

### Thursdays: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals
These posts will share my personal journey of discovering how American history contains both systems of domination and movements toward genuine participation. These confessional essays weave together historical research and my own awakening from the "Lost Cause" mythology I was taught in segregated Baton Rouge.

### Fridays: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces
Sometimes truth emerges most clearly through irony. Friday posts will offer satirical pieces that contrast dominative frameworks with participatory alternatives, employing a visual style reminiscent of official government documents to highlight the gap between stated values and actual practices.

## A Coherent Vision

While these five series maintain distinct identities, they represent a unified response illuminated by Participatory Freedom Theology:

- The **analytical** identifies theological mutations and their political consequences
- The **personal** explores embodied participation in divine and natural processes
- The **foundational** establishes core principles through our ongoing Wednesday series
- The **historical** recovers both domination and participation in American experience
- The **satirical** exposes contradictions between dominative claims and participatory ideals

Together, they offer a vision of faith deeply rooted in tradition while reaching toward more just and reconciled forms of common life.

## Our Continuing Covenant

The expansion of content doesn't change our fundamental relationship. I remain committed to the garden metaphor I shared when we began: this space is always a work in progress, never complete or authoritative, but continuously growing and evolving. I reserve the right to be wrong or insufficient, but I will keep learning and correcting things as I understand them better.

I still ask readers to allow me to be wrong, offer and receive constructive criticism, and attribute my work. I promise to be considerate of visitors, offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to feedback. This covenant remains the basis of our relationship as we expand our exploration.

## What This Means for Subscribers

Paid subscribers will receive all five weekly posts, plus access to:
- The Christian Humanist newsletter and podcast
- The Race on the Rocks newsletter and podcast

## What's Coming Next Week

I hope you'll join me on this expanded journey as we explore how participation in divine life transforms our understanding of freedom and shapes how we love our neighbors in this complex and challenging moment.

With gratitude for your companionship on this path,

Craig Geevarghese-Uffman, Ph.D.
