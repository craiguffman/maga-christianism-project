# Slobodian's Insights on Capitalism Without Democracy
## Notes for MAGA Christianism Book Project

These notes synthesize key insights from Quinn Slobodian's books "Crack-Up Capitalism" and "Globalists" that help explain the rise of Trumpian populism, MAGA Christianism, and the broader trend of capitalism without democratic accountability.

## 1. The Tension Between Capitalism and Democracy

A central theme in Slobodian's work is that neoliberals and libertarians have long understood that capitalism and democracy might be fundamentally incompatible:

- **Capitalism Without Democracy**: Many neoliberal thinkers believed that "capitalism can exist without democracy" and that "democracy as it has grown up in Western societies may be inimical to the growth and maintenance of markets."

- **Direct Statements**: Stephen Moore (Heritage Foundation): "Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy. I'm not even a big believer in democracy."

- **Constrained Democracy**: Neoliberals advocated for what Slobodian calls "constrained democracy" - limiting democratic powers to prevent redistribution of wealth or interference with markets.

## 2. Zones and Enclaves as Economic Experiments

Slobodian's concept of "crack-up capitalism" describes how special economic zones have become laboratories for capitalism without democratic constraints:

- **Proliferation**: "There are over 5,400 zones in the world... One thousand new zones have appeared in the last decade alone."

- **Tax Havens**: "The flight of corporate profits to these low- or zero-tax jurisdictions costs the United States alone $70 billion a year in tax revenue."

- **Parallel Legal Systems**: Zones often operate with different legal frameworks that privilege capital over democratic oversight.

## 3. The Alliance Between Market Radicals and Cultural Conservatives

This alliance helps explain MAGA Christianism as a political phenomenon:

- **The "Paleo Alliance"**: In the 1990s, "market radicals seeking passage to a capitalist polity beyond democracy and neo-Confederates seeking to resurrect the Old South" formed an alliance combining "principles of decentralized capitalist competition and racial homogeneity."

- **Paleo-libertarianism**: Developed by Murray Rothbard and Lew Rockwell, it sought to "hive off" the "hippies, druggies, and militantly anti-Christian atheists" from libertarianism to focus on "Judeo-Christian traditions and Western culture."

- **Strategic Coalition**: Cultural conservatism serves as a vehicle for advancing anti-democratic economic policies by appealing to voters' cultural anxieties while implementing policies that primarily benefit economic elites.

## 4. The Fear of Redistribution

A driving force behind the push for capitalism without democratic constraints:

- **Protecting Capital**: Neoliberals designed institutions "not to liberate markets but to encase them, to inoculate capitalism against the threat of democracy."

- **Perceived Threats**: The expansion of democratic participation globally through decolonization and civil rights movements increased pressure for redistributive policies.

- **Institutional Design**: Creating frameworks that place capital rights beyond democratic reach became a primary goal.

## 5. Technology and Exit

Technology has enabled new forms of "exit" from democratic oversight:

- **Digital Exit**: Balaji Srinivasan's concept of the "cloud country" represents a technological version of exit from democratic accountability.

- **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital currencies offer ways to bypass national taxation and regulation, providing a modern version of what earlier neoliberals called "cybercash" that would "starve the welfare state."

## 6. Implications for Understanding MAGA Christianism

- **The Religious-Capitalist Alliance**: MAGA Christianism represents the contemporary manifestation of the "paleo alliance" - combining religious traditionalism with market fundamentalism.

- **The Paradox of Populism**: Right-wing populism claims to represent "the people" against "elites" while implementing policies that benefit economic elites - a contradiction explained by the alliance between cultural conservatives and market radicals.

- **Racial and Cultural Anxiety**: The appeal to racial and cultural anxiety serves as a powerful mobilizing force for policies that primarily benefit capital.

- **Voluntary Segregation**: The libertarian vision of "voluntary" racial and cultural sorting through market mechanisms provides intellectual cover for exclusionary practices.

## 7. Key Quotes for Potential Use in MAGA Christianism Book

- "Champions of perforation cast themselves melodramatically as guerrillas of the Right, reclaiming—and decomposing—the nation-state, zone by zone."

- "For libertarians, the foremost attraction [of Orania] is its structure as a private entity. Orania's leader is the chief executive, and residents are shareholders in the mother company."

- "According to the libertarian model, racial separation and racial inequality created by the push and pull of economic forces posed no threat to the principles of the free market."

- "The libertarian Bantustan was not an expression of the popular longing of the South African people. It was not a lever to weaken the grip of the apartheid state. Rather, it served a role in the strategy of the apartheid state and it needed the apartheid state to live. Libertarians were not brave resisters. They were the useful idiots of the government in Pretoria."

- "The doubled world of modern capitalism coalesced in the nineteenth century... the division between dominium and imperium was more fundamental than the purely political distinction of foreign and domestic."
