## Key Connections and Syntheses

### Freedom as Non-Domination and Participation in Christ
Campbell's participatory soteriology provides theological foundation for Pettit's freedom as non-domination. Both emphasize relationship over contract, community over individualism, and participation over transaction. This participatory framework offers theological critique of both economic libertarianism and political authoritarianism in MAGA Christianism.

### Neoliberalism and Practical Atheism
The financialization and abstraction characteristic of neoliberalism parallels the practical atheism identified in MAGA Christianism. Both disconnect practice from theological foundation, replacing participatory relationship with transactional exchange. This connection helps explain how MAGA Christianism can emerge from neoliberal social conditions while superficially opposing them.

### Binary Apocalypticism and Economic Precarity
The binary apocalyptic thinking in MAGA Christianism connects to experiences of economic precarity under financialized capitalism. The economic volatility, social dislocation, and uncertain future created by neoliberal arrangements generate apocalyptic imagination that divides world into absolute good and evil. This illuminates how economic conditions shape theological imagination.

### Crack-Up Capitalism and Anti-Commonwealth
The emerging "crack-up capitalism" with competing oligarchic power centers represents theological anti-commonwealth - the opposite of what Bretherton calls "complex space." Where theological vision emphasizes institutional plurality oriented toward common good, crack-up capitalism creates competing fiefdoms without accountability. This reveals theological dimensions of contemporary economic fragmentation.

### From Plantation to Platform: Historical Continuity of Dominance
The connection between Barbadian plantation capitalism, King Cotton oligarchy, and contemporary tech oligarchy reveals a historical continuity of dominative systems in American life. All three combine hierarchical economic arrangements with theological justifications and cross-class coalitions. MAGA Christianism represents not merely a reaction to recent changes but a restorationist project seeking to rebuild elements of these historical systems of dominance.
