# Mark Atomic Essay Creation Prompt Template

## Purpose
This prompt template transforms insights from Mark's Gospel into concise, powerful 90-second "atomic essays" that embody Mark's subversive challenge to worldly power structures. These essays provide daily inspiration that encourages faithful resistance to distorted theology while subtly subverting MAGA Christianism's narrative.

## Storage Location
All atomic essay scripts should be stored in the following directory structure:
- `/Users/craiguffman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/Mac/Documents/GitHub/maga-christianism-project/content/social/atomic/mark/[passage-reference]-[key-concept].md`

## Prompt Template

```
I need you to create a subversively inspiring 90-second atomic essay from Mark's Gospel for social media:

Source Passage: [MARK_PASSAGE]
Inspirational Focus: [SINGLE_CONCEPT_FOCUS]
Target Platform: [FACEBOOK_REELS/YOUTUBE_SHORTS/INSTAGRAM_REELS]
Specific Encouragement Needed: [COURAGE/PERSEVERANCE/HOPE/CLARITY/COMMUNITY]
MAGA Narrative Being Subverted: [SPECIFIC_NARRATIVE]

Please create a markdown artifact with the file path at the very top of the document:

/Users/craiguffman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/Mac/Documents/GitHub/maga-christianism-project/content/social/atomic/mark/[passage-reference]-[key-concept].md

Then create an atomic essay with these components:

# [COMPELLING_TITLE]: A [PLATFORM] Atomic Essay
**Word Count:** [ACTUAL_WORD_COUNT]
**Video Length:** Approximately 90 seconds

---

[ATOMIC_ESSAY_TEXT_WITH_VIDEO_FORMATTING]

The atomic essay should include:

1. **Emotional Hook** (10 seconds): A direct, heartfelt statement speaking to those caught in distorted religious narratives
2. **Gospel Subversion** (25 seconds): How Jesus's words/actions in this passage challenged the power structures of his day
3. **Counter-Imperial Hope** (35 seconds): How this truth empowers resistance to today's religious-political distortions
4. **Courage Call** (20 seconds): A specific encouragement that builds resilience through subversive faithfulness

Video formatting instructions:
- Use [PAUSE Xs] to indicate brief pauses (typically 0.5-1 seconds)
- Use [EMPHASIZE] for words that should receive vocal emphasis
- Format for warm, pastoral delivery with prophetic undertones
- Use direct "you" statements that speak to viewers' hearts
- Employ the subtle subversion of Mark's narrative style
- Keep total word count under 150 words for approximately 90 seconds
```

## Implementation Notes
- Remember that Mark's Gospel was written during Roman occupation to subvert imperial theology
- Draw parallels between Roman imperial cult and modern religious nationalism without explicit references
- Use Jesus's boundary-crossing, hierarchy-challenging actions as models for today
- Employ the same subtle subversion techniques Mark used: implication rather than declaration
- Never explicitly name MAGA Christianism, but subvert its core theological claims
- Structure each essay as a miniature counter-narrative to dominant religious-political messaging

## Subversion Strategy
- Redefine key terms that have been co-opted (freedom, authority, power, truth)
- Challenge hierarchies of human value without naming specific political policies
- Restore Jesus's solidarity with marginalized people as central to the gospel
- Emphasize how Jesus consistently violated religious-political boundaries
- Present the Way of Love as inherently subversive to systems of domination

## Example Applications
- Mark 1:21-28 (Jesus confronts an unclean spirit): Subvert narratives about "spiritual warfare" that demonize political opponents
- Mark 2:13-17 (Jesus eats with tax collectors): Subvert narratives about "moral purity" that exclude marginalized communities
- Mark 3:1-6 (Sabbath healing): Subvert narratives about religious tradition that prioritize rules over human flourishing
- Mark 5:1-20 (Gerasene demoniac): Subvert narratives about national boundaries and who belongs in the community
