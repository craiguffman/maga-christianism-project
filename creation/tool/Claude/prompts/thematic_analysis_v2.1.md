# Thematic Analysis Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt template is designed to synthesize insights across multiple source analyses into cohesive thematic analyses that can inform chapters, lexicon entries, and publication streams.

## Storage Location
All thematic analyses should be stored in the following directory structure:
- `/Users/craiguffman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/Mac/Documents/GitHub/maga-christianism-project/research/themes/[theme-category]/[specific-theme].md`

Where [theme-category] is one of:
- mutations (theological mutations)
- frameworks (theoretical frameworks)
- counterpoints (constructive alternatives)
- historical (historical patterns)
- contemporary (contemporary manifestations)

## Prompt Template

```
I need you to create a thematic analysis synthesizing insights across multiple source analyses for my MAGA Christianism and Untold America projects:

Theme: [THEME_NAME]
Theme Category: [CATEGORY]
Related Sources:
- [SOURCE_1]
- [SOURCE_2]
- [SOURCE_3]

Please create a comprehensive markdown artifact with these components:
