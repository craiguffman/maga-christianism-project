# Podcast Audio Selection Tool

## Purpose
This tool guides you through selecting and preparing optimal audio segments from your existing podcast files to train Descript's voice clone feature, resulting in a natural-sounding AI voice that captures your authentic speaking style.

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Audio Assessment

Evaluate your existing podcast episodes using these criteria:

**Audio Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear voice recording without significant background noise
- [ ] Minimal room echo/reverb
- [ ] No music or sound effects overlapping with speech
- [ ] Consistent audio levels without clipping
- [ ] Single-speaker segments (your voice only)
- [ ] High fidelity recording (ideally 44.1kHz, 16-bit or higher)

**Content Variety Checklist:**
- [ ] Includes declarative statements
- [ ] Includes questions with natural inflection
- [ ] Contains emotional variation (enthusiasm, thoughtfulness, etc.)
- [ ] Features both quick and measured speaking paces
- [ ] Contains domain-specific vocabulary you'll need in your homilies
- [ ] Demonstrates natural transitions between thoughts

### Step 2: Episode Selection

1. **Identify 3-5 Strong Episodes**
   - Choose episodes where you spoke clearly and naturally
   - Select episodes covering topics similar to your planned homilies
   - Prioritize recent recordings that represent your current voice
   - Focus on conversational episodes rather than scripted ones

2. **Document Selected Episodes**

| Episode | Topic | Recording Date | Audio Quality | Notable Segments | Time Codes |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Ep. XX  |       |                |               |                  |            |
| Ep. XX  |       |                |               |                  |            |
| Ep. XX  |       |                |               |                  |            |

### Step 3: Segment Extraction

For each selected episode, extract 5-8 minute segments using these guidelines:

1. **Open each episode in your audio editing software** (Descript, Audacity, etc.)

2. **Identify optimal segments** meeting these criteria:
   - Your continuous speech without interruptions
   - Clean audio quality (use visualizers to identify consistent waveforms)
   - Natural speaking rhythm (not rushed or artificially slow)
   - Varied sentence structures and intonations
   - No background music or effects

3. **Mark segment boundaries** at natural pauses

4. **Extract each segment** as a separate WAV file using these settings:
   - Format: WAV (uncompressed)
   - Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
   - Bit Depth: 16-bit or higher
   - Channel: Mono (if your voice is isolated to one channel)

5. **Name files systematically**
   - Format: `VoiceTraining_[EpisodeNumber]_[SegmentNumber].wav`
   - Example: `VoiceTraining_Ep132_Seg03.wav`

### Step 4: Audio Processing (Optional)

If necessary, apply minimal processing to improve quality:

1. **Noise Reduction**
   - Apply gentle noise reduction if consistent background noise exists
   - Use the noise profile feature in your audio editor
   - Keep reduction subtle (10-15%) to avoid artifacts

2. **Volume Normalization**
   - Target RMS level: -18dB to -23dB
   - Ensure peaks don't exceed -3dB
   - Maintain natural dynamic range

3. **Silent Gap Editing**
   - Remove silent gaps exceeding 2 seconds
   - Keep natural pauses intact
   - Ensure smooth transitions between thoughts

> **Important:** Minimal processing is key. Over-processing can make the voice clone sound artificial.

### Step 5: Compilation

1. **Create a master training file** by combining your best segments:
   - Target length: 20-30 minutes (minimum 10 minutes)
   - Order segments to provide variety throughout
   - Insert 1-second silence between segments
   - Export as a single WAV file named `Descript_VoiceTraining_Master.wav`

2. **Create a secondary test file** with different content:
   - Length: 2-3 minutes
   - Include content similar to your planned homilies
   - Use for validation after training

### Step 6: Descript Voice Clone Training

1. **Create a new AI Speaker in Descript**
   - Name: Use your name with context (e.g., "Craig - Homilies")
   - Upload your master training file
   - Follow Descript's authorization process

2. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Generate test sentences to evaluate voice quality
   - Compare with your natural speech in the test file
   - If needed, update training file with additional segments

## Quality Checklist for Final Training File

- [ ] Total duration: 20-30 minutes minimum
- [ ] Includes varied speech patterns and emotional tones
- [ ] Clear audio quality throughout
- [ ] Natural transitions between segments
- [ ] Appropriate volume levels (peaks below -3dB)
- [ ] Contains theological terminology you'll use in homilies
- [ ] No background music or other speakers
- [ ] Minimal processing artifacts

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Potential Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Robotic-sounding voice clone | Add more emotionally varied content to training file |
| Unnatural pauses | Ensure training file has natural speech rhythm examples |
| Mispronunciation of terms | Include more examples of theological terms in training |
| Inconsistent volume | Normalize audio more carefully, avoiding over-compression |
| "Generic" sounding clone | Add more of your unique speaking patterns and cadence |

## Next Steps After Voice Training

Once your voice clone is created:
1. Test with a short homily script (100-200 words)
2. Adjust prosody and emphasis using Descript's tools
3. Document settings that work best for your voice
4. Create a standard homily template optimized for your voice clone

Remember, the quality of your voice clone directly reflects the quality of your training data. Investing time in selecting and preparing optimal audio segments will significantly improve your results.
