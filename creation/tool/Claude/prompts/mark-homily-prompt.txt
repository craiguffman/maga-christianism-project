# Mark Homily Creation Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt template transforms insights from your Mark sermon series into concise homilies optimized for text-to-audio recording using Descript, creating accessible audio content that communicates Mark's counter-imperial message.

## Storage Location
All homily scripts should be stored in the following directory structure:
- `/Users/craiguffman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/Mac/Documents/GitHub/maga-christianism-project/content/audio/homilies/mark/[passage-reference].md`

## Prompt Template

```
I need you to transform my Mark sermon into a concise homily optimized for text-to-audio recording using Descript:

Source Sermon: [SERMON_TITLE]
Scripture: [MARK_PASSAGE]
Key Theological Insight: [PRIMARY_INSIGHT]
Target Length: [5-7 MINUTES / 750-1000 WORDS]
Primary Mutation Confronted: [MUTATION]

Please create a markdown artifact with the file path at the very top of the document:

/Users/craiguffman/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/Mac/Documents/GitHub/maga-christianism-project/content/audio/homilies/mark/[passage-reference].md

Then create a homily with these components:

# [TITLE]: A Homily Based on [MARK_PASSAGE]
**Word Count:** [ACTUAL_WORD_COUNT]
**Audio Length:** Approximately [X] minutes

---

[HOMILY TEXT WITH AUDIO FORMATTING]

The homily should include:

1. **Opening Hook**: A compelling introduction that connects Mark's context to our contemporary moment (1-2 paragraphs)

2. **Scripture Focus**: Presentation of the key Mark passage with emphasis on its subversive elements (1-2 paragraphs)

3. **Historical Context**: Brief explanation of the Roman imperial context that makes Mark's message powerful (1-2 paragraphs)

4. **Theological Insight**: Clear explanation of the primary theological insight that counters imperial theology (2-3 paragraphs)

5. **Contemporary Application**: Direct application to our current context and MAGA Christianism (2-3 paragraphs)

6. **Conclusion**: Inspiring call to embrace Mark's counter-imperial vision (1 paragraph)

Audio formatting instructions:
- Use [PAUSE Xs] to indicate pauses (typically 1-2 seconds)
- Use [EMPHASIZE] to indicate words that should receive vocal emphasis
- Use short, clear sentences optimized for audio clarity
- Include natural transitions between sections
- Format for conversational delivery rather than academic presentation
- Break long paragraphs into shorter ones for easier reading
- Use parallel structure and repetition for emphasis and memorability
```

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on a single, powerful theological insight from Mark rather than attempting comprehensive coverage
- Create clear contrasts between imperial/MAGA theology and Mark's counter-imperial message
- Use concrete language and vivid imagery that works well in audio format
- Optimize for your natural speaking cadence and vocal patterns
- Include audio-specific formatting that will make recording in Descript smoother
- Keep total length under 1,000 words for approximately 6-7 minutes of audio content
