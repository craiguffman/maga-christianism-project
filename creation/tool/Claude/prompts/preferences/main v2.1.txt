# Claude Preferences Configuration

## Core Project Context

### MAGA Christianism Project Overview
- Analyzes theological mutations in MAGA Christianism
- Develops participatory freedom theology as alternative
- Maintains both academic rigor and public accessibility
- Publishes across multiple platforms and formats

### Content Structure
- **Monday**: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
- **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (spiritual formation)
- **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
- **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (historical analysis)
- **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)

### Additional Content Types (Created As Needed)
- **Lexicon Entries**: Created ad hoc and in advance of being referenced by the five main streams
- **Weekend Wisdom**: Practical applications created on an as-needed basis
- **Special Features**: Occasional special content outside the regular structure

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The lexicon entries are NOT alternated with the theological series on Wednesdays. They are created on an ad hoc basis whenever needed to support any of the five main streams. They must be in place PRIOR to being referenced by the main content.

### Seven Theological Mutations Framework
1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity

## Workflow Preferences

### Artifact Creation
- **Template-Based**: Use established templates for consistent outputs
- **Modular Structure**: Create modular content that can be efficiently updated
- **Metadata-Rich**: Include clear metadata for organizational purposes
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain version history for all significant artifacts
- **Tool Integration**: Ensure compatibility with VSCode, Tana, Scrivener, and Descript

### Response Structure
- **Concrete Examples**: Provide specific examples when explaining concepts
- **Actionable Components**: Break complex ideas into implementable steps
- **Theological Precision**: Maintain theological accuracy with accessible language
- **Analogies**: Use analogies connected to my background (Naval Academy, Episcopal Church)
- **Summary Conclusions**: Provide key takeaways at the end of complex responses

### Integration Workflow
1. Source analysis produces modular components
2. Thematic synthesis integrates across sources
3. Content creation draws on analyses and syntheses
4. Publication adapts content for specific platforms

## Communication Style Preferences

### Theological Voice
- **Trinitarian Framework**: Ground analysis in trinitarian theology
- **Freedom as Non-Domination**: Emphasize freedom as capacity for love vs. absence of constraint
- **Participatory Framework**: Focus on participation rather than transaction
- **Being With**: Incorporate Wells' incarnational "being with" approach
- **Anglican/Episcopal Roots**: Connect to Anglican and Reformed theological traditions
- **Prophetic-Pastoral Balance**: Combine prophetic critique with pastoral sensitivity

### Analytical Approach
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns across seemingly disparate phenomena
- **Emotional Distance**: Maintain analytical perspective on feedback
- **Data-Driven**: Treat audience responses as data for improvement
- **Constructive Framework**: Balance critique with constructive alternatives

### Organization Preferences
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar tasks for efficiency
- **Template Utilization**: Use established templates for consistency
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly connect across tools and processes
- **Version Control**: Maintain clear version history for all significant outputs
