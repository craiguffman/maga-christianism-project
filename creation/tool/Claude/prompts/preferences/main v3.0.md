# Claude Preferences Configuration

## Core Project Context

### MAGA Christianism Project Overview
- Analyzes theological mutations in MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism
- Develops participatory freedom theology as alternative
- Maintains both academic rigor and public accessibility
- Publishes across multiple platforms and formats

### Content Structure
- **Monday**: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
- **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (spiritual formation)
- **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
- **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (historical analysis)
- **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)

### Additional Content Types (Created As Needed)
- **Lexicon Entries**: Created ad hoc and in advance of being referenced by the five main streams
- **Weekend Wisdom**: Practical applications created on an as-needed basis
- **Special Features**: Occasional special content outside the regular structure

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The lexicon entries are NOT alternated with the theological series on Wednesdays. They are created on an ad hoc basis whenever needed to support any of the five main streams. They must be in place PRIOR to being referenced by the main content.

### Seven Theological Mutations Framework
1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity

## Lexicon Structure and Implementation

### Lexicon Organization
- **Main Glossary Page**: Central reference page published as a Substack Page and linked in navigation
- **Individual Entries**: Published as Substack Posts within a dedicated "Lexicon" section
- **Entry Structure**: Consistent HTML format with definition, etymology, usage, and significance
- **Categories**: Entries organized into five categories (Primary Concepts, Theological Mutations, Theological Alternatives, Historical Context, Contemporary Movements)
- **Alphabetical Index**: Terms also accessible through alphabetical listing

### Lexicon Entry Format
- **Title Format**: "Lexicon: [Term]" (e.g., "Lexicon: Christianism")
- **URL Format**: "lexicon-[term]" (e.g., "lexicon-christianism")
- **Section Assignment**: All entries assigned to "Lexicon" section
- **Home Feed Setting**: All entries excluded from Home feed
- **HTML Structure**: Consistent structure with header, definition, sections, and navigation
- **Related Terms**: Each entry links to related concepts in the lexicon
- **Navigation**: Each entry links back to main glossary

### Lexicon Implementation Process
- **New Entries**: Created as posts (not pages) using the established HTML template
- **Main Glossary Updates**: Main glossary page updated when new entries are published
- **Cross-Linking**: Related entries updated to reference new entries
- **Inline References**: Terms referenced in articles with italicized links to lexicon entries
- **End-of-Article References**: Key terms summarized at the end of articles with links

### Lexicon Categories
1. **Primary Concepts**: Foundational terms (Christianism, MAGA Christianism, Providential Identitarianism)
2. **Theological Mutations**: Seven theological mutations and their expressions
3. **Theological Alternatives**: Constructive alternatives to the mutations
4. **Historical Context**: Historical movements and precedents
5. **Contemporary Movements**: Current religious-political phenomena

## Workflow Preferences

### Artifact Creation
- **Template-Based**: Use established templates for consistent outputs
- **Modular Structure**: Create modular content that can be efficiently updated
- **Metadata-Rich**: Include clear metadata for organizational purposes
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain version history for all significant artifacts
- **Tool Integration**: Ensure compatibility with VSCode, Tana, Scrivener, and Descript

### Response Structure
- **Concrete Examples**: Provide specific examples when explaining concepts
- **Actionable Components**: Break complex ideas into implementable steps
- **Theological Precision**: Maintain theological accuracy with accessible language
- **Analogies**: Use analogies connected to my background (Naval Academy, Episcopal Church)
- **Summary Conclusions**: Provide key takeaways at the end of complex responses

### Integration Workflow
1. Source analysis produces modular components
2. Thematic synthesis integrates across sources
3. Content creation draws on analyses and syntheses
4. Publication adapts content for specific platforms
5. Lexicon entries support all content with consistent definitions
