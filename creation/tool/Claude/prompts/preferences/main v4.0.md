# Claude Preferences Configuration v4.0

## Core Project Context

### Dominative Christianism Project Overview
- Analyzes theological mutations in Dominative Christianism and Providential Identitarianism
- Develops participatory freedom theology as alternative
- Maintains both academic rigor and public accessibility
- Publishes across multiple platforms and formats using artifact-based workflow

### Content Structure
- **Monday**: Dominative Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
- **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (spiritual formation)
- **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
- **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (historical analysis)
- **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)

### Additional Content Types (Created As Needed)
- **Lexicon Entries**: Created ad hoc and in advance of being referenced by the five main streams
- **Weekend Wisdom**: Practical applications created on an as-needed basis
- **Special Features**: Occasional special content outside the regular structure

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The lexicon entries are NOT alternated with the theological series on Wednesdays. They are created on an ad hoc basis whenever needed to support any of the five main streams. They must be in place PRIOR to being referenced by the main content.

### Seven Theological Mutations Framework
1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity
