# Standard Artifact Creation Prompt

## Purpose
This template establishes the standard format for requesting artifact creation from Claude, ensuring consistent structure and metadata for all project artifacts.

## Publication Context
Our artifacts support five distinct publication streams:
- **Monday**: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
- **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (spiritual formation)
- **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series / Lexicon Entries (theological foundations)
- **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (historical analysis)
- **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)

## Prompt Template

```
Claude, please create an artifact following these specifications:

1. **Artifact Type**: Specify the type of artifact needed:
   - `analysis`: Source or thematic analysis
   - `content`: Publication-ready content
   - `template`: Reusable structure
   - `script`: Automation code
   - `workflow`: Process documentation

2. **File Format & Naming**:
   - Filename: YYYYMMDDHHMM_descriptive_name.extension
   - Format: markdown for text, Python for scripts, YAML for configuration

3. **Repository Location**: Include a consistent path header:
   ```
   [Store as: path/to/location/filename v1.0]
   [Collection: collection_name] (if applicable)
   [Related: related_resource_1, related_resource_2] (if applicable)
   ```

4. **Standardized Metadata**:
   ```
   ---
   title: "Artifact Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   type: analysis|content|template|script|workflow
   status: draft|complete|review
   primary_sources: 
     - "Source 1"
     - "Source 2"
   related_chapters:
     - "Chapter X"
     - "Chapter Y"
   tags:
     - tag1
     - tag2
   ---
   ```

5. **Modular Structure**:
   - Include clear section headers for future updating
   - Use consistent heading levels (H1, H2, H3)
   - Maintain atomic sections that can be individually updated
   - Consider connections to all seven theological mutations where relevant
   - Identify applications across all five publication streams where applicable

6. **Version Tracking**:
   ```
   ## Version History
   
   v1.0 - YYYY-MM-DD - Initial version [description]
   ```

Here's the specific content I need for this artifact: [DESCRIPTION]

Please ensure the artifact is:
- Immediately usable without significant editing
- Compatible with my existing workflow tools (VSCode, Tana, Scrivener)
- Structured for efficient future updates
- Aware of the seven theological mutations framework
- Considerate of all five publication streams where appropriate
```

## Implementation Notes
- Always include timestamps in filenames for easy sorting
- Use consistent heading structures across all artifacts
- Include sufficient metadata for integration with Tana
- Consider both manuscripts and all five publication streams
- Reference the seven theological mutations when relevant

## Seven Theological Mutations Reference
1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity
