# Knowledge Object Index

This index catalogs all knowledge objects in the MAGA Christianism project. Knowledge objects represent conceptual, structural, and analytical units that form the foundation of the research framework, distinct from notes and creation items.

## Topics

```
#knowledge/topic
  └── nationalism_thin_ideology [Freeden's analysis of nationalism as thin-centered ideology] v1.0
  └── [Additional topics will be added as they are created]
```

## Concepts

```
#knowledge/concept
  └── [To be populated as concepts are created]
```

## Frameworks

```
#knowledge/framework
  └── [To be populated as frameworks are created]
```

## Mental Models

```
#knowledge/mental_model
  └── [To be populated as mental models are created]
```

## Syntopical Documents

```
#knowledge/syntopical_document
  └── [To be populated as syntopical documents are created]
```

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use knowledge objects to organize fundamental theoretical and analytical units
- Distinguish knowledge objects from notes (processing materials) and creation objects (deliverables)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and relationship mapping
- Update this index when adding new knowledge objects
