# Master Chapter-Source Index v3.0

This comprehensive index maps all source materials to specific chapters in both the MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism books, along with relevant sermon connections. This document serves as the central reference for maintaining consistent sourcing across both analytical frameworks.

Each book is structured with parallel chapters to facilitate comparative analysis of the two theological mutations while maintaining their distinct characteristics. Relevant sermon connections are identified for each chapter, supporting the integration of Mark's counter-imperial voice throughout both analytical approaches.
