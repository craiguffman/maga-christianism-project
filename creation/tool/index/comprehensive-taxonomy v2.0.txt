## Versioning Structure

Each content item should include version information in Tana, following this pattern:

```
#creation/content/essay/maga_christianism/introduction
  └── v1.0 [Initial draft]
  └── v1.1 [Minor revisions]
  └── v2.0 [Major revision]
```

## Integration with Publication Streams

This taxonomy aligns with the five publication streams:

1. **Monday**: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (`#creation/content/essay/maga_christianism/*`)
2. **Tuesday**: Rooted & Reaching Personal Essays (`#creation/content/personal_essay/*`)
3. **Wednesday**: Common Life Politics Essays (`#creation/content/essay/common_life_politics/*`) and Lexicon Entries (`#creation/content/lexicon/*`)
4. **Thursday**: Untold America Historical Confessionals (`#creation/content/historical/*`)
5. **Friday**: Divine Republic Satirical Pieces (`#creation/content/satire/*`)

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Tana Nodes**: Create this hierarchy as Tana nodes, with each content item as a supertag
2. **Version Tracking**: Add version nodes beneath each content item
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Use related nodes to connect related content across taxonomies
4. **Metadata**: Include publication date, status, and related sources as metadata

## Version History

v2.0 - 2025-03-31 - Enhanced taxonomy with complete content structure for all publication streams
