## Revised Tag Structure

### Knowledge vs. Notes

You're correct that synthesis represents knowledge, not just notes about sources. Here's a better approach:

1. **#knowledge/source_integration** - Knowledge derived from a single source
   - This recognizes that your synthesis of a source is knowledge, not just a note
   - Example: #knowledge/source_integration/bretherton

2. **#knowledge/thematic_integration** - Cross-source knowledge organized by theme
   - This is absolutely knowledge rather than notes
   - Example: #knowledge/thematic_integration/primitive_biblicism

3. **#topic/mutation** - Mutations as specialized topics
   - Instead of creating a new tag type, recognize mutations as topics
   - Example: #topic/mutation/practical_atheism

### Templates and References

For templates and recurring references:

4. **#creation/template** - For design templates and content structures
   - Example: #creation/template/substack_analytical_post
   - This would store your SubStack post template, header designs, etc.

5. **#knowledge/prompt** - For Claude prompts and interaction patterns
   - Example: #knowledge/prompt/source_analysis
   - Contains reusable prompts for specific types of Claude interactions

### Indexes and Project Artifacts

For tracking documents:

6. **#creation/project_index** - For reference documents that organize project elements
   - Example: #creation/project_index/chapter_source
   - These are creations that help organize but aren't themselves content

7. **#creation/synthesis_document** - For consolidated synthesis documents
   - Example: #creation/synthesis_document/consolidated_notes
   - These are not raw knowledge but creative arrangements of knowledge

## Integration Example

Here's how this revised structure would work for Bretherton's text:

1. **Original source**: #source/book/bretherton
2. **Atomic insights**: #note/atomic/bretherton_co-option
3. **Source integration**: #knowledge/source_integration/bretherton
4. **Thematic knowledge**: #knowledge/thematic_integration/practical_atheism
5. **Topic connection**: #topic/mutation/practical_atheism
6. **Chapter planning**: #creation/project_index/chapter_1

This approach:
- Recognizes syntheses as knowledge, not just notes
- Uses your existing categories rather than creating new ones
- Treats mutations as specialized topics
- Properly categorizes templates and prompts
- Distinguishes between knowledge and organizational artifacts
