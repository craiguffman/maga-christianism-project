## Implementation Guidelines
- Use knowledge objects to organize fundamental theoretical and analytical units
- Distinguish knowledge objects from notes (processing materials) and creation objects (deliverables)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and relationship mapping
- Update this index when adding new knowledge objects
- Ensure all knowledge objects address both mutations when relevant
- Integrate sermon content connections throughout knowledge organization
- Establish clear connections to Participatory Freedom Theology
