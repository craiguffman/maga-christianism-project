# MAGA Christianism Project Framework v3.0
*Last Updated: 2025-03-31*

## Overview
This document captures the comprehensive framework for the MAGA Christianism project, integrating:
- Seven theological mutations analysis
- Dual mutation approach (MAGA Christianism + Providential Identitarianism)
- Mark sermon integration strategies
- Content stream organization (Monday-Saturday)
- Publication planning and workflow

## Core Theoretical Framework

### Seven Theological Mutations
1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity

### Dual Mutation Analysis
Both MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism represent parallel theological mutations from the same Calvinist roots, manifesting the seven mutations in mirrored ways:

**MAGA Christianism**:
- Emphasizes nationalist identity
- Advocates hierarchical authority
- Maintains conservative boundary markers

**Providential Identitarianism**:
- Emphasizes progressive identity
- Advocates expertise-driven authority
- Maintains progressive boundary markers

### Participatory Freedom Theology
The constructive alternative emphasizes:
- Freedom as capacity to love God and neighbor without domination
- Mutual interindependence as the true nature of human flourishing
- Trinity as model of communion without domination
- Being with (Wells) rather than working for or to others
- Boundary-crossing as Christian vocation

## Sermon Integration Strategy

### Triple Voice Structure
For each key theological concept, use a structured analysis:
1. **"Mark Says..."** - Drawing directly from sermon insights on how Jesus challenges domination systems
2. **"MAGA Christianism Says..."** - Showing how this mutation distorts Jesus's teachings
3. **"Providential Identitarianism Says..."** - Demonstrating how this parallel mutation also misappropriates Jesus's teachings

### Thematic Mapping Approach
Organize sermon material thematically around the seven theological mutations:
- Select relevant Mark passages that address each mutation
- Focus on Jesus's "third way" that transcends both contemporary mutations
- Highlight boundary-crossing practices in Jesus's ministry

### Sermon Metadata Framework
Tags for organizing sermon insights:
- Theological mutation addressed
- Counter-imperial themes
- Boundary-crossing elements
- Contemporary applications
