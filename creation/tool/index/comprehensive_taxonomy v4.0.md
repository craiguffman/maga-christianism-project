# Comprehensive Content Taxonomy v4.0

This taxonomy provides a structured organization for all content types in the expanded MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism project, optimized for Tana implementation and aligned with the publication streams, sermon integration, and lexicon system.

## Lexicon Implementation

### Publication Format
- **Main Glossary**: Published as a Substack Page added to navigation
- **Individual Entries**: Published as Substack Posts in "Lexicon" section (hidden from Home feed)
- **Entry URLs**: Follow consistent pattern "lexicon-[term]" (e.g., "lexicon-christianism")
- **Cross-Linking**: All entries linked from main glossary and cross-linked to related terms

### Tagging Structure
```
#creation/content/lexicon/[category]/[term_name]
  └── v1.0 [Initial publication]
  └── v1.1 [Minor revisions]
  └── v2.0 [Major revision]
```

### Inline Reference System
- First mention of technical terms in content linked to lexicon entries
- End-of-article glossary sections with brief definitions and links to full entries
- Consistent italicized formatting for first mentions of technical terms

## Integration with Publication Streams

The lexicon system supports all publication streams:

1. **Monday**: Lexicon entries support MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism book chapters
2. **Tuesday**: Lexicon entries provide theological context for personal essays
3. **Wednesday**: Lexicon entries define terms used in Common Life Politics essays
4. **Thursday**: Lexicon entries provide historical context for Untold America essays
5. **Friday**: Lexicon entries explain concepts satirized in Divine Republic pieces
6. **Sunday**: Lexicon entries clarify theological concepts in Mark sermons

## Versioning Structure

Each content item should include version information in Tana, following this pattern:

```
#creation/content/lexicon/primary_concepts/christianism
  └── v1.0 [Initial draft]
  └── v1.1 [Minor revisions]
  └── v2.0 [Major revision]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Tana Nodes**: Create this hierarchy as Tana nodes, with each content item as a supertag
2. **Version Tracking**: Add version nodes beneath each content item
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Use related nodes to connect related content across taxonomies
4. **Metadata**: Include publication date, status, and related sources as metadata
5. **Sermon Integration**: Ensure sermon themes are integrated with weekly publication content
6. **Dual Mutation Analysis**: Maintain parallel analysis structure for both mutations
7. **Thematic Alignment**: Use weekly themes to align content across streams
8. **Lexicon Integration**: Create lexicon entries before referencing terms in main content
