# Source Analysis Prompt

[Store as: #creation/tool/prompt/source_analysis v1.0]

## Purpose
Use this prompt when asking Claude to analyze a new academic source for integration into the MAGA Christianism project.

## Prompt Template

```
I need your help analyzing the following source for my MAGA Christianism project:

Source: [AUTHOR], [TITLE] ([YEAR])

I'm particularly interested in how this source relates to the three theological mutations I've identified:
1. Primitive Biblicism - Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning that bypasses interpretive traditions
2. Practical Atheism - Removes Jesus as exemplar and replaces him with pragmatic politics disconnected from Christ's example
3. Binary Apocalypticism - Divides the world into good and evil, friends and enemies, saved and damned

Please analyze this source with the following structure:

1. Core Thesis - What is the central argument or insight of this work?

2. Key Insights - What are 3-5 major concepts or arguments that could inform my analysis?

3. Connection to Mutations - How does this source illuminate, challenge, or provide resources for analyzing each of the three mutations?

4. Economic Dimensions - How does this source address economic frameworks, assumptions, or implications? (Drawing on Bretherton, Levy, or Slobodian as appropriate)

5. Theological Implications - How might this source inform a constructive theological response?

6. Potential Chapters - Which chapters of my book might this source be most relevant for?

7. Methodological Contribution - How does this source contribute to my analytical approach?

8. Integration with Other Sources - How does this source connect to [RELATED SOURCES]?

In your analysis, please maintain my theological voice as described in the Voice Synthesis Guide, particularly the emphasis on freedom as non-domination, trinitarian foundations, and the "being with" framework from Wells.
```

## Important Notes

1. Always insert specific chapter titles from the chapter-source index when suggesting chapter connections

2. In the [RELATED SOURCES] section, include 2-3 sources that seem most relevant to the new source, drawing from previously analyzed works

3. Ensure the analysis includes both critical and constructive elements - how the source helps both diagnose the mutations and construct alternatives

4. Pay special attention to economic dimensions, as this is a key aspect of the project's distinctive contribution

5. When analyzing historical or contextual sources, emphasize patterns that illuminate current phenomena rather than simply historical interest

## Voice Guidelines

1. Maintain an academic but accessible tone that balances theological depth with clear communication

2. Draw connections to the trinitarian framework of freedom as non-domination and God's self-giving love without domination

3. Emphasize the integration of both theological analysis and social/economic/political dimensions

4. Incorporate the "being with" framework from Wells when relevant to constructive alternatives

5. Balance prophetic critique with hopeful constructive vision

## Example Analysis Fragments

### Example Core Thesis
"Slobodian's central thesis is that neoliberalism should be understood not primarily as market fundamentalism but as a project designed to insulate markets from democratic demands through global institutional structures. This perspective illuminates how MAGA Christianism's theology often functions to sacralize economic arrangements that prioritize market logic over democratic deliberation."

### Example Connection to Mutations
"Bretherton's concept of 'co-option, competition, and commodification' provides a powerful analytical framework for understanding how Practical Atheism operates in MAGA Christianism. His analysis shows how political movements co-opt religious language while emptying it of its theological substance, particularly removing Christ as exemplar and replacing him with pragmatic political figures who bear little resemblance to Jesus's example."

### Example Economic Dimensions
"Levy's historical analysis of American capitalism reveals how economic anxiety has repeatedly been channeled into apocalyptic religious frameworks. This illuminates how Binary Apocalypticism in MAGA Christianism often functions to transform economic dislocations into cosmic moral narratives, obscuring the constructed nature of economic arrangements behind a veil of divine ordination."
