# Thematic Synthesis Prompt

[Store as: #creation/tool/prompt/thematic_synthesis v1.0]

## Purpose
Use this prompt when asking Claude to generate or update thematic synthesis documents that integrate insights across multiple sources on a specific theme or concept in the MAGA Christianism project.

## Prompt Template

```
I need your help creating/updating a thematic synthesis on [THEME/CONCEPT] for my MAGA Christianism project.

This synthesis should integrate insights from the following sources:
- [SOURCE 1]
- [SOURCE 2]
- [SOURCE 3]
[Add additional sources as needed]

Please create a comprehensive synthesis with the following structure:

1. Definition - Provide a precise definition of the theme/concept that captures its essence in the context of MAGA Christianism

2. Key Characteristics - Identify and analyze the primary features or patterns, organized into appropriate categories (theological, methodological, historical, etc.)

3. Historical Genealogy - Trace the historical development and influences that shaped this phenomenon

4. Connection to Other Mutations - Explain how this theme connects to the three theological mutations (Primitive Biblicism, Practical Atheism, Binary Apocalypticism)

5. Economic Dimensions - Analyze how economic frameworks, assumptions, or implications shape or are shaped by this theme (drawing on Bretherton, Levy, or Slobodian)

6. Case Studies - Provide 2-3 concrete examples that illustrate the pattern in action

7. Constructive Alternative - Present a theologically grounded alternative vision

8. Theological Response - Outline key theological resources for addressing this theme

In developing this synthesis, please maintain my theological voice as described in the Voice Synthesis Guide, particularly the emphasis on freedom as non-domination, trinitarian foundations, and the "being with" framework from Wells.

Include specific source references throughout the document to maintain clear connections between insights and their sources.
```

## Important Notes

1. Thematic synthesis documents should integrate insights from at least 5-7 sources to provide comprehensive analysis

2. Always cite specific sources for key insights using a consistent format (Author, Title)

3. Identify patterns across sources rather than simply summarizing individual sources

4. Pay special attention to economic dimensions and their theological implications

5. Ensure the synthesis includes both critical analysis and constructive alternatives

6. When updating existing synthesis documents, maintain the established structure while integrating new insights

## Voice Guidelines

1. Balance academic precision with accessible language

2. Ground analysis in trinitarian theology and the concept of freedom as non-domination

3. Connect theological analysis to concrete socio-political and economic realities

4. Incorporate both prophetic critique and hopeful vision

5. Use effective metaphors and examples to illustrate complex concepts

## Example Synthesis Fragments

### Example Definition
"Binary Apocalypticism represents the third theological mutation in MAGA Christianism, characterized by a dualistic worldview that divides reality into absolute categories of good and evil, friends and enemies, saved and damned. This mutation transforms the Christian hope for reconciliation into a vision of ultimate separation, replacing the universal scope of God's redemptive action with a narrative of divine vengeance against enemies and vindication of the chosen."

### Example Key Characteristics
"Methodological Dimensions of Primitive Biblicism include:

1. **Ramist Realism**: Claims direct access to objective meaning through a method of definition and division that treats abstract categories as more real than particular instances
   - Sources: Ramist Realism Analysis, Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology (McCormack)
   - Example: Reducing complex biblical narratives to 'principles' and 'steps' without regard for literary genre or historical context

2. **Decontextualization**: Removes biblical texts from their historical, literary, and canonical contexts
   - Sources: Art of Reading Scripture, Pauline Dogmatics (Campbell)
   - Example: Treating individual verses as standalone 'truth statements' apart from their narrative function"

### Example Economic Dimensions
"Economic Dimensions of Practical Atheism include:

1. **Market Priority**: Economic interests prioritized over theological commitments
   - Sources: Economic Framework document, Christianity and Contemporary Politics (Bretherton)
   - Example: Policy positions determined by economic interests rather than theological principles

2. **Economic Determinism**: Treatment of market arrangements as inevitable rather than constructed
   - Sources: Jonathan Levy's work, Quinn Slobodian's analysis
   - Example: Economic inequality viewed as natural rather than result of policy choices"
