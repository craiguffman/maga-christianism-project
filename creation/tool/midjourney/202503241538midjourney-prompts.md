### Notes on Image Selection:

- For Substack, the image should be more academic and conceptual, visually representing the theological critique while maintaining scholarly gravitas.

- For Facebook, the image should be warmer, more personal, and focused on community and hope rather than critique, aligning with the more personal tone of the Facebook post.

- All images avoid including people's faces to prevent potential recognition issues while focusing on symbolic representation.

- Each prompt emphasizes high-quality, editorial-style imagery appropriate for serious theological and political discussion.
