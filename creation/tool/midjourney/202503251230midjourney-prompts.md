## SubStack Header Image Prompt

```
A close-up of older hands gently working in rich, dark garden soil, with small seedlings just emerging, photographed from above. Earthy tones of brown soil and vibrant green sprouts. Soft natural lighting with slight shadows creating depth. Textured soil with visible organic matter. A sense of nurturing and patience. Photographic style, shallow depth of field, high-quality documentary photography. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

## Facebook Post Image Prompt

```
Close-up of hands holding a cup of coffee while overlooking a garden at dawn, photographed from first-person perspective. Garden with morning dew catching sunlight. Soft golden hour lighting. A mixture of vegetables, native flowers, and fruit trees visible in the background. Natural, authentic feel with rich colors and textures. Subtle morning mist. Photographic style, contemplative mood, high-quality lifestyle photography. --ar 1:1 --style raw --no text
```

## Alternative SubStack Header Option

```
Side-by-side contrast: left side shows conventional metrics (calendar, stopwatch, scale, financial chart) in sharp black and white; right side shows alternative metrics (person present in conversation, garden growth, hands offering help) in warm, rich colors. Conceptual illustration style with meaningful symbolism. Thoughtful composition showing transformation from one measurement system to another. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

## Alternative Facebook Post Option

```
A garden path winding through various stages of growth, from freshly tilled soil to full bloom, viewed from above. A single set of footprints visible along the path. Morning light creating long shadows. Natural color palette of greens, browns, and earthy tones with pops of flower colors. Symbolic journey imagery. Photographic style with atmospheric lighting. --ar 1:1 --style raw --no text

## Technical Notes
- For SubStack header, the 16:9 aspect ratio works best for the platform's layout
- For Facebook, the 1:1 square format performs better in feeds
- Use `--style raw` to avoid Midjourney's stylistic flourishes and keep a more authentic look
- Use `--no text` to prevent Midjourney from adding any text elements
- All prompts designed to align with the "Rooted & Reaching" series aesthetic: earthy, authentic, natural
