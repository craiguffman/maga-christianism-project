## Introduction: The Landscape of Our Common Life

We are not strangers to each other. We are neighbors who have forgotten how to speak.

In an age where political tribalism has become our native tongue, this collection of essays offers not an argument but an invitation—a persistent call to remember what binds us together despite our deepest differences. These reflections emerge from my own journey through segregated Louisiana childhood, Naval service, and theological education—a path that taught me how freedom can be misunderstood, community forgotten, and truth obscured, yet also how these virtues might be reclaimed.

Our republic finds itself in a moment of profound fracture. The soil of our common life has hardened, cracked by drought. We've transformed our differences from sources of potential abundance into battle lines of mutual destruction. Political identity has become a kind of religious faith, complete with orthodoxies, heretics, and rituals of excommunication. Meanwhile, the genuine resources of faith traditions have been reduced to weapons in cultural warfare rather than wellsprings of reconciliation and justice.

But what if our differences could be something else? What if, like companion plants in a garden, our distinct perspectives could nourish rather than deplete the soil we share? What if the very act of listening—truly listening—were itself a radical political practice, a small resurrection in a landscape of death?

Each essay in this collection takes up a vital virtue—truth, empathy, justice, freedom—not as abstract principles but as embodied practices. Drawing from Anglican theology, philosophical insights on freedom as non-domination, and the lived experience of military service and recovery from workaholism, these reflections invite us to consider how we might cultivate these virtues in our everyday lives. They suggest that political renewal begins not in legislative chambers but in the small, often overlooked moments of genuine human encounter where we practice being with rather than merely doing for one another.

This is not a book of easy answers. The path from domination to freedom, from tribal fear to genuine community, requires more than policy prescriptions. It demands a different kind of formation—one that shapes both character and imagination. It calls us to practices of tolerance, forbearance, and hospitality that run counter to our culture's addiction to outrage and binary thinking.

We are, each of us, far more than the political labels we've been assigned. We participate in multiple traditions, carry complex histories, and harbor capacities for both tremendous harm and remarkable grace. The water fountain liturgies of segregated childhoods have formed us without our awareness, yet we remain capable of reformation through different practices, different stories, different ways of being with one another.

Our republic is not beyond healing, but healing requires something more fundamental than policy change. It requires the patient work of tending soil long depleted, of planting perennials whose fruit we may not live to harvest. It demands the courage to prune what cannot bear fruit and to nourish what remains with the waters of truth and the sunlight of genuine presence.

Let us begin this work together, not as strangers but as neighbors rediscovering a common language of care for the garden we share.

## A Note on Citations

This advance review manuscript presents the conceptual framework and core content of the essays while omitting formal citations for readability. The final publication will include comprehensive citations acknowledging all scholarly influences, particularly the work of Stanley Hauerwas, Luke Bretherton, Douglas Campbell, Philip Pettit, and Sam Wells, whose theological and philosophical insights have profoundly shaped this project.

The introduction will also more extensively acknowledge key influences across theological, military, and political spheres that have informed these reflections.
