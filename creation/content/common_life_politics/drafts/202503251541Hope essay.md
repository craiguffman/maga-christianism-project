# Hope: Vision Beyond Resistance

During a tense vestry meeting about whether to welcome Afghan refugees into our church community, I witnessed something extraordinary. A Vietnam veteran who had initially opposed the idea stood up slowly, his hands trembling slightly. "I fought against people who looked like them," he said, his voice catching. "But last Sunday, watching that family sing alongside us in worship... I saw something I'd forgotten was possible." He paused, eyes glistening. "I don't know if this will work. But I'm willing to try."

This moment captures what theologians call hope as virtue—not a feeling based on favorable evidence, but a commitment to act as if reconciliation were possible even when all evidence suggests otherwise. Unlike optimism, which rises and falls with circumstances, hope persists as a disciplined practice of seeing and pursuing possibility beyond present limitation. As we navigate a political landscape increasingly dominated by cynicism, despair, and false promises, we need to recover hope as a theological virtue with revolutionary implications for our common life.

## The Crisis of Hope

Hope is perhaps the most endangered theological virtue in our time. We face multiple temptations that pull us away from authentic hope: cynicism that sees only corruption in every institution; despair that abandons the possibility of meaningful change; and perhaps most dangerous, counterfeit hope that promises easy solutions to complex problems.

Political narratives across the spectrum participate in these distortions. MAGA Christianism offers nostalgia disguised as hope—a promised return to an idealized past that never actually existed. Progressive movements sometimes succumb to inevitability narratives—the assumption that the arc of history bends toward justice without human participation. Both represent misunderstandings of genuine hope.

This failure of hope reflects what we've identified as the third mutation in MAGA Christianism: binary apocalypticism. By dividing the world into absolute categories of good and evil, friends and enemies, this framework creates a vision where hope requires not patient participation but decisive victory. Such binary thinking cannot sustain the complex, often ambiguous work that genuine hope requires.

## Hope as Participatory Virtue

As a grad student at Duke examining Aquinas on hope, I explored how hope differs fundamentally from both optimism and wishful thinking. Optimism is a feeling grounded in favorable evidence; wishful thinking is emotional escape from unfavorable evidence. Hope, by contrast, is a virtue—a habitual disposition formed through practice—that persists regardless of evidence.

Aquinas understood hope as simultaneously gift and task. As gift, it flows from grace rather than human effort. As task, it requires our active participation and practice. Hope occupies the middle ground between presumption (assuming God's action requires nothing of us) and despair (believing God's promises cannot be fulfilled through our participation).

This participatory understanding aligns with our broader theological framework. Just as we've seen that freedom means capacity for participation in communities without domination rather than mere absence of constraint, so hope involves active participation in God's future breaking into present reality. We don't merely wait for divine intervention; we participate in bringing that intervention into being.

This balanced understanding provides a corrective to both the triumphalism of MAGA Christianism and the resignation sometimes found in progressive circles. Neither "God will restore American greatness regardless of our actions" nor "the forces arrayed against justice are too powerful to overcome" represents authentic theological hope. Both fail to grasp hope's participatory nature—the way it invites our active engagement in bringing about what we hope for.

## False Hope vs. True Hope

Our current political moment offers numerous counterfeits of hope. Toxic positivity demands we ignore problems rather than address them. Triumphalism promises victory without vulnerability. Apocalypticism offers the emotional satisfaction of seeing ourselves on the right side of a cosmic battle without requiring the difficult work of reconciliation.

MAGA Christianism presents a particularly dangerous counterfeit through its apocalyptic framework. By casting political opponents as not just mistaken but evil, it transforms political discourse from participation in common life to warfare against enemies. Its promise that a strongman will restore order appeals precisely because it requires nothing of us except allegiance—the opposite of hope as participatory virtue.

This counterfeit hope manifests in what theologians call "temporal distortion"—orienting toward a mythic past rather than God's future of universal reconciliation. True hope, by contrast, neither idealizes the past nor escapes to an imagined future, but engages faithfully with present reality while working toward greater justice and reconciliation.

Aquinas helps us distinguish between authentic hope and its counterfeits. True hope, he argues, is always directed toward a "difficult good"—something valuable that cannot be easily attained. It requires patience, persistence, and partnership with both divine and human actors. It acknowledges hardship without being defined by it.

In contrast to the primitive biblicism that characterizes the first mutation of MAGA Christianism, theological hope engages scripture not as escape from complexity but as invitation into the messy, ongoing story of God's redemptive work. Biblical narratives offer not simplistic assurances but complex testimony to how God works through human participation to bring about unexpected possibilities.

## Hope in Military Context

My experience at the Naval Academy and on nuclear submarines taught me something about hope that our broader culture has forgotten: how to maintain possibility in desperate situations. Military service often places individuals in circumstances where optimism is impossible, yet hope remains essential for both survival and mission accomplishment.

During submarine deployment exercises, when systems failed and problems compounded, I witnessed how effective leaders distinguished between false hope based on denial and genuine hope grounded in realistic assessment followed by committed action. When a crew faces overwhelming challenges, good officers don't offer false reassurance or surrender to despair. Instead, they acknowledge difficulty while emphasizing capacity for action within constraints.

This balance mirrors theological hope. Like the submarine officer who continues the mission despite awareness of its dangers and limitations, the person formed by Christian hope doesn't deny current reality but refuses to be limited by it. Veterans' experience of "hoping against hope" provides a model for civic engagement in our current moment—clear-eyed about challenges while committed to purpose beyond present circumstances.

This hope stands in stark contrast to the practical atheism that characterizes the second mutation of MAGA Christianism. Rather than replacing Jesus as exemplar with pragmatic politics, military service at its best embodies what Sam Wells calls "being with"—standing alongside others in difficult circumstances rather than attempting to solve problems from a distance or abandoning them as hopeless.

## Practices of Hope as Participation

If hope is virtue rather than mere feeling, how do we practice it? Since hope involves participation in God's future breaking into present reality, it requires concrete practices that form us as hopeful people—disciplines that train us to see and pursue possibility beyond present limitation.

First, we practice hope through rituals of remembrance. When we recall how seemingly insurmountable obstacles have been overcome in the past—from the Civil Rights Movement to the fall of apartheid to local victories for justice in our own communities—we expand our imagination about what might be possible in the present. This isn't naive optimism but disciplined remembering that grounds hope in historical reality.

In one of my parishes, we created a practice called "Hope Stories" where members shared experiences of unexpected transformation in their own lives or communities. These weren't simplistic testimonies but complex narratives of persistence through difficulty. By rehearsing these stories regularly, the congregation developed greater capacity to hope in seemingly hopeless situations.

Second, we practice hope through acts of beauty and justice. When we plant gardens in abandoned lots, create art amid destruction, or build affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods, we aren't simply addressing immediate needs; we're practicing the virtue of hope by acting as if a different future is possible. These aren't mere symbolic gestures but essential disciplines of virtue formation.

During my naval service, I witnessed how seemingly small acts—maintaining uniform standards in crisis, continuing training exercises during deployment challenges, preserving rituals of respect amid exhaustion—functioned as disciplined hope. These practices weren't about denial but about maintaining the habits that would make success possible when conditions improved.

Third, we practice hope through lament that refuses both denial and despair. As we explored in our essay on lament, truthful grieving creates the foundation for authentic hope. By acknowledging real suffering without surrendering to it as final, we create space for unexpected possibility. Hope doesn't circumvent suffering but passes through it.

When my late wife Claudia faced cancer, our parish community demonstrated this practice by creating space for both honesty about the disease's severity and persistent engagement with treatment possibilities. They neither minimized the diagnosis with toxic positivity nor succumbed to fatalistic acceptance. Their truthful presence embodied hope as "being with" rather than either "working for" (trying to fix the unfixable) or "being for" (offering sympathy without participation).

## Communal Practices of Hope

Wells emphasizes that hope cannot be sustained individually but requires community. Like all theological virtues, hope flourishes in context of shared practice and mutual encouragement. When my hope falters, I borrow yours; when yours diminishes, you draw from mine.

In submarine service, I learned how crew members sustained each other's hope during crisis. When one sailor became overwhelmed by a problem's complexity, another would step in with fresh perspective. This wasn't blind optimism but mutual support in maintaining both realism about challenges and commitment to addressing them.

Worship itself functions as rehearsal of an alternative reality—what theologian Walter Brueggemann calls "prophetic imagination." When we gather to proclaim God's kingdom amid empirical evidence of its absence, we practice hope as commitment rather than conclusion. The liturgical imagination—acting as if God's promises were already fulfilled—trains us for civic imagination that works toward justice before its arrival.

The Eucharist particularly forms us in hope by inviting our participation in Christ's death and resurrection. By remembering Christ's sacrifice while celebrating his victory, we learn to hold together both present suffering and future redemption—the essential tension that defines authentic hope.

Intergenerational connections provide vital resources for hope. In my parish work, intentional mentoring relationships between older and younger members created powerful hope formation. When elders shared stories of surviving previous national crises, they provided context that challenged young people's tendency toward despair. When youth offered fresh vision unconstrained by adult resignation, they reinvigorated elders' capacity for imagination. Together, these perspectives created time horizons that extended beyond immediate political cycles.

## Hope as Political Resistance

In our current polarized environment, hope functions not merely as personal consolation but as political resistance. To hope is to reject both complacency with injustice and cynicism about change. It is to act "as if" reconciliation were possible while acknowledging the difficult path toward it.

We see this resistance in communities that refuse both MAGA Christianism's binary apocalypticism and progressive despair. The church in rural Appalachia that created dialogue across political divisions without minimizing real disagreements. The interfaith coalition that maintained relationship with both police and protesters during racial justice demonstrations. The veterans' group that helped conservative community members welcome Afghan refugees through relationship rather than political argument.

These examples embody what theologian William Cavanaugh calls "political hope"—neither the expectation that politics will save us nor the abandonment of political engagement, but rather faithful participation in political life without making it ultimate. Such hope resists both idolatry of political power and withdrawal from political responsibility.

The participatory freedom we've developed throughout these essays finds concrete expression in this political hope. Just as freedom means capacity to participate in communities without domination rather than mere absence of constraint, so hope means active participation in bringing about the future we desire rather than passive waiting for its arrival.

As we stand at what feels like twilight for American democracy, theological hope offers neither false dawn nor surrender to night, but rather the commitment to kindle lamps that will illuminate our path regardless of how long darkness persists. It is not certainty that things will improve but conviction that lighting these lamps matters regardless of outcome.

## From Hope to Love

Hope directs us toward its fulfillment in love. As Aquinas understood, the theological virtues form an integrated whole: faith provides the foundation, hope creates the horizon, and love fulfills both. Without love, hope remains incomplete—oriented toward future good without fully embodying present good.

Our exploration of hope thus leads naturally to our culminating virtue—love itself. For if hope means participating in God's future breaking into present reality, love means participating in God's very nature as self-giving communion. The practices of hope prepare us for the practices of love that form the heart of both personal transformation and political renewal.

In our final essay, we'll explore how love fulfills our journey through these virtues—not as emotional sentiment but as concrete practice of participation in divine reality. For ultimate hope lies not in political victory or cultural dominance, but in love's capacity to create community across our deepest differences—community that participates in God's own trinitarian life of mutual recognition without domination.
