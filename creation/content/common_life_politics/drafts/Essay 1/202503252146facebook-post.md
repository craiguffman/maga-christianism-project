# Bullshit: Understanding MAGA Christianism's Truthfulness Problem

A conversation with my friend Derek about our current political moment led me back to philosopher Harry Frankfurt's work on love and bullshit—insights with new urgency today.

These reflections sharpened when I heard about someone who, while abusing his wife, dismissed truth-telling: "It doesn't matter if you lie if it works."

This statement reveals the philosophical underpinnings of what we've observed in certain strains of MAGA Christianism—a fundamental disordering of love that merits theological examination.

Frankfurt argues that love creates necessity in our lives—establishing what we value and shaping identity. When properly ordered, love binds us to truth because we care deeply about reality.

But MAGA Christianism reflects what Hauerwas identified in Niebuhr—a commitment not to Christian truth, but to philosophical pragmatism. This "practical atheism" replaces Jesus as exemplar with pragmatic politics where effectiveness trumps truth.

The bullshitter, unlike the liar, has no concern for truth. This indifference characterizes much discourse in MAGA Christianism—biblical verses ripped from context, theological concepts repurposed for political ends, verifiable falsehoods circulated without correction.

This approach reveals not just tactical dishonesty but spiritual disorder—turning from participation in God's truth toward the idolatry of effectiveness.
