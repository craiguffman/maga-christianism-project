# Freedom: The Capacity to Love

Many Americans embrace a conception of freedom that would have been foreign to both the church fathers and the American founders. This libertarian ideal—freedom as non-interference—has become so embedded in our cultural imagination that we rarely question it. "Just leave me alone" has become the rallying cry for many, especially those drawn to the hyper-individualism championed by tech visionaries or the distorted Christianity of the MAGA movement.

But this conception of freedom is fundamentally mistaken, both theologically and politically. It represents not the culmination of Christian or American thought but a profound distortion of both traditions.

## Freedom Distorted

When we reduce freedom to mere non-interference, we embrace a fundamentally impoverished understanding that diminishes rather than enhances our humanity. This conception of freedom—what philosopher Philip Pettit calls "freedom as non-interference"—fails to recognize how power operates in the absence of direct coercion.

After Reconstruction, white Southerners (including my ancestors in Louisiana) could claim they weren't actively interfering with Black citizens' freedom while creating structures that effectively denied their ability to participate in society as equals. No one was explicitly "interfering" with their voting rights—there were just literacy tests, poll taxes, and white primaries that "happened" to exclude them.

The same pattern continues today. When we reduce freedom to mere non-interference, we blind ourselves to how economic arrangements and social structures enable domination without direct coercion. We miss how systems inherited from our segregated past—from housing policy to educational funding to criminal justice—continue to shape our present.

## Freedom Reconsidered

When we reason from first principles about the Trinity, we discover that true freedom isn't the absence of constraints but the presence of capacity—specifically, the capacity to love God and neighbor with our whole being. The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-5), which Jesus identifies as the greatest commandment alongside loving one's neighbor, doesn't present love as optional but as constitutive of what it means to be human. Freedom, then, is the capacity to fulfill this calling without hindrance.

As I explored with Douglas Campbell in our conversations about freedom, this understanding reframes the entire concept. Freedom isn't a space or zone free from interference; it's the positive capacity to love fully. Campbell explains this as movement away from a "quasi-freedom" that excludes relationship toward genuine freedom that emerges precisely through right relationship.

The freedom proclaimed in the Gospels isn't about individual autonomy but about liberation from domination. Christ's ministry consistently confronted systems that diminished human flourishing—whether Roman imperial power, religious hypocrisy, or social marginalization. His resurrection represents God's definitive rejection of domination in all its forms.

## Freedom as Non-Domination

This theological understanding aligns closely with the civic republican tradition that shaped much of our nation's founding before being corrupted by white supremacy and market fundamentalism. Philip Pettit's articulation of "freedom as non-domination" provides a helpful framework that bridges theological and political understanding.

Freedom as non-domination doesn't focus merely on actual interference but on the capacity for arbitrary interference. I am unfree not only when you actively interfere with my choices, but when you have the power to interfere arbitrarily, even if you choose not to exercise it. The slave with a benevolent master who rarely interferes remains unfree because interference remains a constant possibility.

This understanding reshapes how we evaluate democratic institutions. The question isn't simply whether government interferes with individual choices, but whether institutions protect citizens from domination—both from government itself and from other sources of power (economic, social, religious).

Veterans understand this distinction intuitively. Military service at its best embodies freedom as non-domination—creating structures where power is accountable and oriented toward common flourishing rather than personal advantage. The military oath to "support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic" represents commitment to principles that prevent domination, not merely pledge to follow orders.

## The Capacity to Love

Stanley Hauerwas deepens this understanding by emphasizing that Christian freedom is fundamentally the capacity to love—to give ourselves fully to God and neighbor without the constraints that sin imposes. This isn't abstract theology but practical reality: our capacity to love is diminished by both external domination and internal bondage.

External domination—whether political oppression, economic exploitation, or social marginalization—creates conditions where the full expression of love becomes difficult or impossible. Internal bondage—pride, fear, prejudice, addiction—similarly constrains our capacity to love fully. True freedom addresses both dimensions.

This understanding transforms political engagement. The question isn't simply whether government leaves individuals alone but whether social arrangements enhance or diminish our collective capacity to love. Does our healthcare system enable or prevent care for the vulnerable? Do our economic structures facilitate mutual flourishing or exploitation? Do our immigration policies honor human dignity or dehumanize the stranger?

## Freedom in Worship

In our worship as people of faith, we practice a different understanding of freedom. The Eucharist forms us as a community where status and wealth hold no privilege, where all are equally recipients of grace. This liturgical formation isn't separate from political witness but fundamentally shapes it. We learn freedom not as isolated individuals but as members of Christ's body.

Richard Hooker, in his defense of Anglicanism against both Roman authoritarianism and Puritan biblicism, reasoned from Trinity to society, showing how proper theological understanding shapes political imagination. Like Hooker, we must recover theological reasoning that begins with God's nature rather than with market logic or nationalist identity.

## From False Freedom to True Freedom

My own journey from libertarian individualism to a more relational understanding of freedom required painfully acknowledging truths about my family's history in Louisiana and my own complicity in systems of privilege. This duty to truth precedes all other duties because without it, we cannot know what true faithfulness requires.

For those who value service and sacrifice, this understanding of freedom should resonate more deeply than libertarian individualism. True freedom requires more than being left alone—it demands institutions and practices that empower all people to flourish as bearers of God's image. It requires challenging economic arrangements that concentrate power in ways that enable domination. It means confronting how Christian symbols have been co-opted to defend hierarchies that Christ came to overturn.

Freedom as the capacity to love offers a path beyond the false choice between progressive identity politics and reactionary nationalism. It recovers both theological wisdom and civic republican principles that can address our current crisis without capitulating to either market fundamentalism or state control.

## Toward Justice

The question for us is whether we have the courage to reimagine freedom not as escape from obligation but as capacity for love—love of God and neighbor that liberates us all from domination and invites us into God's redemptive work in the world.

This understanding of freedom leads naturally to questions of justice. If freedom means the capacity to love God and neighbor fully, then justice must involve creating conditions where this capacity can flourish for all people. As we'll explore next, genuine justice emerges at the intersection of love, power, and mercy—precisely the place where freedom as capacity for love finds its fullest expression.
