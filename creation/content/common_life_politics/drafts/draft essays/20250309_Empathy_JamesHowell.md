The Gospel reading is Luke 10 beginning
0:03
with the 25th
0:04
verse and behold a lawyer stood up to
0:07
put him to the test saying teacher what
0:10
shall I do to inherit eternal life he
0:13
said to him what is written in the law
0:16
how do you
0:17
read and he answered you shall love the
0:20
Lord with all your heart and with all
0:22
your soul and with all your strength and
0:24
with all your mind and your neighbor as
0:26
yourself and he said to him you have
0:29
answered right do this and you will live
0:32
but he Desiring to justify himself said
0:35
to Jesus and who is my neighbor Jesus
0:38
replied A man was going down from
0:40
Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among
0:42
robbers who stripped him and beat him
0:45
and departed leaving him half
0:47
dead now by chance a priest was going
0:50
down that road and when he saw him he
0:52
passed by on the other
0:54
side so likewise a levite when he came
0:57
to the place and saw him passed by on
1:00
the other side but a Samaritan as he
1:03
journeyed came to where he was and
1:06
pouring on oil and wine then he set him
1:08
on his own beast and brought him to an
1:10
end and took care of him and the next
1:13
day he took out two dinar and gave them
1:15
to the inkeeper saying take care of him
1:18
and whatever more you spend I will repay
1:20
you when I come back which of these
1:23
three do you think proved neighbor to
1:25
the man who fell among the robbers he
1:27
said the one who showed Mercy on him and
1:30
Jesus said go and do
1:32
likewise now as they went on their way
1:34
he entered a village and a woman named
1:36
Martha received him into her house and
1:40
she had a sister called Mary who sat at
1:42
the Lord's feet and listened to his
1:44
teaching but Martha was distracted with
1:46
much serving and she went to him and
1:49
said Lord do you not care that my sister
1:51
has left me to serve alone tell her then
1:54
to help me but the Lord answered her
1:57
Martha Martha you are anxious and
1:59
troubled about many things one thing is
2:01
needful Mary has chosen the good portion
2:04
which shall not be taken away from her
2:06
this is the word of God for the people
2:08
of God thanks be to
2:18
God quit thank you for that uh
2:22
reading I really admire uh Luke's genius
2:26
his inspiration I don't know what in
2:28
stitching together
2:30
uh these various moments from Jesus life
2:33
he's done all this research he's
2:34
gathered it and then he puts it together
2:36
for us and I love in this case uh the
2:39
conversation with the lawyer you wonder
2:41
it like in ancient times did they have
2:43
lawyer jokes is this the equivalent of
2:45
the lawyer joke Jesus always has his way
2:48
with the lawyers right has the
2:50
conversation with the lawyer and the
2:52
lawyer answers rightly that what what
2:54
what scripture is about is love God love
2:58
neighbor and then Luke in his Artistry
3:01
he he then explains what love of
3:02
neighbor looks like the story of the
3:04
Good Samaritan and then he gets to what
3:06
love of God looks like in the story uh
3:10
of Mary and Martha so lovely uh the Mary
3:14
thing there's something in that for
3:15
women I think you know in those days
3:18
rabbis would travel and they would come
3:20
to homes and the men would gather at the
3:22
feet of the rabbi and the women would do
3:24
what Martha was doing staying in the
3:25
kitchen tending to the meal for the men
3:29
Mary violates custom and she's sitting
3:31
at the feet of the rabbi and and
3:34
Martha's upset about it but Jesus
3:36
Praises her she chose the better part
3:38
that's part of what it is to love right
3:40
is to
3:43
listen to listen we can actually reverse
3:46
these stories and think about them
3:48
differently you know the Good Samaritan
3:50
story like prend to think well that's a
3:53
story that means like you should be nice
3:54
if somebody's having a hard time it's
3:56
way more than that we'll get back to it
3:58
but one of the ways to think think about
4:00
it is to ask the question when when have
4:03
you felt like the one beaten up and left
4:06
by the side of the
4:09
road if you're one of those naive people
4:11
that have never had that feeling I can
4:13
say just give it some time it'll come
4:16
sometimes you we're hurting and just no
4:18
no one knows no one understands you feel
4:21
the pressure to go out in public and
4:23
smile and how are you doing I'm fine we
4:25
do that but I actually feel beaten up
4:27
and left and will somebody help me and
4:29
what we know is that Jesus God is like
4:32
that Good Samaritan bending down loving
4:36
healing and then Mary I mean how how
4:38
much love is there in God in Jesus that
4:43
that he speaks to Mary how much love is
4:46
there in that God God speaks to us we
4:48
may think well I I don't hear God and
4:50
that may be more a function of like you
4:52
you're just busy we're in a noisy
4:54
environment all the time A lot of times
4:57
we don't hear God speaking because we
4:59
have our own kind of preconceptions of
5:02
what's good in the world and it's hard
5:04
to hear that God might actually be
5:07
somewhere else how loving of God to
5:11
speak to us to reach down and heal us
5:13
how how how loving is it that God ask of
5:17
us not intimidation or fear but God asks
5:22
for love love I love that God asks for
5:27
love the lawyer ask uh the question and
5:30
he answers rightly Jesus says you've
5:31
answered rightly and I bet he was proud
5:33
at first yes I'm a high achiever that's
5:35
how I've achieved the station in life
5:38
but but then I wonder if he got nervous
5:40
uh because soon after that he asked
5:42
Jesus well who is my neighbor Luke says
5:45
he was trying to justify himself the the
5:48
lawyer we assume thought that that his
5:50
neighbor was something that he had a
5:52
neighbor his neighbor was someone who
5:54
was near him someone who was like him
5:56
someone who was deserving someone else
5:58
who was a high achiever
6:00
in the world Jesus responds though not
6:03
by upgrading him no I want to correct
6:05
you instead Jesus just tells a story
6:07
Jesus is always that way he gives a
6:10
story you kind of find your own place
6:13
and space in it it's a great story Jesus
6:17
says that a man was going down from
6:19
Jerusalem to Jericho and if you ever
6:21
come with me to the Holy Land man is it
6:24
down in the course of 18 miles you go
6:27
from I think it's about 25 00 ft above
6:30
sea level to 800 ft below sea level I
6:34
mean this is a steep descent I remember
6:37
years ago I had a group there we're in a
6:39
bus my daughter Sarah was with me she
6:40
was 8 years old and we stopped about
6:43
halfway to Jericho at the end of the
6:45
Good Samaritan and there was a camel
6:47
there and Sarah wanted to have her photo
6:48
taken with the camel so all my church
6:51
people of course obligatory you have to
6:52
take a photo of the pastor's daughter so
6:54
everybody lifted their camera and just
6:56
as they snapped it they did not actually
6:58
get a photo of my lovely daughter
7:01
smiling next to the camel instead just
7:03
as they were snapping the Camel had made
7:06
a really bad decision and that was to
7:08
bend down and bite my daughter on the
7:12
head there was weeping and wailing and
7:15
nashing of teeth and a lot of blood very
7:18
exciting what happened to Jesus man on
7:20
the way down from Jerusalem Jericho was
7:23
worse there were some robbers who came
7:25
and they beat him up and they stole his
7:27
stuff they didn't just do that they also
7:29
stripped him and humiliated him and left
7:34
him for dead and two holy men come along
7:38
as a priest and then a levite and they I
7:40
guess they subscribe to I think the
7:42
thing that Dietrich Bon hoofer talked
7:44
about boner says that sometimes we think
7:46
that God wants us to be good God wants
7:48
us to keep our hands clean he said but
7:51
actually what God wants us to do is to
7:52
get our hands dirty doing God's work in
7:55
the world they don't get their hands
7:56
dirty maybe they set a prayer as they go
7:58
by we have no
8:00
idea then the Samaritan comes along the
8:03
Samaritan this is not just a nice guy
8:06
you have to hear this he was far from
8:09
home he would have been despised by the
8:13
priest he would have been despised by
8:15
that levite he would have been despised
8:17
by everybody listening to Jesus's story
8:19
he would have been despised by the very
8:22
guy that he bends down and help I had
8:24
this amazing thing that happened to me
8:26
my first year or two in the ministry we
8:28
had a woman went in the hospital hospit
8:30
and I went to visit her she was really
8:32
sick and um you know she was kind of old
8:36
school racist you know I'd be there and
8:39
she'd say oh I hate it I had a black
8:41
nurse last night I hate it when there's
8:42
a black nurse I wish all the nurses were
8:45
white oh gosh and I kept seeing her she
8:48
would come she was so sick I didn't want
8:50
to get in her face about it so I let it
8:52
go but she just kept getting worse and
8:54
worse over about 10 or 11 days they
8:56
could not figure out what's wrong with
8:58
her and they finally her em was
8:59
gathering thinking we're near last
9:01
rights on her I mean she's just they
9:03
can't what is wrong so I happened to be
9:07
with her one day and you could see out
9:09
in the hall the doctor about to come in
9:11
and he was black and she rolled her eyes
9:14
and said oh God now it's a black
9:18
doctor the doctor came in the room had
9:22
the clipboard glanced at her and within
9:24
30 seconds said ma'am you have
9:26
tuberculosis
9:30
he was from Nigeria he'd seen it a lot
9:33
and everybody else had missed it so it
9:37
was the man that she
9:39
despised who cured her it was the man
9:42
she
9:43
despised who saved her life that's
9:45
what's going on with the Samaritan thing
9:47
and I used to preach on this when I was
9:48
younger and I was think well what's the
9:50
modern equivalent of the Samaritan and I
9:52
think back in the 80s I was say it's the
9:54
person with AIDS oh my today you could
9:56
say it's those Republicans or oh it's
9:58
those Democrats oh it's those immigrants
10:00
whoever it is that gets on your nerves
10:02
that you just can't
10:04
manage I thought about this all week and
10:07
I wanted to think about the
10:10
Samaritan in light of uh there's a word
10:13
that came up in the news this week and
10:15
it's not a word I recall ever Hearing in
10:17
the news but it was big in the news this
10:20
week and that word excuse me that word
10:24
is
10:26
empathy
10:28
empathy there there was a very powerful
10:30
public official who was interviewed on
10:32
The Joe Rogan show I've never I don't
10:35
even know what that is it's not a show
10:36
I've heard or seen or whatever uh but I
10:39
got the manuscript and read it and and
10:42
this powerful public figure has a a
10:45
great
10:46
disdain for empathy says empathy is the
10:50
great weakness in our culture empathy is
10:53
really damaging to our economy just want
10:55
on a rant against empathy and let's be
10:58
clear if he had not done that nothing
11:00
would be different this is a bipartisan
11:02
thing in
11:04
America empathy is in Decline it just is
11:08
back in the day empathy was a thing and
11:10
everyone honored it but now people just
11:12
aren't so
11:14
sure about empathy and we live in a
11:17
democracy so in a democracy America can
11:20
we can become whoever we want to be
11:22
50.1% of the vote we we'll be whatever
11:24
that is so we could as a country decide
11:27
empathy is not a thing for us anymore
11:29
but I pray that that does not happen
11:32
because as a historian I would say that
11:34
would make us uh untrue to the founding
11:38
fathers who cared about empathy and
11:41
thought we would be an empathetic people
11:43
and to so many great Americans through
11:47
history more importantly we're not here
11:49
to think of ourselves as Americans today
11:51
we're we're we're the church we're the
11:54
followers of Jesus
11:56
Jesus no one ever
11:59
had more empathy than Jesus Jesus was
12:03
empathy incarnate and if we are his
12:06
followers the church can church can
12:08
never surrender or back off an inch from
12:11
empathy it is our cardinal virtue it is
12:14
our mission if we cease if we back up on
12:17
empathy at all we cease being a church
12:18
like let's just pack up and go home if
12:21
empathy isn't our thing and we're called
12:24
by God not just I'm going to be an
12:25
empathetic person that seems nice but
12:27
God actually calls us to lead to be
12:31
ambassadors to be
12:33
evangelicals to expect ourselves our
12:37
friends our family our neighbors our
12:40
companies the cities we live in and even
12:43
our
12:44
government to be about
12:48
empathy there's a lot going on in our
12:50
country right now and as best I can tell
12:53
about half the people are cheering
12:55
what's going on and about half the
12:57
people are moaning what what's going on
13:00
I would say to you whether you cheer or
13:03
moan let's be clear that if we're
13:06
followers of Jesus our question is
13:10
always who's been beaten up and left by
13:12
the side of the
13:13
road who's been it's not who's right
13:16
politically but who's been beaten up and
13:18
left by the side of the road and that's
13:21
where our attention goes and it's where
13:23
we get our hands dirty whether you're
13:26
cheering or moaning what we have to know
13:28
is that there are many hardworking
13:30
people in this country who are being
13:34
fired and I know people that cheer that
13:37
and people that lament that were
13:40
concerned about those as Christians who
13:42
were beaten up and left by the side of
13:44
the road I had a NE I have a niece named
13:47
Katie she was fired this week uh her job
13:51
interestingly is to pick up people that
13:53
are beaten up and left by the side of
13:56
the road her job she works at yosot
13:59
anymore she works at yosee National Park
14:02
she works in search and rescue so what
14:05
happens is Garden variety Americans like
14:07
us go to a place like yede and people
14:09
fall and they break uh a leg or they
14:12
have a heart attack or they get lost on
14:15
a path or they take a tumble whatever it
14:17
is that happens and if that happens you
14:20
actually need somebody like Katie she's
14:21
a mountain climber she's a medic she
14:23
knows how to find you in the woods and
14:26
save your life but now she's been Ked to
14:29
the curb and it's not just that she lost
14:31
her job which didn't pay much to begin
14:33
with her home was in yed National Park
14:38
so she has lost not just her job but her
14:41
home we're concerned we ask who's been
14:44
beaten
14:45
up and left by the side of the road let
14:48
me tiptoe into a couple of other things
14:50
be patient with
14:52
me Ukraine has been much in the news
14:55
lately and I know Americans who cheer
14:58
Don Donald Trump on this and I know
15:00
Americans who cheer
15:02
zalinski on this I actually heard um the
15:05
other day David
15:07
Brooks he's so interesting if you're
15:09
liberal you think he's a conservative
15:11
and if you're a conservative you think
15:12
he's a liberal like that's probably to
15:14
his credit right David Brooks the other
15:17
day was reflecting on the US vote in the
15:22
UN in favor of Russia and against
15:26
Ukraine he said when I heard that I felt
15:32
moral shame I don't think I felt moral
15:36
shame what I felt when I saw that I felt
15:39
kind of um
15:41
concussed if you will I grew up as as
15:44
was a little boy who lived on an Air
15:46
Force Base My father flew for our
15:49
country in the Air Force and he flew
15:52
this is so interesting flew in the
15:53
Berlin
15:54
airlift and he flew in the Cuban Missile
15:58
Crisis
15:59
so I remember taking Pride as a kid I
16:02
still do have that Pride that my father
16:05
was part of an effort to push back
16:09
against Russian
16:12
aggression we in the church though we
16:16
ask who's been beaten up and left by the
16:18
side of the road instead of just getting
16:21
shrill
16:22
politically and in the this case we know
16:25
who they are because we have sent
16:26
Mission teams and I've been there also
16:28
to to the border between Poland and
16:32
Ukraine and who we've seen there are
16:34
ukrainians whose homes were bombed out
16:37
whose husbands were killed in the early
16:39
phases of the battle they've come across
16:42
the border and they're being housed in
16:45
Methodist churches in
16:48
Poland we ask who's been beaten up and
16:51
left by the side of the road here's one
16:53
more thing this is really delicate
16:55
territory but stick with
16:57
me this sounds political but it's not
17:00
political at all and I'll explain why
17:03
Jesus is all about healing that makes me
17:07
tiptoe up to the edge of thinking about
17:10
health care I have no
17:12
expertise in public health care I didn't
17:15
study that in school I've read a little
17:16
bit I don't know much I'm no smarter
17:18
than anybody else on it so I don't
17:20
really know how but how all that stuff
17:23
works what I have lately noticed though
17:27
is Healthcare actually is a thing that
17:29
matters to me
17:30
professionally it's not just something I
17:32
read about in the paper when you guys
17:34
get sick when you're on the hospital you
17:38
call
17:39
me you call Laura and we come to the
17:43
hospital and we pray with you and we
17:47
love you and we hear you when you say
17:48
things like the insurance may not pay
17:51
for this I'm not only sick I'm going to
17:52
be broke when all this stuff that just
17:54
goes on and and we we love you when
17:56
you're sick so it's part of my work
17:59
is to love those who are sick so the
18:01
question that I have and I'm sure
18:02
someone can answer this easily and I
18:05
won't be confused any longer but the
18:07
question that I have is how how do
18:11
spending cuts how do cuts in protective
18:17
measures how do cuts in medical research
18:22
make me
18:23
healthier or I'm sorry that's the wrong
18:27
question to ask I'm not worried about me
18:31
because I've got money and I've got
18:33
connections if I get sick I can text my
18:37
doctor and they snap two and they'll do
18:39
for me it it's not about me it's about
18:43
the people that Jesus seem to be
18:44
concerned about and those are actually
18:45
the most vulnerable the people who they
18:47
can never text the doctor and they don't
18:49
actually have money Jesus seems just
18:51
bent on the healing of the the the
18:53
people that nobody likes that nobody
18:56
understands that they don't have
18:57
standing the
18:59
they're like a Samaritan there are the
19:01
people that hate the Samaritans Jesus in
19:05
his
19:06
vision Jesus concerned about their
19:09
Wellness Jesus the most empathetic
19:11
person ever Arthur Brooks different
19:14
Brooks right spoke of the National
19:17
Prayer Breakfast a few years back and I
19:19
love his phrase and I think it's God's
19:21
call not just to our country but us in
19:23
the church he said we are to be
19:26
missionaries for love in the face of
19:30
contempt I think that's what God asks of
19:32
us I don't care where you are
19:33
politically it doesn't matter as
19:36
Christians we are called to be
19:37
missionaries for
19:39
love in the face of contempt I read a
19:43
French Theologian this week Paul rur
19:45
he's
19:46
died he was great he was reflecting on
19:49
this passage and he thought you know the
19:52
the lawyer thought I I have a neighbor I
19:55
have neighbors RoR says that for Jesus
19:58
it's not that you have a neighbor it's
20:01
that he asked us to make a
20:05
neighbor you don't have a neighbor you
20:08
make a neighbor and the neighbor is not
20:11
the obvious person and the neighbor may
20:13
be somebody you just don't understand or
20:15
that you don't even like and they don't
20:17
even like you you
20:18
make you make a neighbor you make a
20:21
neighbor or of what GK chesterson wrote
20:25
about St
20:26
Francis he said uh Francis seemed to
20:29
have liked
20:30
everybody but especially those other
20:33
people disliked him for
20:37
liking do you like anybody that others
20:41
dislike you for liking them let me close
20:44
this kind of apology at the end least
20:47
and I recently have been reading uh
20:49
these kind of mystery novels by this guy
20:51
named Peter Granger they're really good
20:53
and they're about this investigator in
20:55
England named DC Smith and he you know
20:58
he finds all the criminals he's great
21:00
and his rules in his work and for his
21:03
assistant his rules are assume nothing
21:06
check everything this is one of the
21:09
things that goes wrong with us by the
21:10
way in terms of understanding what God
21:12
wants us to be about we assume certain
21:16
things but DCC says assume nothing check
21:21
everything you hear me up here talking
21:24
today and you know if I am wrong
21:28
trust me on this I have been wrong so
21:31
many times in my life I've just gotten
21:33
used to
21:34
it and I've been wrong so many times
21:37
that I've actually gotten to the point
21:39
that when I'm wrong and somebody tells
21:41
me how I'm wrong I'm so happy CU I don't
21:44
want to be wrong I don't want to be
21:46
stupid I want to be on top of things I
21:48
want to learn I want to grow so check
21:51
things don't assume anything and if I if
21:53
I've
21:55
misread God this morning God please tell
21:58
tell me please tell me I'm giving you my
22:01
best read of what I can understand about
22:04
Jesus it's related to this this other
22:06
thing Lisa and this is interesting she's
22:09
not here now I can talk about
22:10
her Lisa and I last week turned
22:14
39 we turned to 39 you know people get
22:17
to 39 and they say I'm 39 and holding I
22:19
don't think I'm going to hold I think
22:20
next year I'll say we made
22:22
40 and there's a funny thing about this
22:26
woman that I have been married to for 39
22:28
9 years you would think after that
22:31
period of time that I would kind
22:34
of understand
22:38
her but lo and behold and I've been
22:41
working at it for 39 years I've been
22:43
asking questions I've been listening
22:46
I've been doing my dead level best and
22:47
there's some things I know and
22:49
understand that I didn't 20 years ago or
22:51
18 I what but she there's just all the
22:54
time it's just something I'm like what
22:56
who what and and I've got a learned
22:58
something new about her that I did not
23:00
know before or there things I thought I
23:03
knew and just I didn't get it right or I
23:06
kind of got it half right but there was
23:08
other stuff I
23:10
didn't understand and and that Quest is
23:14
what we call
23:17
love when you love you don't think I got
23:20
this person figured out I had her
23:21
figured out by year
23:23
four but no when you love you keep
23:27
listening you keep learning you keep
23:31
probing Jesus says God wants
23:35
love and if you think you got God all
23:38
figured out that's not as it turns out
23:42
love God wants us to assume
23:46
nothing assume
23:48
nothing check
23:51
everything ask what are we really to be
23:54
about here I've got my biases I've got
23:57
my pet ideas is but what are you really
23:59
asking of us Lord I'm pretty darn sure
24:04
that empathy is at the heart of it all
24:08
and getting our hands
24:09
dirty for those who've been beaten up
24:12
and left by the side of the
24:15
road and I love that that's the
24:18
case thanks be to God
