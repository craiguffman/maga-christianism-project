# Beyond Empathy: When Emotional Resonance Substitutes For Justice

Several years ago, while teaching at the Naval Academy, I attended a lecture by a visiting scholar who argued that cultivating empathy was the key to solving our nation's social divisions. During the Q&A, a midshipman raised his hand and asked, "But sir, what do we do when empathy fails? What if I try my hardest to understand someone's perspective, but I just can't feel what they feel?"

The scholar's response was memorable for its inadequacy: "Just keep trying. Everyone can develop empathy with enough effort."

I watched the midshipman's face fall. As someone preparing to lead in complex environments where lives would depend on his decisions, he needed more than this therapeutic bromide. The exchange has stayed with me as an example of how our contemporary emphasis on empathy, while well-intentioned, often fails precisely where we need it most.

## The Limits of Emotional Resonance

Empathy, in its most common contemporary usage, refers to emotional resonance—the ability to feel what another person feels. This capacity for shared emotion undoubtedly represents an important human faculty and can motivate compassionate action. But as philosopher Jesse Prinz and others have argued, empathy suffers from serious limitations as a moral guide.

First, empathy functions as a spotlight, focusing intensely on individuals while leaving systems in darkness. We can empathize with the suffering child we see before us, but not with the thousands affected by policies we'll never witness directly. This creates what psychologist Paul Bloom calls the "spotlight effect," where empathic responses favor the visible and immediate over the distant and systemic.

Second, empathy is inherently biased. We naturally empathize more easily with those who look, think, and act like us. Research consistently demonstrates that empathic responses are stronger for in-group members, making empathy a potentially divisive rather than unifying force in diverse communities.

Third, empathy is easily manipulated by narrative. Skilled storytellers can evoke powerful empathic responses regardless of the objective severity of suffering or the factual basis of claims. This makes empathy vulnerable to exploitation by those who craft the most compelling narratives rather than those who speak the most important truths.

Finally, empathy is exhausting. The psychological literature on "empathy fatigue" and "compassion burnout" reveals how emotional resonance depletes cognitive resources, leading to disengagement precisely when moral attention is most needed.

## MAGA Christianism's Empathy Problem

These limitations of empathy are particularly evident in MAGA Christianism's approach to moral and political questions. The movement demonstrates both empathic excess and empathic deficit—feeling too much in some contexts and too little in others.

MAGA Christianism's empathic spotlight shines intensely on certain constituencies—rural communities facing economic hardship, business owners navigating regulations, parents concerned about educational content. These concerns deserve serious moral attention. Yet the movement often fails to extend similar moral concern to others—refugees, religious minorities, LGBTQ+ persons, or racial justice advocates.

This selective empathy reflects what we've identified as "primitive biblicism"—a hermeneutical approach that claims direct, unmediated access to scriptural meaning while bypassing interpretive traditions that might challenge one's empathic biases. By selectively empathizing with some biblical narratives while overlooking others, this approach reinforces rather than challenges existing empathic limitations.

The movement demonstrates how empathy, untethered from broader moral principles, serves to justify rather than transform existing affiliations. When empathy becomes the primary measure of moral concern, those beyond our empathic reach effectively disappear from moral consideration.

## From Empathy to Moral Imagination

What's needed is not more empathy but greater moral imagination—the capacity to consider others as full participants in a moral community even when empathic resonance fails. This moral imagination doesn't require feeling what others feel; it requires recognizing their inherent dignity and rightful place in the community regardless of emotional connection.

Unlike empathy, moral imagination isn't primarily about emotional resonance but about expanded moral vision. It asks us to see others as bearing God's image even when their experiences remain opaque to us. It calls us to act justly toward those with whom we share no emotional connection. It demands that we recognize others' full participation in human community even when their lives seem incomprehensible to us.

Christian tradition offers rich resources for developing this moral imagination. The parable of the Good Samaritan, for instance, doesn't require empathic understanding between Samaritan and victim—it requires recognition of the victim's claim to care despite traditional boundaries. Paul's vision of the body of Christ doesn't depend on members feeling alike but on recognizing their interconnection despite differences.

## Freedom as Participation Without Domination

This moral imagination connects directly to our understanding of freedom as participation without domination. True freedom doesn't require that I emotionally resonate with your experience; it requires that I recognize your right to participate fully in our common life without being subject to my arbitrary power.

This participatory understanding stands in contrast to MAGA Christianism's frequent emphasis on freedom from interference. When freedom is understood primarily as non-interference, empathy becomes the only bridge to moral concern for others—I must feel your pain to recognize your claim. But when freedom is understood as non-domination, your moral claim exists regardless of my emotional response—it arises from your rightful participation in our shared community.

The young midshipman's question deserves a better answer than the visiting scholar provided. When empathy fails—and it will fail across certain boundaries of experience—moral imagination must take its place. We need not feel what others feel to recognize their rightful participation in our moral community.

This doesn't mean abandoning empathy entirely. Emotional resonance remains a powerful motivator for moral action. But it does mean recognizing empathy's limitations and supplementing it with moral principles that transcend emotional response. It means developing what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called "disciplined compassion"—moral concern guided by principle rather than merely by feeling.

## Beyond Therapeutic Politics

Our political discourse has increasingly adopted the language of therapy, with empathy serving as its central virtue. We're encouraged to "feel the pain" of various constituencies, with politicians' capacity for emotional resonance treated as a primary qualification for leadership.

This therapeutic approach to politics reaches its apotheosis in certain strains of MAGA Christianism, where emotional authenticity often trumps factual accuracy, and where empathic connection with some groups justifies dismissal of others. When politics becomes primarily about whose pain deserves recognition, we lose sight of the common good that transcends particular experiences.

What we need instead is a politics grounded in the recognition of each person's rightful participation in our common life—a politics that acknowledges both the reality of different lived experiences and the moral claims that exist independent of our emotional response to those experiences.

For Christian communities, this means recovering a theological anthropology that sees each person's dignity as deriving not from their capacity to evoke our empathy but from their status as bearers of God's image. It means developing forms of political engagement that move beyond emotional resonance to recognize others' rightful participation regardless of whether we can "feel their pain."

The Naval Academy midshipman's question points us toward a more robust moral framework than mere empathy can provide. In a diverse democracy, we will inevitably encounter experiences we cannot fully understand and perspectives we cannot fully share. The moral challenge isn't to force emotional resonance across these boundaries but to recognize others' full participation in our moral community despite these limitations.
