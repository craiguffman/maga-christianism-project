# Empathy: More Than a Feeling

[OPENING: Speaker directly facing camera, simple background]

Hey, there's a word that's been getting a bad rap lately: Empathy.

Some powerful people are calling it a weakness. A drag on the economy. But they couldn't be more wrong.

[CUT: Quick montage of diverse people in challenging situations]

Empathy isn't just feeling sorry for someone. It's about truly seeing their humanity.

Remember the Good Samaritan? That story wasn't about being nice. It was about crossing every social boundary to help someone in need.

[DRAMATIC PAUSE]

Jesus wasn't just teaching a lesson. He was showing us what God looks like.

A God who doesn't just watch from a distance, but gets right into our mess. Who sees the person everyone else ignores.

[LEANING IN CLOSER TO CAMERA]

Empathy is revolutionary. It says: Your pain matters. Your story matters. YOU matter.

In a world that wants to divide us, empathy connects us.

[SOFTER TONE]
It's not weakness. 
It's our greatest strength.

[FINAL DIRECT ADDRESS]
Are you willing to see the human behind the label?
