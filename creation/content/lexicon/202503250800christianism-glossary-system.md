# Christianism Lexicon: System Design

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive glossary system for the MAGA Christianism project, designed to efficiently explain technical terminology while preserving word count for analysis in the main content.

## System Components

### 1. Standalone Glossary Page
- **Format**: Create a dedicated Substack page (not a regular post)
- **Navigation**: Pin to your Substack menu for constant accessibility
- **Organization**: Alphabetical with category tags for filtering
- **Updates**: Add new terms as they emerge in your analysis
- **SEO Value**: Serves as an evergreen resource for search traffic

### 2. Term-Specific Lexicon Posts
- **Format**: Compact definition posts (300-400 words)
- **Structure**:
  - Term & brief definition
  - Etymology & historical context
  - Current usage & significance
  - Related terms with links
- **Visual Identity**: Consistent header design signaling "reference content"
- **Publication Strategy**: Release 1-2 per month between analytical posts

### 3. Inline Reference System
- **Format**: First mention of a technical term gets subtle formatting
- **Implementation**: Italicize or highlight terms with link to glossary entry
- **Example**: "The rise of *Christianism* in contemporary politics..."
- **Consistency**: Apply the same treatment across all content types

### 4. Post-Content Footnotes
- **Format**: Brief definitions at the end of analytical posts
- **Implementation**: 1-2 line definitions with links to full entries
- **Example**: "† Christianism: The politicization of Christian identity into an ideological movement. [Full definition →]"
- **Benefit**: Provides immediate context without disrupting the reading experience

## Visual System

### Lexicon Entry Headers
- **Consistent Template**: Blue gradient background with scholarly reference aesthetic
- **Text Treatment**: "Christianism Lexicon: [Term]" in consistent font/placement
- **Sizing**: 1200x400px (optimal for Substack headers)
- **Visual Differentiation**:
  - Primary concepts: Deep blue gradient
  - Historical terms: Blue-purple gradient
  - Contemporary movements: Blue-teal gradient

### Main Text Formatting
- **Term as Heading**: Term appears as H1 at top of post
- **Definition**: First paragraph provides concise, authoritative definition
- **Section Headers**: Consistent H2 headings for Etymology, Usage, Significance
- **Related Terms**: Listed at bottom with hyperlinks to other entries

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Create master glossary page
- Develop 3-5 cornerstone lexicon entries for most essential terms
- Announce to readers as a dedicated resource

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 5-12)
- Add 1-2 new lexicon entries per month
- Implement inline linking system
- Begin using post-content footnotes

### Phase 3: Expansion (Ongoing)
- Develop additional entries based on reader questions
- Create category-specific collections
- Consider reader-suggested additions

## Key Terms for Initial Development

### Primary Concepts
1. **Christianism**: The politicization of Christian identity into an ideological movement
2. **MAGA Christianism**: The specific fusion of Christian nationalist elements with Trumpian populism
3. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims of direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning

### Historical Context
1. **Christian Nationalism**: The fusion of Christian and American identities
2. **Dominionism**: The belief that Christians should seek to control secular institutions

### Contemporary Movements
1. **Identity Synthesis**: The fusion of religious, national, and partisan identities
2. **Post-Truth Politics**: Political discourse where objective facts are less influential than appeals to emotion

## Benefits
- Preserves word count for in-depth analysis
- Creates evergreen content that builds authority
- Provides clear navigation for new readers
- Establishes foundation for eventual book glossary
- Creates additional entry points for search traffic

This glossary system transforms technical terminology from a barrier into a strategic asset, helping both casual and committed readers engage more deeply with your analysis.
