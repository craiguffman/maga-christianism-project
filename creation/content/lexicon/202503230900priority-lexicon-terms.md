# Priority Lexicon Terms for Early Definition

This document identifies and prioritizes key terms for early definition in your Christianism Lexicon, organized by category and implementation phase. Each term includes a brief rationale explaining its importance to your overall project and analysis.

## Foundational Terms (First Two Months)

These terms establish the core analytical framework and should be defined first to provide essential scaffolding for readers:

### 1. Christianism
**Rationale**: Your central analytical category that distinguishes political ideology from religious faith. Defining this term early establishes your precise vocabulary and analytical approach, preventing readers from confusing your critique with a general criticism of Christianity.

### 2. MAGA Christianism
**Rationale**: The specific contemporary manifestation you're analyzing, requiring clear differentiation from broader Christian nationalism and other forms of Christianism. This definition creates a bounded focus for your analysis.

### 3. Primitive Biblicism
**Rationale**: The first theological mutation you identify in MAGA Christianism, requiring early explanation as it underpins many of the interpretive moves you'll analyze. This term helps readers understand how biblical interpretation becomes distorted in service of political ends.

### 4. Practical Atheism
**Rationale**: The second theological mutation, requiring definition to help readers understand how Christian language can be divorced from Christian practice. This concept illuminates the gap between professed beliefs and actual behaviors in MAGA Christianism.

### 5. Binary Apocalypticism
**Rationale**: The third theological mutation, requiring definition to explain how complex realities become reduced to absolute categories of good and evil. This concept helps readers understand the friend/enemy distinctions central to MAGA Christianism.

## Second-Tier Terms (Months 3-4)

These terms build upon the foundation and should be defined next:

### 6. Christian Nationalism
**Rationale**: The broader historical category within which MAGA Christianism operates, requiring definition to provide historical context. This term helps readers understand the longer trajectory of religious-nationalist fusion in American history.

### 7. Identity Synthesis
**Rationale**: A key sociological concept explaining how religious, national, and partisan identities fuse into a single consolidated identity. This term helps readers understand the psychological mechanisms that make Christianism resistant to critique.

### 8. Freedom as Non-Domination
**Rationale**: Your alternative theological understanding of freedom that contrasts with MAGA Christianism's conception. This term provides a constructive alternative rather than merely critique.

### 9. Ramist Realism
**Rationale**: The historical-philosophical root of primitive biblicism that helps explain its epistemological foundations. This term demonstrates the deep historical roots of contemporary phenomena.

### 10. Dominionism
**Rationale**: A specific theological-political movement that influences MAGA Christianism but remains distinct from it. This term helps readers understand the various streams that feed into contemporary religious nationalism.

## Third-Tier Terms (Months 5-6)

These terms add nuance to your analysis and should be defined after the foundational and second-tier terms:

### 11. Participatory Theology
**Rationale**: Your alternative to the contractual theology of MAGA Christianism, emphasizing relationship over transaction. This constructive term offers readers a theological alternative.

### 12. Post-Truth Politics
**Rationale**: The broader political context in which MAGA Christianism operates, helping explain its relationship to facts and evidence. This term connects your theological analysis to contemporary political discourse.

### 13. Biblical Literalism
**Rationale**: A specific interpretive approach often employed in MAGA Christianism that requires explanation for readers unfamiliar with hermeneutical discussions. This term helps readers understand specific interpretive moves.

### 14. White Christian Nationalism
**Rationale**: The specific racialized form that much of American Christian nationalism takes, requiring explicit definition. This term addresses the racial dynamics often implicit but unacknowledged in Christianist discourse.

### 15. Prophetic vs. Priestly Religion
**Rationale**: A distinction that helps explain different approaches to political engagement within religious traditions. This term provides historical context for alternative religious-political engagements.

## Fourth-Tier Terms (Months 7-8)

These more specialized terms should be defined after the broader conceptual framework is established:

### 16. Civil Religion
**Rationale**: The quasi-religious dimension of American political culture that intersects with but differs from explicitly religious movements. This term helps explain the specifically American context of Christianism.

### 17. Religious Economy
**Rationale**: The marketplace dynamics that shape religious movements in the American context. This term helps explain institutional and economic factors in religious-political movements.

### 18. Theological Anthropology
**Rationale**: Underlying assumptions about human nature that shape political and theological positions. This term helps readers understand deeper philosophical foundations.

### 19. Eschatological Politics
**Rationale**: How end-times beliefs shape contemporary political engagement. This term connects apocalyptic theology to specific political behaviors.

### 20. Moral Formation
**Rationale**: How character and virtue develop through practices rather than mere principles. This term helps explain the ethical dimensions of your critique.

## Specialized Terms (Months 9-12)

These more technical terms can be defined later in your lexicon development:

### 21. Epistemological Tribalism
**Rationale**: How group identity shapes what information is considered credible. This term helps explain information dynamics in Christianist communities.

### 22. Hermeneutical Injustice
**Rationale**: When interpretive resources are dominated by particular groups. This term addresses power dynamics in biblical interpretation.

### 23. Sacramental Imagination
**Rationale**: An alternative way of understanding the world as infused with divine presence. This term offers a constructive theological alternative.

### 24. Theological Method
**Rationale**: How theological claims are derived and justified. This term helps readers understand methodological differences in theological approaches.

### 25. Christology
**Rationale**: Understanding of Christ's nature and significance. This term addresses how Jesus functions differently in different theological systems.

## Implementation Strategy

### Definition Order
1. Start with the five foundational terms
2. Alternate between critique terms and constructive alternatives
3. Introduce historical terms to provide context
4. Add specialized terms as your analysis deepens

### Cross-Referencing
- Link "Primitive Biblicism" to "Ramist Realism" when both are defined
- Connect "Binary Apocalypticism" to "Eschatological Politics"
- Link "Practical Atheism" to "Moral Formation"
- Connect "MAGA Christianism" to "White Christian Nationalism"
- Link "Freedom as Non-Domination" to "Participatory Theology"

### Reader-Responsive Additions
Be prepared to add terms based on:
- Reader questions in comments
- Contemporary events that require new analytical categories
- Connections to specific content in your other series

This prioritized approach ensures your lexicon develops systematically while remaining responsive to reader needs and the evolving conversation around your analysis.
