## Definition
MAGA Christianism represents a specific variant of Christianism that fuses traditional Christian nationalist elements with Trumpian populism, creating a religio-political worldview where partisan loyalty becomes inseparable from religious identity.

## Etymology
The term combines "MAGA" (Make America Great Again), Donald Trump's campaign slogan first used in 2016, with "Christianism." While the fusion of Christianity with American exceptionalism has deeper historical roots, MAGA Christianism specifically emerged during the Trump era as evangelical leaders increasingly portrayed Trump as divinely appointed despite his personal divergence from traditional Christian values.

## Contemporary Usage
In current discourse, MAGA Christianism describes the phenomenon where Christian religious expression becomes intertwined with MAGA political identity. The term appears in political analysis, religious studies, and media commentary to distinguish this movement from both traditional evangelicalism and broader Christian nationalism.

## Significance
MAGA Christianism represents a watershed development in American religious politics where political allegiance becomes a test of religious authenticity. Understanding this concept helps explain how religious language gets repurposed to sanctify political figures and positions that might otherwise conflict with traditional Christian ethics.

## Theological Mutations
MAGA Christianism is characterized by three primary theological mutations:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning that bypasses interpretive traditions
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar and replaces him with pragmatic politics disconnected from Christ's example
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Divides the world into good and evil, friends and enemies, saved and damned

These mutations represent significant departures from orthodox Christian theology across denominational lines.
