## Definition
Christianism refers to the politicization of Christian identity into an ideological movement that systematically deploys religious symbols, language, and identity markers to advance specific political agendas and power structures.

## Etymology
The term "Christianism" has deeper historical roots than commonly recognized, appearing in 19th century religious texts during the same period when scholars like Adolf von Harnack and Ernst Troeltsch pioneered the "history of religions" approach. Its modern usage follows linguistic patterns similar to "Islamism," signifying the transformation of religious identity into political ideology. Andrew Sullivan helped popularize the term in his 2006 Time magazine article "My Problem with Christianism," while academic Rogers Brubaker later integrated it into comparative frameworks of religious nationalism.

## Contemporary Usage
In contemporary discourse, "Christianism" distinguishes politically-motivated religious identity from Christianity as a faith tradition. The term has gained traction in academic circles studying religious nationalism and in political commentary analyzing the religious right. Unlike terms such as "Christian nationalism," "Christianism" specifically highlights the ideological transformation of religious identity rather than merely describing political goals.

## Significance
Understanding Christianism is essential for analyzing how religious identity functions within power structures beyond matters of personal faith. The concept helps illuminate how theological language and Christian symbolism can be repurposed to serve political objectives while maintaining the appearance of religious authenticity. By distinguishing Christianism from Christianity, we can better recognize when religious rhetoric masks political ambitions.
