## New Methodological Framework: Theological Critique of MAGA Christianism

### Foundational Theological Mutations

The project identifies three core theological mutations that co-articulate to produce MAGA Christianism:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: 
   - Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
   - Bypasses interpretive traditions
   - Weaponizes scripture as a tool of political control
   - Reduces complex theological understanding to simplistic proof-texting

2. **Practical Atheism**:
   - Removes Jesus as supreme exemplar
   - Replaces Christian practices with political pragmatism
   - Subordinates Christian identity to nationalist ideology
   - Prioritizes political power over Christian witness

3. **Binary Apocalypticism**:
   - Divides the world into absolute categories of good and evil
   - Eliminates nuance and possibility of reconciliation
   - Creates friend/enemy distinctions that contradict Christian neighbor-love
   - Uses eschatological language to justify political exclusion

### Theological Counternarratives

#### Trinitarian Foundation
- Emphasizes God's self-giving love without domination
- Rejects power-oriented theological constructions
- Centers relational understanding over hierarchical control
- Understands Christian identity as participation in divine life

#### Epistemological Approach
- Knowledge as relational encounter
- Rejection of foundationalist certainty
- Emphasis on interpretive communities
- Attention to particular historical and cultural contexts

### Hermeneutical Principles

1. **Special Equity** (Following Richard Hooker):
   - Contextual application of general principles
   - Rejection of abstract universalism
   - Attentiveness to particular circumstances

2. **Mimetic Formation**:
   - Virtue learned through imitation and practice
   - Character shaped by communal practices
   - Rejection of principle-based ethics

3. **Relational Receptivity**:
   - Theological understanding emerges through encounter
   - Openness to difference
   - Hospitality as theological practice
