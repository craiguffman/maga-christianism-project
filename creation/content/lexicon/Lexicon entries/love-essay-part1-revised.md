# Love (Part 1): The Theological Foundations of Love

The Easter after my father died, I found myself alone in St. Thomas' Church after the Easter Vigil. The last of my parishioners had filed out of the sanctuary, but I remained, still feeling the joy of Easter even as I grieved my father's death. In that sacred emptiness, I experienced a moment of profound clarity about the nature of love. Not the sentimental affection we often call "love," but the ferocious, creative force that the Christian tradition identifies as God's very essence.

In that moment, I understood something I'd known intellectually but never fully grasped: that love isn't primarily a feeling but a mode of participation in divine reality. This insight has profound implications not just for personal relationships but for theological and political discourse—particularly as we confront distortions of love in movements like MAGA Christianism.

## Trinitarian Love: God's Self-Giving Without Domination

Christian theology has long understood God's essence as love, but not just any love. The Trinity reveals divine love as self-giving communion without domination—the Father, Son, and Spirit eternally giving themselves to one another without coercion or diminishment.

This trinitarian love forms the foundation for all genuine love. It reveals love not as absorption of the other into oneself (which eliminates difference) nor as distant tolerance (which maintains isolation) but as participation in the other's life while preserving distinct identity. The persons of the Trinity remain distinctly themselves while fully participating in one another's life.

The implications are profound. If God's very being is love-as-participation, then authentic human love must likewise be participatory. We love not by eliminating differences but by participating in one another's lives across differences. We love not by dominating others nor by abandoning boundaries, but by entering into relationships of mutual recognition without domination.

This trinitarian understanding stands in stark contrast to MAGA Christianism's frequent reduction of love to either sentimental feeling or tribal loyalty. The movement displays genuine affection for in-group members while often failing to extend loving recognition across difference. This isn't trinitarian love but its distortion—love reduced to sameness rather than communion-in-difference.

## Love's Manifestation in Christ: Being With Rather Than Doing For

The incarnation reveals how divine love manifests in human experience. As Samuel Wells has powerfully argued, God's solution to human suffering wasn't merely to fix things for us (which maintains distance) or to us (which violates agency), but to be with us in our suffering.

This "being with" represents the heart of genuine love. It doesn't minimize suffering or rush to solutions but maintains presence, honors agency, and affirms the beloved's dignity even in their pain. It recognizes that the fundamental human need isn't just for problems to be solved but for our existence to be validated through relationships of recognition.

Christ's incarnation exemplifies this love-as-presence. God doesn't remain distant from human suffering, offering solutions from above, but enters fully into human experience, including its pain and limitation. This divine "being with" culminates at the cross, where God in Christ experiences the depths of human suffering and alienation without abandoning us to face it alone.

MAGA Christianism often displays what we've identified as the second theological mutation: practical atheism, where Jesus as exemplar is removed and replaced with pragmatic politics disconnected from his example. This mutation transforms love from Christ-like "being with" into either sentimental feeling or pragmatic action. Both miss the essentially relational character of genuine love.

When Christ's example of "being with" is replaced by political pragmatism, love becomes instrumentalized—valuable not in itself but only for what it achieves. This distortion manifests in political discourse that values effectiveness over faithfulness, results over relationship, winning over witness.

## Love as Participation in Divine Reality

Love in Christian theology isn't merely an emotion or ethical principle but a mode of participation in divine reality. As Augustine and later theologians recognized, to love is to participate in God's own life, since God is love. This participation doesn't eliminate our distinct identity but fulfills it, just as the persons of the Trinity find their fulfillment in mutual indwelling.

This participatory understanding transforms how we approach both personal relationships and political engagement. If love means participation in divine reality, then authentic love can never be merely private emotion or abstract principle. It must manifest in concrete relationships of mutual recognition across difference.

The participatory nature of love provides a powerful corrective to MAGA Christianism's frequent privatization of love. When the movement confines love to private feeling while pursuing power-oriented politics, it fragments what should be integrated. Genuine love, rooted in trinitarian participation, cannot be separated from how we organize our common life.

## Love Without Sentimentality

Our culture often reduces love to sentiment—warm feelings divorced from moral demand. This sentimentalization corrupts love's transformative power by separating feeling from action, emotion from obligation. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer recognized, such "cheap love" costs us nothing and changes nothing.

Trinitarian love demands more. It requires not just feeling for others but recognizing their rightful participation in our common life. It moves beyond empathy (feeling what others feel) to justice (recognizing others' legitimate place in community regardless of whether we emotionally resonate with their experience).

This distinction between sentimental and trinitarian love helps explain MAGA Christianism's inconsistent application of love across different domains. The movement often displays genuine emotional warmth toward in-group members while maintaining policies that prevent full participation of those beyond its boundaries. This isn't the integration of love and justice that trinitarian theology demands but their separation.

The antidote to sentimentalized love isn't emotional coldness but love grounded in trinitarian participation. Such love doesn't eliminate emotion—indeed, it may involve profound feeling—but it cannot be reduced to emotion. It manifests in concrete relationships of recognition across difference, in systems that enable participation without domination, in communities where distinct identities flourish through mutual recognition.

## Freedom as Capacity to Love

This trinitarian understanding of love directly shapes how we understand freedom. If love means participation without domination, then authentic freedom must be the capacity for such participation—not abstract autonomy but the ability to enter into relationships of mutual recognition across difference.

This understanding stands in contrast to both libertarian conceptions of freedom (freedom from interference) and authoritarian conceptions (freedom through submission). Trinitarian freedom emerges not from absence of relationship nor from domination within relationship, but from participation in relationships without domination.

For Christians, this freedom manifests most fully through participation in Christ. As Paul recognized, the essence of Christian freedom isn't autonomy from obligation but incorporation into Christ's own life. We become most fully ourselves not by escaping relationship but by participating in the divine relationship that fulfills rather than diminishes our unique identity.

MAGA Christianism's approach to freedom often misses this participatory dimension. The movement frequently oscillates between libertarian rhetoric (freedom as non-interference in certain domains) and authoritarian practice (freedom as submission to certain leaders). Both miss the essentially relational character of genuine freedom as capacity for love without domination.

## Toward a Politics of Love

These theological reflections have profound implications for political discourse. If love means participation without domination, then a genuinely loving politics must create conditions where all can participate in common life without being subject to arbitrary power.

This understanding transcends conventional political categories. It critiques both progressive sentimentality (which separates loving feeling from just structures) and conservative individualism (which separates personal virtue from systemic justice). It calls for integration rather than fragmentation—for politics that enables full participation of all in our common life.

MAGA Christianism's political theology often fragments what should be integrated, privatizing love while pursuing power-oriented politics. This fragmentation reflects its practical atheism—its disconnection from Christ's example of love as "being with" those who suffer.

The alternative isn't withdrawal from politics but transformation of political engagement through trinitarian love. This doesn't mean imposing religious doctrine through political power—itself a form of domination. It means working for political arrangements that enable participation without domination, that recognize each person's rightful place in our common life regardless of whether their experiences resonate with our own.

Such politics may not always align neatly with existing partisan divisions. At times it will challenge progressive presumptions; at others, conservative assumptions. Its primary loyalty isn't to political tribe but to trinitarian love that enables participation without domination.

In a second essay, I'll explore how this theological understanding of love manifests in concrete practices of community formation. For now, I invite reflection on how trinitarian love might transform our approach to both personal relationships and political engagement, moving us beyond sentimentality toward genuine participation in divine reality.
