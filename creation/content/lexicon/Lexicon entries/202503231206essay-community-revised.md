# Community: Resilient Connections Against Isolation

The practice of [LEXICON: Biblical Lament] we explored previously isn't meant to be solitary. In fact, it's through shared grief that we discover the healing power of authentic community—a power increasingly rare in our fragmented society.

I recently attended two gatherings in the same week. The first was a political rally, where thousands chanted identical slogans in response to a charismatic leader who promised belonging through the identification of common enemies. The second was a parish potluck, where Episcopalians of vastly different political persuasions broke bread together, their connections forged not by agreement but by practice—the regular sharing of communion that preceded their sharing of casseroles.

The contrast haunts me as I consider our national fracturing. The hunger for belonging that drives many toward [LEXICON: MAGA Christianism] isn't itself wrong; it reflects a fundamentally human need. The question is what kind of communities we will build to satisfy this hunger—and what theological vision will shape them.

## The Fracturing of American Community

We've witnessed the steady erosion of American community over decades. Technological isolation keeps us connected to screens but separated from neighbors. Economic insecurity forces frequent relocations and longer working hours. Geographic sorting has turned neighborhoods and churches into ideological echo chambers.

Into this void step political actors eager to exploit loneliness. The extremes of our political spectrum offer the same basic promise: join us, and you'll never be alone again. Identify the correct enemies, use the right language, signal the proper allegiances, and you'll find the belonging you crave.

This appeal is powerful precisely because the need is real. Yet the communities formed through such means inevitably disappoint. Identity forged primarily through opposition cannot sustain genuine connection. The spiritual consequences of pursuing community this way are devastating, leaving us more isolated even as we perform belonging.

## A Sacramental Vision of Community

Christianity offers a fundamentally different vision of community—one centered not on agreement or shared enemies but on practices that form us over time. At the heart of this vision stands the Eucharist, where ordinary elements become extraordinary through regular, shared engagement.

Richard Hooker described the church as "the mystical, visible body of Christ"—a community that becomes something it wasn't before through sacramental practice. When we break bread together in recognition and praise of the Sustainer, the Spirit intercedes to build what we could never construct through mere human effort.

This is no abstract theological claim but a practical reality I've witnessed in parish life. People who would never choose each other as friends find themselves bound together through the regular practice of kneeling side by side at the communion rail. The shared posture of humility creates possibilities that political posturing never could.

In our current moment, where division is weaponized and belonging is commodified, there's something radically countercultural about communities formed through what the Book of Common Prayer calls "our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving." We become a koinonia of sufferings and joys, not because we've erased our differences but because we've learned to hold them differently.

## Symphony, Not Uniformity

The current anti-DEI frenzy sweeping through certain quarters of American Christianity reflects a profound theological misunderstanding. The goal of authentic Christian community has never been uniformity but harmony—the ability to maintain distinction while creating beauty together.

John Milbank, drawing on Augustine's De Música, suggests that Christian community should resemble a complex musical composition rather than a monotone. Hans Urs von Balthasar extends this metaphor, envisioning humanity as a symphony with God as Conductor, each person playing their unique part in the cosmic performance.

This vision stands in stark contrast to both secular individualism and religious conformity. We are not isolated actors pursuing private fulfillment, nor are we identical notes in a dreary repetition. Rather, we are freed to be fully human—which is to be freed to be the unique images of God we were created to be. When we embrace this vision, we become creators of the very diversity through which God sustains us.

## False Communities vs. True Communities

How can we distinguish authentic community from its counterfeits? False communities demand uniformity, establish rigid boundaries, and constantly test loyalty. They thrive on enemy-making and maintain cohesion through fear of exclusion.

True communities, by contrast, practice truth-telling, extend welcome to the stranger, and establish mutual accountability. They understand that genuine connection requires not the absence of conflict but its transformation. They recognize difference as gift rather than threat.

[LEXICON: MAGA Christianism] offers a particularly dangerous counterfeit of community. By positioning itself as the defender of "real America" against various enemies (immigrants, progressives, religious minorities), it provides the emotional satisfaction of belonging without the spiritual transformation that authentic community requires. It offers the dopamine hit of righteous anger rather than the steady nourishment of humble service.

## Lessons from Military Community

Veterans understand something about true community that our broader culture has forgotten. Military units must forge bonds across profound differences because their survival depends on it. They cannot indulge the luxury of associating only with those who share their politics, background, or worldview.

I've heard countless veterans describe the bonds formed during service as the deepest they've ever known—not because the military erased difference, but because it created a framework within which difference could be received as strength rather than weakness. The unit became a kind of sacramental community, where ordinary people became extraordinary through shared practice and common purpose.

As veterans reenter civilian life, many experience profound isolation. The absence of the practices and purposes that formed their military community leaves a void that [LEXICON: Disordered Nationalism] often tries to fill. Yet veterans also bring invaluable wisdom about what genuine connection across difference requires: shared sacrifice, mutual accountability, and commitment to something greater than individual preference.

## Practices That Build Community

How do we cultivate communities resilient enough to withstand our current polarization? We begin with practices that create spaces of encounter across difference: shared meals, common work projects, regular rituals that remind us of our interdependence. We establish rhythms of gathering that don't depend on momentary emotion but persist through disagreement and difficulty.

The discipline of remaining in relationship through conflict proves especially crucial. When disagreement becomes grounds for division, we short-circuit the very processes that could lead to deeper understanding. Local organizing around concrete shared interests—better schools, safer neighborhoods, cleaner environments—often creates surprising alliances that transcend ideological sorting.

For Christians, reclaiming sacramental practices offers a particularly powerful antidote to division. The regular discipline of confessing that we "have not loved our neighbors as ourselves" creates a posture fundamentally at odds with self-righteousness. The practice of passing peace to those with whom we disagree reminds us that reconciliation is not optional but essential to our identity. The shared meal of communion establishes a table fellowship that challenges every other basis for inclusion and exclusion.

## Technology and Authentic Connection

Can digital spaces foster genuine community? The evidence suggests serious limitations. Online interaction often amplifies division, rewards outrage, and lacks the embodied vulnerability that deep connection requires. Yet dismissing digital community entirely would ignore the real connections that form through these means, especially for those whose access to physical community is limited by geography, disability, or circumstance.

Those of us attempting to create public theology through platforms like Substack and Facebook face particular challenges. How do we move beyond broadcasting opinions to fostering genuine conversation? How do we resist the commodification of community that treats followers as consumers rather than participants?

These questions have no easy answers, but they must be engaged if we're to build alternatives to the pseudo-communities currently dominating our national life. Perhaps we begin by approaching digital space itself as a kind of liturgical environment—one whose practices form us in particular ways, for better or worse, depending on how intentionally we structure them.

## An Alternative Vision

As MAGA Christianism continues to offer belonging through division, those of us formed by different theological traditions must provide an alternative vision—one where community emerges not through identifying enemies but through practicing presence; not through enforcing uniformity but through receiving difference as gift.

This vision offers both resistance to authoritarianism and seeds of renewal. When we become, through shared practice, what we weren't before—a community capable of maintaining connection across difference—we demonstrate that the dominant paradigm of division is neither inevitable nor fulfilling.

The sacramental community stands as living testimony that another way is possible. In a world increasingly structured around the amplification of difference for political advantage, there's something profoundly subversive about coming together across those very differences to break bread, speak truth, and glimpse, however imperfectly, the kingdom where unity and diversity perfectly coexist.

## From Community to Hope

The communities we build—whether parish potlucks or military units—create the foundation for something our political moment desperately needs: genuine [LEXICON: Hope as Virtue] that transcends both cynicism and false optimism. Without the sustenance of community, hope withers into either naive optimism or bitter resignation. With community, hope becomes not just possible but sustainable even in the most challenging circumstances.
