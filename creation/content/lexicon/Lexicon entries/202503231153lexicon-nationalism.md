## Definition
**Nationalism** refers to the political principle or movement based on an identification with one's nation and support for its interests. When rightly ordered, nationalism functions as a gift that binds diverse peoples together through shared civic commitment. When disordered, it becomes an idolatrous system that absolutizes national identity above all other commitments and excludes those deemed insufficiently "authentic."

## Distinctions

### Rightly Ordered Nationalism
Rightly ordered nationalism serves as a unifying force that:
- Creates mutual obligation across differences of race, religion, and ideology
- Fosters patriotic commitment while remaining open to critical engagement
- Balances particular attachment to one's nation with universal moral principles
- Acknowledges both national achievements and failures honestly
- Defines national belonging through civic commitment rather than ethnic or religious identity
- Remains subordinate to higher commitments (for people of faith, to God)

### Disordered Nationalism
Disordered nationalism transforms into an exclusive and often idolatrous system that:
- Elevates national identity above all other commitments, including religious ones
- Defines authentic national belonging through ethnic, religious, or ideological purity
- Rejects critical engagement with national history and failings
- Creates sharp divisions between "real" citizens and others
- Sacrifices universal moral principles for perceived national advantage
- Often merges with religious identity to create a sacralizing effect

## Theological Perspective
From a theological perspective, rightly ordered nationalism reflects the balance Scripture presents between particular attachment and universal concern. God works through particular peoples (Israel in the Hebrew Scriptures) while ultimately extending concern to all nations. The prophets model how to maintain deep love for one's nation while offering fierce critique when it strays from justice.

Christian theology recognizes that all human institutions, including nations, serve limited goods that must remain subordinate to God's ultimate claims. When national identity displaces God as the object of ultimate concern, it becomes a form of idolatry. At the same time, Christians are called to "seek the welfare of the city" (Jeremiah 29:7) where they live, suggesting that particular attachment to one's nation is appropriate when properly ordered.

## Contemporary Relevance
The distinction between rightly ordered and disordered nationalism has become increasingly crucial in our current political climate. Movements claiming the mantle of "nationalism" often exhibit the disordered characteristics described above‚Äîmerging religious and national identity, excluding those deemed insufficiently authentic, and rejecting critical engagement with history.

The alternative is not rejection of national identity altogether, but rather a nationalism rightly ordered‚Äîone that binds diverse peoples together through shared civic commitment while remaining open to critique and subordinate to higher moral principles.
