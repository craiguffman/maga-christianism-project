# Hope: Vision Beyond Resistance

The authentic communities we've described provide the necessary soil for cultivating what might be the most endangered [LEXICON: Theological Virtues] of our time: hope. Without the sustenance of community, hope withers into either naive optimism or bitter resignation.

Last Sunday, in a small parish church surrounded by MAGA flags and "Trump 2024" signs, I watched as an elderly Black woman and a young white man with a prominent MAGA hat shared the peace of Christ with each other. Neither changed their political convictions in that moment, but something more profound occurred—a glimpse of possibility beyond our divisions, a moment where a different reality broke through.

This is the territory of [LEXICON: Hope as Virtue], properly understood—not naive optimism based on favorable evidence, but a commitment to act as if reconciliation were possible even when all evidence suggests otherwise. As we navigate a political landscape increasingly dominated by cynicism, despair, and false hope, we need to recover hope as a theological virtue with revolutionary implications.

## The Crisis of Hope

Hope is the most endangered theological virtue in our time. We face multiple temptations that pull us away from authentic hope: cynicism that sees the worst in every situation; despair that abandons the possibility of meaningful change; and perhaps most dangerous, false hope that promises easy solutions to complex problems.

Political narratives across the spectrum participate in these distortions. [LEXICON: Disordered Nationalism] offers nostalgic hope—a return to an idealized past that never actually existed. The left sometimes succumbs to progressive inevitability—the assumption that the arc of history bends toward justice without human participation. Both represent misunderstandings of genuine hope.

## Hope as Theological Virtue

In my Duke essay examining Aquinas on hope, I explored how hope differs fundamentally from optimism. Optimism is a feeling grounded in favorable evidence. Hope is a virtue—a habit of character formed through practice—that persists regardless of evidence.

Aquinas understood hope as simultaneously gift and task. As gift, it flows from grace rather than human effort. As task, it requires our active participation and practice. Hope occupies the middle ground between presumption (assuming God's action requires nothing of us) and despair (believing God's promises cannot be fulfilled).

This balanced understanding provides a corrective to both the triumphalism of [LEXICON: MAGA Christianism] and the resignation sometimes found in progressive circles. Neither "God will restore American greatness regardless of our actions" nor "the forces arrayed against justice are too powerful to overcome" represents authentic theological hope.

Sam Wells' incarnational approach in "Godly Companions" further illuminates this understanding. Wells argues that hope is not escape from present difficulties but deeper engagement with them. He grounds hope in the practice of "being with"—standing alongside others in their struggle rather than attempting to solve problems from a distance.

This "being with" represents hope embodied, not merely proclaimed. When we remain present to suffering without rushing to fix it or flee from it, we enact the hope that difficulty is not the final word. The church at its best practices this incarnational hope by creating spaces where people can be fully seen in both their pain and their possibilities.

## False Hope vs. True Hope

Our current political moment offers numerous counterfeits of hope. Toxic positivity demands we ignore problems rather than address them. Triumphalism promises victory without vulnerability. Quick fixes offer easy answers to complex questions.

MAGA Christianism presents a particularly dangerous counterfeit through its apocalyptic vision. By framing political struggle as cosmic warfare between absolute good and evil, it offers the emotional satisfaction of clarity while undermining the spiritual discipline of complexity. Its promise that a strongman will restore order appeals precisely because it requires nothing of us except allegiance—the opposite of hope as virtue.

Aquinas helps us distinguish between authentic hope and its counterfeits. True hope, he argues, is always directed toward a "difficult good"—something valuable that cannot be easily attained. It requires patience, persistence, and partnership with both divine and human actors. It acknowledges hardship without being defined by it.

## Hope in Military Context

Veterans understand something about hope that our broader culture has forgotten: how to maintain possibility in desperate situations. Military service often places individuals in circumstances where optimism is impossible, yet hope remains essential for survival and mission accomplishment.

The military tradition distinguishes between false hope based on denial and genuine hope grounded in realistic assessment followed by committed action. When a unit faces overwhelming odds, effective leaders don't offer false reassurance or surrender to despair. Instead, they acknowledge difficulty while emphasizing capacity for action within constraints.

This balance mirrors theological hope. Like the soldier who continues the mission despite awareness of its costs, the person formed by Christian hope doesn't deny current reality but refuses to be limited by it. Veterans' experience of "hoping against hope" provides a model for civic engagement in our current moment—clear-eyed about challenges while committed to purpose beyond present circumstances.

## Practicing Hope as Virtue

If hope is virtue rather than mere feeling, how do we practice it? My Duke essay explores how hope, like other virtues, is formed through habitual action over time. We become hopeful by acting hopeful, even when we don't feel hopeful.

This understanding transforms small acts of beauty and justice from mere symbolic gestures into essential practices of virtue formation. When we build affordable housing in a community facing gentrification, we aren't simply addressing immediate needs; we're practicing the virtue of hope by acting as if a different future is possible. When we create art amid destruction, we aren't merely offering distraction; we're cultivating the habit of seeing possibility where others see only limitation.

Hope bears particular relationship to courage and perseverance. Courage allows us to act despite fear; perseverance enables us to continue despite difficulty. Together, these virtues create the conditions where hope can flourish—not as naive expectation that everything will work out, but as committed action toward what matters regardless of outcomes.

The discipline of celebrating partial victories proves especially important in sustaining hope. When we acknowledge steps toward justice, however incomplete, we practice seeing the world through hope's lens rather than cynicism's. When we mark moments of beauty amid brokenness, we train ourselves to perceive seeds of the future already sprouting in the present.

## Communal Practices of Hope

Wells emphasizes that hope cannot be sustained individually but requires community. Like all theological virtues, hope flourishes in context of shared practice and mutual encouragement. When my hope falters, I borrow yours; when yours diminishes, you draw from mine.

Worship itself functions as rehearsal of an alternative reality. When we gather to proclaim God's kingdom amid empirical evidence of its absence, we practice hope as commitment rather than conclusion. The liturgical imagination—acting as if God's promises were already fulfilled—trains us for civic imagination that works toward justice before its arrival.

Stories play crucial role in sustaining communal hope. When we tell narratives of transformation—both historic and contemporary—we expand our moral imagination beyond current limitations. The civil rights movement persisted because its leaders continually told stories of previous victories against impossible odds. Jewish Passover sustains hope through rehearsing liberation narratives generation after generation.

Intergenerational connections provide particular resources for hope. When elders share stories of surviving previous national crises, they provide context that challenges young people's tendency toward despair. When youth offer fresh vision unconstrained by adult resignation, they reinvigorate elders' capacity for imagination. Together, these perspectives create time horizons that extend beyond immediate political cycles.

## Hope as Political Commitment

Hope functions not merely as personal consolation but as political commitment. To hope is to reject both complacency with injustice and cynicism about change. It is to act "as if" reconciliation were possible while acknowledging the difficult path toward it.

Returning to Aquinas, hope directs us toward a "difficult good" that shapes character through its pursuit. The difficulty is not accidental but essential—it is precisely in reaching beyond what seems immediately possible that we become people capable of bringing new realities into being.

This understanding challenges both authoritarian certainty and progressive despair. Against those who promise easy restoration of greatness, it insists on the difficult work of wrestling with complexity. Against those who see only gathering darkness, it perceives light already breaking through.

As we stand at what feels like twilight for American democracy, theological hope offers neither false dawn nor surrender to night, but rather the commitment to kindle lamps that will illuminate our path regardless of how long darkness persists. It is not certainty that things will improve but conviction that lighting these lamps matters regardless of outcome.

## Toward Duty

Hope isn't merely a feeling but a commitment that calls us to action. This brings us to our next exploration: [LEXICON: Duty]—the covenant obligations that flow from theological hope and bind us to one another beyond mere self-interest. For hope without a sense of duty remains insubstantial; it is through fulfilling our obligations to truth and to each other that hope finds concrete expression in the world.
