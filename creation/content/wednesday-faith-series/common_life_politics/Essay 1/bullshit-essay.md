# Bullshit: Truth as Foundation Against Deception

![Hero image: A scale balancing truth and lies](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400)

In our fractured moment, where "alternative facts" compete with verifiable truth, I find myself returning to an unlikely theological resource: philosopher Harry Frankfurt's essay "On Bullshit." Frankfurt makes a crucial distinction between lying and bullshitting that illuminates our current crisis. The liar, he observes, still respects the truth enough to deliberately subvert it. The bullshitter, however, has a more dangerous relationship with truth—they simply don't care about it at all.

This indifference to truth represents a profound spiritual crisis. When <lexicon>truthfulness</lexicon> becomes optional—when we evaluate statements not by their accuracy but by their usefulness in advancing our tribal interests—we aren't merely making a political choice. We're making a theological one.

## Bullshit as Spiritual Crisis

The Christian tradition has always understood that our relationship to truth is inseparable from our relationship to God. John's Gospel introduces Jesus as the Logos—the Word or organizing principle of reality itself. When Jesus declares, "I am the way, the truth, and the life," he identifies himself with truth itself. To turn from truth is to turn from the divine.

This isn't abstract theology. It's practical spirituality. When we embrace bullshit—statements made with indifference to their truthfulness—we separate ourselves from reality as God has made it. We place our constructed narrative above the world God created.

At West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy, the honor code begins with "We do not lie, cheat, or steal." This isn't mere rule-following; it's recognition that <lexicon>integrity</lexicon> requires a fundamental commitment to truth. Without this foundation, neither military service nor Christian discipleship can function.

## Beyond Post-Truth Politics

Our current political climate often rewards what Stephen Colbert memorably called "truthiness"—feelings that seem true regardless of evidence. Both left and right can succumb to this temptation, though <lexicon>MAGA Christianism</lexicon> has elevated it to a defining characteristic.

When Christian leaders defend demonstrable falsehoods because they serve the "right side," they aren't engaging in political pragmatism—they're committing theological malpractice. They're teaching that tribal loyalty matters more than truthfulness, which means tribal identity matters more than God.

Jesus didn't say "your political agenda will set you free." He said "the truth will set you free" (John 8:32). This wasn't a suggestion; it was a description of spiritual reality. Freedom—genuine human flourishing—cannot exist when disconnected from truth.

## Truth-Telling as Spiritual Practice

How do we cultivate truthfulness in a post-truth age? The historic Christian practices offer guidance:

1. **Confession**: Regular acknowledgment of our own fallibility and tendency to self-deception.

2. **Testimony**: Speaking truth even when it's costly or inconvenient.

3. **Discernment in Community**: Testing our perceptions against the wisdom of diverse others, especially those with different perspectives.

4. **Humility**: Recognizing that our grasp of truth is always partial and requires constant revision.

These practices aren't just ethical guidelines; they're spiritual disciplines that form us into people capable of recognizing and rejecting bullshit—both others' and our own.

## A Different Path Forward

There is a different way than tribal truthiness. It begins with the recognition that truth isn't a possession to manipulate but a reality to which we submit. It continues with practices that form us into people who instinctively value accuracy over advantage, reality over rhetoric.

This path won't always be politically expedient. Truth-telling may sometimes disadvantage "our side." But it recognizes a deeper reality: there is ultimately only one side—God's side—and it is always the side of truth.

For those formed by Jesus Christ, truthfulness isn't optional. It's foundational to who we are called to be. In a world drowning in bullshit, this commitment to truth may be our most counter-cultural—and most necessary—witness.
