## The Hook

When Elon Musk declared "I am actually a socialist" while amassing a $200 billion fortune and fighting unionization efforts, he revealed more than just personal contradiction. He exposed a profound theological dimension to our economic moment â€“ one where freedom is invoked to justify domination, where populist language masks oligarchic power, and where salvation is promised through submission to market prophets.

## The Context

Since the 1970s, Western economies have undergone a profound transformation that philosophers call "neoliberalism" â€“ a project that promised freedom through markets while enabling new forms of domination. This economic transformation didn't just change our material conditions but reshaped our moral and theological imagination in ways that help explain the rise of MAGA Christianism.

Importantly, this economic shift converged with the white male reaction to the civil rights movement, women's liberation, and cultural changes of the 1960s. As racial hierarchies were challenged and gender roles questioned, many white men experienced a profound status anxiety that was intensified by economic dislocation. The development of theological innovations like biblical inerrancy in the 1970s parallels earlier theological technologies like Ramist realism â€“ both emerged as systems to reassert certainty and authority during periods of profound social upheaval.

As financialization detached economic activity from concrete communities, as job security gave way to precarity, and as public goods became private commodities, these combined forces created the perfect conditions for a religious-political movement that combines apocalyptic thinking, dominative power, and the promise of restoration.

## The Analysis

At the heart of our economic disorder lies a theological mistake about the nature of freedom. Neoliberalism embraces what philosopher Philip Pettit calls "freedom as non-interference" â€“ the idea that freedom merely means absence of constraint. This understanding sees relationships as potential intrusions on autonomy rather than as constitutive of personhood. It views borders primarily as protecting zones of individual choice rather than as enabling gift-exchange.

This conception of freedom stands in stark contrast to the Christian understanding of freedom as participation in God's life â€“ what theologian Luke Bretherton, drawing on republican political theory, calls "freedom as non-domination." In this vision, we are truly free not when we are autonomous but when we participate in relationships without domination.

The theological distortion runs deeper still. Our financialized economy operates through what Augustine called the "libido dominandi" â€“ the lust for domination. This dominative power operates by reducing persons to economic resources, communities to markets, and human flourishing to financial metrics.

Most perversely, this dominative economic system promises salvation through its very mechanisms of domination. As theologian Kathryn Tanner observes, finance-dominated capitalism functions as a theological system with its own soteriology â€“ promising delivery from precarity through submission to its disciplines. Work harder, be more entrepreneurial, embrace disruption â€“ and perhaps you'll be saved from economic disposability.

## The Evidence

This theological distortion manifests in our political economy in three crucial ways:

First, in the contradiction between populist rhetoric and oligarchic reality. When tech billionaires like Peter Thiel fund populist movements while building private islands and citizenship portfolios, we see not just hypocrisy but theological contradiction â€“ dominative power masquerading as liberation. This pattern has deep historical roots in American life, from the Barbadian planter class that established hierarchical plantation capitalism in early America through the King Cotton oligarchy that dominated the antebellum period to today's tech oligarchs.

Second, in what some call "crack-up capitalism" â€“ the emergence of competing oligarchic fiefdoms unconstrained by democratic accountability. When Musk purchases Twitter and single-handedly reshapes public discourse, when Jeff Bezos owns both essential commerce infrastructure and major media outlets, we witness the revival of plantation-like economic arrangements where unaccountable power centers serve private interests while claiming to serve the public good. Like plantation owners who justified their dominance through appeals to natural order and divine providence, today's tech oligarchs justify their power through quasi-theological narratives of "creative destruction," "disruption," and "inevitability."

Third, in the transformation of economic anxiety into apocalyptic politics. When economic precarity becomes unbearable, the theological imagination turns apocalyptic â€“ dividing the world into absolute good and evil, seeking savior figures who promise deliverance, embracing binary frameworks that leave no room for complexity. This apocalyptic imagination resonates with historical patterns where economic dislocation fuels religious-political movements promising restoration of "natural" hierarchies.

## The Implications

The theological dimensions of our economic disorder help explain MAGA Christianism's contradictions. It combines free-market rhetoric with protectionist policies, celebrates billionaires while claiming to champion ordinary Americans, and promises freedom while enabling domination â€“ all while using theological language to sanctify these contradictions.

More importantly, understanding this theological distortion points toward alternative possibilities. If our economic disorder stems from a theological mistake about freedom, power, and human flourishing, then genuine theological renewal might help imagine economic arrangements more conducive to human dignity.

## The Takeaway

What would a theological vision of economic life beyond domination look like? It would embrace what Bretherton calls "hallowing economic life" â€“ recognizing the irreducible worth of persons beyond their economic utility. It would create what Maritain called "complex space" â€“ institutional plurality that prevents both market and state domination. It would foster what Augustine called an "order of love" â€“ economic relationships ordered toward communion with God and neighbor.

This vision offers neither market absolutism nor state control, neither abstract globalism nor reactionary nationalism, but what Bretherton calls "Christian cosmopolitanism" â€“ economic arrangements that honor both particular identities and universal human dignity, creating spaces where different traditions can encounter each other without either homogenization or isolation.

The path beyond dominative economics begins not with policy prescriptions but with theological renewal â€“ recovering an understanding of freedom as participation, power as creative rather than dominative, and economic life as ordered toward communion rather than domination.
