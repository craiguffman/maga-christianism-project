# Substack Series Plan: Economic Theology Integration

## Overview
This plan outlines how to integrate the theological critique of contemporary capitalism into your existing Substack series plan, with a particular focus on connecting economic analysis to the theological mutations identified in MAGA Christianism.

## New Series: "Economic Idolatry"
A new series of 6-8 posts that explicitly examines the theological dimensions of contemporary capitalism, positioned as a complement to your existing content.

### Series Framing

The series explores the theological contradictions in both neoliberal capitalism and its populist reactions, offering a constructive vision of economic life oriented toward genuine communion.

3. Analyze contemporary oligarchic developments with Thiel, Musk, etc.
4. Research concrete examples of alternative economic arrangements

### Writing Approach
1. Begin each post with concrete example or story that illustrates economic-theological connection
2. Use biblical texts as framework for economic analysis
3. Connect abstract economic concepts to embodied experiences
4. Conclude with concrete examples of alternative possibilities

### Audience Considerations
1. Avoid technical economic jargon without explanation
2. Connect economic analysis to everyday experiences
3. Acknowledge economic concerns across political spectrum
4. Frame critique in theological rather than partisan terms

### Publication Timeline
Begin this series after establishing core foundations in existing content, perhaps starting around week 20 of your overall plan.
