# Freedom: The Capacity for Love Within Community

My workaholism reached its peak during my tenure as president of a high tech software company in Baton Rouge, Appro Systems, Inc. I treasured what I called my "freedom"—the ability to make decisions without interference, to shape my schedule according to my priorities, to build my life around my ambitions. This understanding of freedom as non-interference seemed self-evident. Who wouldn't want to eliminate constraints on their choices?

Yet despite this apparent "freedom," I found myself increasingly isolated, anxious, and spiritually depleted. The liberty I thought I was exercising was actually imprisoning me in patterns of behavior that undermined my relationships and eroded my sense of purpose. It wasn't until a profound spiritual awakening that I recognized the problem wasn't with the amount of freedom I had, but with my understanding of freedom itself.

This personal journey from misunderstanding to clarity about freedom parallels a broader theological confusion that manifests particularly clearly in MAGA Christianism's approach to liberty. The movement's rhetoric about freedom deserves careful theological examination, not merely political critique.

## Beyond Non-Interference

Contemporary American discourse typically understands freedom as non-interference—the absence of external constraints on individual choice. This conception appears in both progressive appeals to personal autonomy and conservative defenses of limited government. Despite their policy differences, both often share this fundamental assumption: freedom means being left alone to make your own choices.

Philip Pettit, in his influential work on republican political theory, offers a powerful alternative: freedom as non-domination. On this view, I am free not merely when others don't interfere with my choices, but when I'm not subject to arbitrary power—when no one has the capacity to interfere with my choices without regard for my interests.

This distinction helps explain why the enslaved person whose "kind" master rarely interferes still lacks freedom. The problem isn't the frequency of interference but the master's capacity to interfere arbitrarily. Freedom requires not just absence of interference but absence of the possibility of arbitrary interference.

This political conception resonates deeply with theological understandings of freedom. The Christian tradition has long recognized that genuine freedom isn't merely absence of constraint but presence of capacity—specifically, the capacity to love God and neighbor. As Augustine famously formulated it: "Love, and do what you will." True freedom isn't about eliminating obligations to others but about fulfilling our capacity for relationship.

MAGA Christianism frequently manifests what we've identified as "primitive biblicism"—claiming direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning while bypassing interpretive traditions. This hermeneutical approach allows selective readings of scripture that emphasize individualistic conceptions of freedom while minimizing communal dimensions. Passages about "freedom in Christ" are interpreted as liberation from obligation rather than capacity for love.

## Freedom Through Participation

Christian theology locates authentic freedom not in isolation but in participation—specifically, participation in God's trinitarian life. The Trinity reveals God as communion-in-difference, where distinct persons fully participate in one another's life without domination or diminishment. This divine reality becomes the pattern for human freedom.

We become most fully free not by escaping relationship but by participating in communities where we recognize one another without domination. Freedom emerges not from absence of obligation but from relationships characterized by mutual recognition rather than arbitrary power.

This participatory understanding transforms how we approach political questions. If freedom means capacity for participation without domination, then genuinely free societies require not just limits on government intervention but structures that prevent domination in all its forms—political, economic, social, and religious. They require not just formal rights but substantive conditions that enable all people to participate fully in common life.

MAGA Christianism often reduces freedom to absence of government interference in certain domains (particularly economic and religious) while overlooking or even supporting domination in others. This selective application reflects not coherent theology but political convenience—freedom invoked when it serves particular interests, ignored when it challenges them.

## The Fog on the Mountain

During a hike on Algonquin Peak, the second highest mountain in the Adirondack range, my wife Sajeena and I encountered a metaphor that helps illuminate the relationship between freedom and community. As we ascended near the summit, we found ourselves surrounded by dense fog that limited visibility to a few feet. Despite being completely "free" on that mountain—no fences, no guards, no restrictions—we found our practical freedom severely constrained by inability to see where we were going.

Only as the fog gradually lifted did we gain the freedom to navigate effectively, to choose our path with awareness of the landscape. Our formal freedom (absence of physical barriers) became actual freedom only when we could see the context in which we were acting.

This experience parallels how community functions in relation to freedom. Contrary to individualistic assumptions that community primarily constrains freedom, healthy communities actually enhance freedom by providing the context—the visibility—necessary for meaningful choice. They don't primarily limit our options but illuminate the landscape in which we're choosing.

MAGA Christianism often portrays community and individual freedom as inherently opposed—more community means less freedom, and vice versa. This zero-sum thinking reflects the movement's binary approach to complex realities. But genuine theological reflection reveals community and freedom as mutually reinforcing rather than opposed. We become most fully free through participation in communities characterized by mutual recognition rather than domination.

## Participatory Freedom in Christ

The New Testament consistently portrays Christian freedom not as escape from obligation but as incorporation into Christ's body. Paul's statement that "for freedom Christ has set us free" (Galatians 5:1) doesn't mean Christians should avoid commitment but that they should avoid returning to slavery—to patterns of domination that undermine mutual recognition.

This participatory understanding transforms how we read seemingly individualistic passages about Christian liberty. When Paul writes that "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom" (2 Corinthians 3:17), he's not advocating escape from communal obligation but transformation of community from domination to mutual recognition. The Spirit creates freedom precisely by incorporating us into Christ's body where we recognize one another without domination.

MAGA Christianism's selective biblical citation often emphasizes passages about freedom from law while minimizing those about freedom for love and service. This selective reading reflects not careful theological reflection but primitive biblicism that bypasses interpretive traditions that might challenge its individualistic assumptions.

## Protecting Freedom from Domination

If freedom means capacity for participation without domination, then genuinely free societies require institutions that prevent arbitrary power—that ensure no one can interfere with others' choices without regard for their interests. This understanding informed America's constitutional system with its checks and balances, separation of powers, and protection of basic rights.

MAGA Christianism often celebrates American freedom while undermining the very institutions designed to protect it from domination. The movement frequently supports concentrating power in particular leaders or groups while weakening constraints on that power. This approach reflects not coherent political philosophy but the binary thinking we've identified as characteristic of the movement—dividing the world into absolute good and evil, friends and enemies, with the "good" deserving unconstrained power over the "evil."

This binary thinking fundamentally misunderstands the nature of constitutional democracy, which assumes that power always requires constraint—not because all who hold power are evil, but because all are fallible. The constitutional system reflects not cynicism about human nature but realism about human limitation.

## The Freedom to Be With

Samuel Wells' incarnational emphasis on "being with" provides another theological lens for understanding freedom. Wells distinguishes "being with" from "working for" (which maintains distance), "working with" (which instrumentalizes relationship), and "being for" (which offers sympathy without presence). True freedom, on this view, is the capacity to be with others—to enter into authentic relationship characterized by presence rather than distance, mutuality rather than instrumentalization.

This understanding challenges both progressive and conservative distortions of freedom. It critiques progressive tendencies to reduce freedom to expressive individualism while ignoring relational obligations. It equally challenges conservative tendencies to celebrate formal freedom while overlooking substantive conditions necessary for participation without domination.

MAGA Christianism often displays what we've identified as practical atheism—removing Jesus as exemplar and replacing him with pragmatic politics. This theological distortion manifests in its approach to freedom, which emphasizes individual choice in ways disconnected from Christ's example of "being with" those who suffer.

## Toward Freedom as Capacity for Love

My journey from workaholism to genuine participation in community represents in microcosm the transformation needed in our theological and political discourse about freedom. We must move beyond understanding freedom merely as non-interference toward recognizing it as capacity for love within community—as participation without domination.

This understanding doesn't align neatly with existing political categories. At times it will challenge progressive assumptions; at others, conservative positions. Its primary concern isn't ideological consistency but theological faithfulness—recognizing freedom as God designed it, not as political convenience would have it.

For Christians concerned about MAGA Christianism's trajectory, this theological corrective offers a path forward. We need not choose between individualistic freedoms and communal obligations, between personal liberty and social responsibility. The Christian tradition offers a more integrated vision: freedom as capacity for love within community, as participation without domination.

This vision isn't utopian but practical. It's reflected in communities where people recognize one another across differences, where power is exercised for mutual flourishing rather than domination, where the fog lifts enough for each person to navigate their path with awareness of the landscape in which they're choosing. These communities offer a glimpse of the kingdom Jesus proclaimed—where true freedom emerges not from escape from obligation but from relationships of mutual recognition.
