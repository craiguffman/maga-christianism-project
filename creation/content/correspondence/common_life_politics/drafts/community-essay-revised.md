# Community: Building Resilient Connections Against Isolation

The atomization of American society has reached crisis levels. From declining civic participation to digital echo chambers, from suburban isolation to political tribalism, we face a profound disconnection from one another. This isolation creates fertile ground for the mutations of MAGA Christianism - primitive biblicism, practical atheism, and binary apocalypticism - which offer tribal belonging without the challenges of genuine community.

## The Mystical, Visible Body

The Anglican theologian Richard Hooker offers a profound alternative to both individualistic faith and partisan tribalism. He describes the church as "the mystical, visible body of Christ" - a community that transcends while honoring particularity, that embodies divine reality in concrete human relationships.

This vision stands in stark contrast to the ecclesiology implicit in MAGA Christianism, which often reduces the church to either a voluntary association of like-minded individuals or a cultural identity marker rather than a living organism formed by divine action. This represents what our syntopical analysis identifies as "ecclesial subordination" - subordinating church identity to national identity, undermining the church's capacity to function as alternative political community.

During my time at the Naval Academy, I experienced a parallel form of community - one that transcended individual preference while honoring personal dignity, that demanded sacrifice while providing profound belonging. Despite our differences, we were bound by shared commitment to something greater than ourselves. The church is called to an even deeper unity - not one based on human achievement or tribal similarity, but on participation in Christ's own life.

## Exceptional Confusion and Christian Community

This ecclesial subordination connects to another mutation we've identified: "exceptional confusion." When political leaders are granted near-messianic status, the church's unique role as Christ's body is diminished. True Christian community acknowledges that no political leader deserves the devotion properly given to Christ alone. The church's gathering should form us to recognize Christ's exceptional presence in the Eucharist, in Scripture, and in the marginalized - not in the exceptional status claimed by political figures.

This confusion manifests when Christian communities celebrate political leaders in ways that mimic worship - displaying their images alongside religious symbols, attributing providential significance to their rise to power, excusing behavior that would be condemned in others. Such exceptional treatment contradicts the leveling reality of Christian community where "there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28).

The early church maintained this distinction even under intense pressure. When Roman authorities demanded emperor worship, Christians refused to grant Caesar the exceptional status that belonged to Christ alone. This wasn't mere political resistance but theological clarity about where ultimate allegiance belonged. Today's church faces similar pressure to grant exceptional status to political figures who promise protection or restoration, a temptation that undermines our fundamental identity as Christ's body.

## The Eucharist as Community Formation

The centerpiece of Christian community is not shared political views, cultural preferences, or even doctrinal agreement, but participation in the Eucharist. This sacramental practice forms what the New Testament calls koinonia - communion that crosses boundaries of race, class, and ideology.

At the Eucharistic table, we don't choose our companions. We receive them as Christ receives us - not because of worthiness but because of grace. This practice directly confronts the third mutation of MAGA Christianism - binary apocalypticism - which divides the world into worthy insiders and unworthy outsiders.

In my parish ministry, I've witnessed the transformative power of sharing communion with those across deep political divides. The veteran who served in Vietnam breaking bread with the conscientious objector. The Trump supporter receiving the cup from the progressive activist. These encounters don't erase differences, but they place them within the larger context of shared participation in Christ's body.

## From False to True Sacrifice

MAGA Christianism often exhibits what our analysis identifies as "sacrificial inversion" - transferring sacrificial devotion from Christ's self-giving for the marginalized to nationalist sacrifice that reinforces existing power structures. This inversion creates communities defined by who they exclude rather than by Christ's radical inclusion.

True Christian community inverts this inversion. It understands sacrifice not as maintaining boundaries against threatening others but as Christ-like vulnerability that creates space for genuine encounter. The early church's radical economic sharing, hospitality to strangers, and transcendence of social divisions all manifested this authentic sacrificial community.

In my parish's refugee resettlement ministry, I've witnessed how sacrificial welcome transforms both hosts and newcomers. When established members give up comfort, convenience, and sometimes resources to create space for refugees, they discover not diminishment but enrichment through relationship with those who were previously strangers. This pattern of self-giving for the sake of the marginalized directly challenges the nationalist sacrifice that maintains boundaries against threatening others.

## The Symphony of Difference

Theologians John Milbank and Hans Urs von Balthasar offer the metaphor of symphony to understand Christian community. Unlike unison, which demands sameness, symphony requires difference - different instruments, different parts, different timbres - all contributing to a harmonious whole.

This musical metaphor challenges both the forced uniformity of authoritarian systems and the chaotic individualism of consumer capitalism. Symphony requires both individuality and coordination, both particularity and harmony. It offers an alternative to the binary thinking that divides the world into absolute categories, recognizing instead how differences can participate in mutual recognition.

During my Louisiana childhood, I experienced both the beauty of community and its shadow side. The close-knit neighborhood that supported my family through crisis was the same community that enforced racial segregation through both legal structures and social pressure. True Christian community must embrace the warmth of belonging while rejecting the exclusion of others.

## Digital Connection vs. Incarnational Community

The digital age offers unprecedented connectivity while often undermining genuine community. Social media platforms promise connection but deliver comparison, commodification, and conflict. Christian community offers an alternative - incarnational presence that embraces the limitations and gifts of embodied life.

This incarnational emphasis challenges the first mutation of MAGA Christianism - primitive biblicism - which often reduces faith to disembodied information rather than embodied formation. Christian community isn't primarily about sharing correct ideas but about practicing a way of life together.

In my own journey from digital connection to genuine community, I've discovered the irreplaceable value of shared meals, face-to-face conversation, and physical presence during crisis. When Claudia faced cancer, our healing came not through inspirational social media posts but through neighbors who mowed our lawn, church members who organized meal deliveries, and friends who sat with us in hospital waiting rooms. These incarnate practices of "being with" cannot be digitized without fundamental loss.

## Military Models of Community

My naval service exposed me to intensive community formation practices that the church would do well to study. The military understands that genuine community requires:

- **Shared narrative** - A compelling story that gives meaning to hardship
- **Common practices** - Regular rituals that form shared identity
- **Clear boundaries** - Understanding who we are and aren't
- **Mutual accountability** - Systems of responsibility and support
- **Transcendent purpose** - Mission that extends beyond individual benefit

What specifically distinguishes healthy military community is its recognition that unity emerges through shared challenge rather than shared comfort. In Basic Training and Officer Candidate School, bonds form through collective difficultyâ€”shared suffering that transcends individual differences. These experiences teach that authentic community isn't built through consumer preference but through committed presence even when it's costly.

While military communities can become excessively conformist, they offer a powerful alternative to the consumer model that has infiltrated many churches. Christian community isn't something we shop for based on preference; it's a covenant relationship that forms us through both comfort and challenge.

## Practices for Building Resilient Connections

Christian community doesn't happen accidentally; it requires intentional practices that form us for genuine connection:

- **Share regular meals** beyond mere hospitality events - create tables where genuine conversation can happen across differences
- **Establish mutual aid networks** that acknowledge interdependence through skill exchanges, emergency funds, and resource sharing
- **Create intergenerational formation** opportunities through mentoring relationships, multi-age learning environments, and shared projects
- **Gather for common prayer** that forms shared identity through liturgical practices that transcend political differences
- **Develop conflict transformation protocols** drawing on Matthew 18 and restorative justice principles
- **Practice boundary-crossing hospitality** that welcomes those who might otherwise remain strangers
- **Cultivate shared memory** through rituals that honor both achievements and failures in community history

These practices create communities capable of withstanding the pressures of polarization by forming members in habits of belonging that transcend political identity.

## Community as Resistance

In an age of division, genuine community becomes a form of resistance against the forces that would separate us. It challenges both the tribal identity politics of the right and the atomized individualism of consumer capitalism.

This resistance isn't primarily political but ontological - asserting through lived practice that we are, in fact, members of one another despite our differences. As theologian Willie James Jennings argues, "The most radical thing the church can do in our time is to actually be the church" - a community where genuine difference exists within genuine communion.

During times of national crisis, from 9/11 to the COVID pandemic, I've witnessed how congregations that had built strong relational foundations before the crisis demonstrated remarkable resilience during it. They had practices, relationships, and theological resources to weather the storm together rather than fragmenting under pressure.

## From Tribal Identity to Beloved Community

Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of the "Beloved Community" offers an alternative to both forced uniformity and fragmented individualism. This community embraces genuine difference while seeking the common good, acknowledges real conflicts while refusing permanent enmity, and grounds human connection in divine love rather than tribal similarity.

This vision directly challenges the second mutation of MAGA Christianism - practical atheism - which substitutes tribal belonging for Christ-centered community. The Beloved Community isn't based on shared politics, ethnicity, or culture, but on recognition of our common humanity and divine image.

Building such community requires both grace and truth - the grace to acknowledge our own limitations and the truth to confront systems of exclusion. It demands both patience for the long work of relationship-building and urgency in addressing barriers to full participation.

As we face a future of increasing polarization, economic uncertainty, and environmental challenge, resilient communities will become not just spiritually but practically essential. The connections we build today - across differences of politics, race, class, and generation - may determine not just the health of the church but the possibility of democratic flourishing.

May we be builders of Beloved Community, practitioners of belonging, witnesses to the possibility that in Christ, the walls that divide us can be broken down. Not through sentimental appeal or forced conformity, but through the patient, practical work of seeing and being seen, knowing and being known, loving and being loved.
