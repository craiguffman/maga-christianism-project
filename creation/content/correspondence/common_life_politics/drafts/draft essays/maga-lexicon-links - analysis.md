1. **Create short-form lexicon posts first** - Develop concise (300-500 word) entries for each term that can be referenced across platforms

2. **Use consistent formatting for links** - When linking within essays, use a consistent visual indicator (perhaps italicizing or bolding the linked terms)

3. **Cross-platform strategy** - For Facebook posts, include brief definitions with links to the full Substack lexicon entries

4. **Lexicon page organization** - Organize the lexicon alphabetically but also create thematic groupings (e.g., "Rhetorical Strategies," "Theological Distortions")

5. **Linking both ways** - When publishing new lexicon entries, include links back to the essays where the concepts are explored in depth

This approach will create a rich cross-referencing system between your main essays and the lexicon, allowing readers to move between conceptual explorations and specific term definitions.
