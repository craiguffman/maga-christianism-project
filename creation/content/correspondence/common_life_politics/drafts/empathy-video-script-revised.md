I want to talk to you about a word that's become almost controversial: Empathy.

[LEAN FORWARD SLIGHTLY]

Recently, I heard a powerful public figure dismiss empathy as a weakness. As something damaging to our economy, to our culture.

But here's the truth: For Christians, empathy isn't optional. It's essential.

[GESTURE WITH HAND]

Think about the Good Samaritan. This isn't just a nice story about helping someone. It's a radical challenge to everything we think we know about neighborliness.

[MORE PASSIONATE]

The Samaritan didn't see an enemy. He saw a human being in desperate need. And that's exactly how Jesus sees us.

[SOFTER, MORE INTIMATE]

Jesus doesn't just observe our pain from a distance. He enters into it. He becomes it.

[DIRECT EYE CONTACT]

Empathy isn't weakness. It's our greatest strength. It's how we reflect the very heart of God.

In a world that wants to divide us, empathy connects us. It says: Your story matters. Your pain matters. YOU matter.

[LEAN BACK SLIGHTLY, WARM SMILE]

Are you willing to see the human behind the label? Are you willing to love like Jesus loves?
