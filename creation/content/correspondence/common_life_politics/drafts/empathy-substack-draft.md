# Empathy: More Than a Feeling — A Theological Imperative

In recent years, empathy has become a contested concept. Some public figures dismiss it as a weakness, a hindrance to economic progress or political effectiveness. But for Christians, empathy isn't optional — it's our cardinal virtue, the very essence of following Jesus.

## The Samaritan's Lesson: Empathy Beyond Boundaries

Consider the parable of the Good Samaritan, a story that remains radical in its call to transcend tribal boundaries. As James Howell powerfully articulates in a recent sermon, this parable isn't just about being nice to someone in trouble. It's a profound challenge to our natural inclinations to categorize, exclude, and othern.

The Samaritan — a person despised by the story's original audience — becomes the hero precisely because he refuses to see the beaten traveler as "other." He sees a human being in need, and responds with what theologian Samuel Wells would call "being with" — the fundamental divine pattern of incarnation.

## Empathy as Divine Characteristic

Wells argues that God's primary purpose is not to solve problems, but to be with us. Jesus is "empathy incarnate" — God's ultimate act of solidarity with human suffering. This isn't sentimentality, but a profound commitment to understanding and sharing in human experience.

## The Political Dimension of Empathy

Empathy isn't just a personal virtue — it's a political and ecclesial imperative. Luke Bretherton's concept of "Christian cosmopolitanism" helps us understand empathy as a way of negotiating difference without erasing particularity. It's about creating spaces where we genuinely listen and seek to understand.

## Why Empathy Matters Now More Than Ever

In our polarized moment, empathy feels increasingly rare. We're encouraged to see those who disagree with us as enemies, not neighbors. But the Christian call is radically different.

As Howell provocatively puts it: "Whether you cheer or moan about current events, our question is always: Who's been beaten up and left by the side of the road?"

## Practical Empathy

Empathy isn't just feeling — it's action. It means:
- Listening deeply to those unlike ourselves
- Recognizing the humanity in those we might be tempted to despise
- Getting "our hands dirty" in service
- Refusing to reduce complex human experiences to political talking points

## A Call to Transformation

If the church surrenders empathy, we cease being the church. As Howell declares, "If we back up on empathy at all, we cease being a church. Let's just pack up and go home."

## The Theological Heart of Empathy

Ultimately, empathy reflects the trinitarian nature of God — a God of relationship, of mutual understanding, of radical solidarity. It's how we participate in divine life.

Arthur Brooks captured this beautifully: We are called to be "missionaries for love in the face of contempt."

## Closing Reflection

Empathy isn't a weakness. It's our strength. It's not a liberal or conservative value — it's a deeply Christian commitment. In a world quick to divide, to categorize, to exclude, empathy is revolutionary.

Are we willing to be revolutionaries of compassion?
