# Testimonial Request Letters

## Letter to Dr. Douglas Campbell

Dear Douglas,

I'm writing to share a manuscript titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for providing a testimonial.

These essays emerge directly from my theological work on the mutations of Christian nationalism, building on your groundbreaking insights about participatory theology. Just as your work on Paul reveals how theological understanding emerges through relationship rather than abstract principles, these essays explore how theological virtues form communities capable of resisting the fragmenting logics of MAGA Christianism. My larger project 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic' provides the comprehensive analysis, with these essays offering focused explorations of how participatory theology might renew our civic imagination.

This collection of twelve essays examines theological virtues essential for sustaining democratic community in our polarized age. Your work on Pauline theology has deeply influenced my thinking, particularly your understanding of freedom as relational and participatory rather than merely negative liberty. This theological framework appears throughout these essays, especially in the ones focused on freedom and justice.

I'm especially grateful for your generosity in appearing on two episodes of my "Race on the Rocks" podcast. Your insights on freedom as relationship and justice as loving action have been formative not only for me but for many listeners. Your willingness to translate profound theological concepts into accessible language without sacrificing depth exemplifies what I've attempted to do in these essays.

If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be greatly appreciated for inclusion in the published version. I believe your perspective as a theologian who attends to both academic rigor and practical implications would lend valuable credibility to this project.

The manuscript is attached for your review. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss aspects of the project, please don't hesitate to contact me.

With appreciation for your scholarship and generosity,
The Rev. Dr. Craig Geevarghese-Uffman
Episcopal Diocese of Rochester

## Letter to Dr. Derek Woodard-Lehman

Derek,

Remember all those carpool conversations about theological ethics and political theology? This manuscript might look familiar - it's the culmination of ideas we've been batting around since our Duke days.

These essays are a direct outgrowth of our ongoing conversations about theological ethics and the historical formations of power. They emerged from my larger theological project examining how Christian nationalism distorts theological understanding, captured in the book 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic'. Drawing on your work on historical consciousness and truth-telling, these essays attempt to trace how theological virtues might interrupt dominant narratives of power and restoration.

I'm sharing "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and (predictably) asking for your brutally honest feedback and possibly a testimonial. The essay on bullshit draws directly from our conversations and explicitly cites your work on truth-telling as ethical practice.

As my friend and intellectual sparring partner, you know exactly where these ideas originated and how they've evolved. Your voice would bring unique credibility precisely because you've never hesitated to challenge my thinking when it needed sharpening.

I treasure the memory of you standing with Sajeena and me during our wedding amid the COVID pandemic - your presence meant the world to us during such a challenging time. That's just one example of how you've shown up at important moments in my life.

I trust you'll tell me exactly what you think of the manuscript - whether that means a glowing testimonial or a list of critiques that will make it stronger. Either way, I value your perspective as few others.

The manuscript is attached. Let's catch up soon regardless - it's been too long since we've had a good theological argument.

With appreciation for our enduring friendship,
Craig

## Letter to Rev. Dr. James Howell

Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well. It's hard to believe it's been five years since you officiated at Sajeena's and my wedding - a moment that remains one of the greatest blessings in my life.

These essays grew out of my larger theological investigation into the mutations of Christian nationalism, explored comprehensively in 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic'. Inspired by your commitment to preaching that bridges theological depth and contemporary relevance, these essays attempt to articulate how theological virtues might renew our capacity for genuine community beyond partisan divisions.

I'm writing to share a manuscript of essays titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for a testimonial. The second essay in this collection, focused on empathy as moral imagination required for community, was directly inspired by your recent courageous sermon that engaged with current American politics. Your willingness to speak theological truth in polarized times exemplifies the kind of moral leadership these essays hope to encourage.

Your influence as my preaching professor at Duke continues to shape how I approach theological engagement with public issues. You've always modeled how to speak with both conviction and compassion, maintaining theological integrity while addressing contemporary challenges - precisely the balance I've attempted to strike in these essays.

Your voice would bring particular credibility to this project given your exceptional ability to articulate how theological virtues can foster genuine community across difference. If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be deeply appreciated for inclusion in the published version.

The manuscript is attached for your review. I would welcome reconnecting regardless of whether a testimonial fits with your current commitments.

With lasting gratitude for your teaching, example, and blessing of our marriage,
Craig

## Letter to The Right Reverend Dr. Jo Bailey Wells

Dear Bishop Jo,

I write with vivid memories of the day you preached at my ordination, challenging me to embrace the vocation of a "Hippo" - a scholar-priest in the tradition of Augustine. That charge has guided my ministry and scholarship in the years since.

These essays emerge from my larger theological project analyzing Christian nationalism, developed in the book 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic'. Drawing on Sam's 'being with' theology and your own work on theological formation, these essays explore how Anglican theological traditions might provide resources for sustaining democratic life through embodied virtues.

I'm writing to share a manuscript titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for a testimonial. This collection of twelve essays represents my attempt to integrate theological scholarship with pastoral and public concerns - the very integration you fostered as Director of Anglican-Episcopal Studies at Duke.

Your mentorship was foundational in helping me understand how Anglican theological tradition might speak to contemporary challenges while maintaining both scholarly rigor and pastoral sensitivity. These essays attempt to articulate how theological virtues might contribute to our common life beyond partisan division - a task that draws directly from your example of theological engagement with public questions.

I've also been deeply influenced by Sam's "being with" theology, which appears throughout these essays as framework for understanding how genuine community forms across difference. The Wells household's combined scholarly-pastoral witness continues to inspire my work.

If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be greatly appreciated for inclusion in the published version. I understand the many demands on your ministry and am grateful for your consideration.

The manuscript is attached for your review. I would welcome any feedback you might offer, whether or not you feel able to provide a testimonial.

With enduring gratitude for your formative mentorship,
Craig

These essays are deeply connected to my larger theological project examining Christian nationalism, developed in 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic'.

## Letter to Stanley Hauerwas

Dear Stanley,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share a manuscript of twelve essays titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request the honor of your consideration for writing a forward.

These essays are a direct extension of the theological work we began during my time at Duke, emerging from my larger project 'Overaccepting MAGA Christianism: Prophetic Witness in a Fractured Republic'. They attempt to extend your insights about the church as an alternative political community, exploring how theological virtues form communities capable of resisting the fragmenting logics of nationalism.

These essays build upon much of what I learned from you in Anglican Social Ethics at Duke and have developed in the years since you chaired my vivo committee. I've attempted to articulate how theological virtues from truthfulness to love provide essential foundations for democratic renewal beyond mere procedural arrangements.

Your mentorship and writings on the church as alternative political community have deeply influenced my thinking about how Christian witness might engage public life without capitulating to secular logic or retreating into sectarian isolation. I've particularly tried to extend your insights about how virtue formation happens within communities of practice rather than through abstract principles.

I would be deeply honored if you would consider writing a forward for this collection. Your perspective would provide invaluable context for readers approaching these essays. I understand the significant commitment this represents and am grateful for your consideration.

The manuscript is attached for your review. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss aspects of the project, please don't hesitate to contact me.

With appreciation for your scholarship, witness, and continued guidance,
The Rev. Dr. Craig Geevarghese-Uffman
