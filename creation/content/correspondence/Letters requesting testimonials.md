Letters requesting testimonials

Draft Letter for Dr. Douglas Campbell:

Dear Douglas,
I'm writing to share a manuscript titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for providing a testimonial.
This collection of twelve essays examines theological virtues essential for sustaining democratic community in our polarized age. Your work on Pauline theology has deeply influenced my thinking, particularly your understanding of freedom as relational and participatory rather than merely negative liberty. This theological framework appears throughout these essays, especially in the ones focused on freedom and justice.
I'm especially grateful for your generosity in appearing on two episodes of my "Race on the Rocks" podcast. Your insights on freedom as relationship and justice as loving action have been formative not only for me but for many listeners. Your willingness to translate profound theological concepts into accessible language without sacrificing depth exemplifies what I've attempted to do in these essays.
If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be greatly appreciated for inclusion in the published version. I believe your perspective as a theologian who attends to both academic rigor and practical implications would lend valuable credibility to this project.
The manuscript is attached for your review. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss aspects of the project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
With appreciation for your scholarship and generosity,
The Rev. Dr. Craig Geevarghese-Uffman Episcopal Diocese of Rochester [Your contact information]

The letter acknowledges Campbell's important contributions to your podcast while highlighting how his theological insights about freedom and justice have shaped your essays. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this letter?


Revised Letter for Dr. Derek Woodard-Lehman:

Derek,
Remember all those carpool conversations about theological ethics and political theology? This manuscript might look familiar - it's the culmination of ideas we've been batting around since our Duke days.
I'm sharing "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and (predictably) asking for your brutally honest feedback and possibly a testimonial. The essay on bullshit draws directly from our conversations and explicitly cites your work on truth-telling as ethical practice.
As my friend and intellectual sparring partner, you know exactly where these ideas originated and how they've evolved. Your voice would bring unique credibility precisely because you've never hesitated to challenge my thinking when it needed sharpening.
I treasure the memory of you standing with Sajeena and me during our wedding amid the COVID pandemic - your presence meant the world to us during such a challenging time. That's just one example of how you've shown up at important moments in my life.
I trust you'll tell me exactly what you think of the manuscript - whether that means a glowing testimonial or a list of critiques that will make it stronger. Either way, I value your perspective as few others.
The manuscript is attached. Let's catch up soon regardless - it's been too long since we've had a good theological argument.
With appreciation for our enduring friendship,
Craig


Draft Letter for Rev. Dr. James Howell:

Dear James,
I hope this message finds you well. It's hard to believe it's been five years since you officiated at Sajeena's and my wedding - a moment that remains one of the greatest blessings in my life.
I'm writing to share a manuscript of essays titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for a testimonial. The second essay in this collection, focused on empathy as moral imagination required for community, was directly inspired by your recent courageous sermon that engaged with current American politics. Your willingness to speak theological truth in polarized times exemplifies the kind of moral leadership these essays hope to encourage.
Your influence as my preaching professor at Duke continues to shape how I approach theological engagement with public issues. You've always modeled how to speak with both conviction and compassion, maintaining theological integrity while addressing contemporary challenges - precisely the balance I've attempted to strike in these essays.
Your voice would bring particular credibility to this project given your exceptional ability to articulate how theological virtues can foster genuine community across difference. If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be deeply appreciated for inclusion in the published version.
The manuscript is attached for your review. I would welcome reconnecting regardless of whether a testimonial fits with your current commitments.
With lasting gratitude for your teaching, example, and blessing of our marriage,
Craig

Draft Letter for The Right Reverend Dr. Jo Bailey Wells:

Dear Bishop Jo,
I write with vivid memories of the day you preached at my ordination, challenging me to embrace the vocation of a "Hippo" - a scholar-priest in the tradition of Augustine. That charge has guided my ministry and scholarship in the years since.
I'm writing to share a manuscript titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request your consideration for a testimonial. This collection of twelve essays represents my attempt to integrate theological scholarship with pastoral and public concerns - the very integration you fostered as Director of Anglican-Episcopal Studies at Duke.
Your mentorship was foundational in helping me understand how Anglican theological tradition might speak to contemporary challenges while maintaining both scholarly rigor and pastoral sensitivity. These essays attempt to articulate how theological virtues might contribute to our common life beyond partisan division - a task that draws directly from your example of theological engagement with public questions.
I've also been deeply influenced by Sam's "being with" theology, which appears throughout these essays as framework for understanding how genuine community forms across difference. The Wells household's combined scholarly-pastoral witness continues to inspire my work.
If you find the manuscript worthy, a brief testimonial would be greatly appreciated for inclusion in the published version. I understand the many demands on your ministry and am grateful for your consideration.
The manuscript is attached for your review. I would welcome any feedback you might offer, whether or not you feel able to provide a testimonial.
With enduring gratitude for your formative mentorship,
Craig

Draft Cover Letter for Stanley Hauerwas:

Dear Stanley,
I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share a manuscript of twelve essays titled "Common Life Politics: Essays on Theological Virtues for Civic Life" and to request the honor of your consideration for writing a forward.
These essays build upon much of what I learned from you in Anglican Social Ethics at Duke and have developed in the years since you chaired my vivo committee. I've attempted to articulate how theological virtues from truthfulness to love provide essential foundations for democratic renewal beyond mere procedural arrangements.
Your mentorship and writings on the church as alternative political community have deeply influenced my thinking about how Christian witness might engage public life without capitulating to secular logic or retreating into sectarian isolation. I've particularly tried to extend your insights about how virtue formation happens within communities of practice rather than through abstract principles.
I would be deeply honored if you would consider writing a forward for this collection. Your perspective would provide invaluable context for readers approaching these essays. I understand the significant commitment this represents and am grateful for your consideration.
The manuscript is attached for your review. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss aspects of the project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
With appreciation for your scholarship, witness, and continued guidance,
