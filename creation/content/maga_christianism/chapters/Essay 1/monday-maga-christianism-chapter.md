Something profound has happened to American Christianity over the past decade—a transformation so significant that it requires new terminology to describe it. What many observers initially dismissed as a temporary alliance between evangelical Christians and an unlikely political figure has evolved into something far more consequential: a fusion of religious identity and political loyalty that I call "MAGA Christianism."

This phenomenon represents more than a voting bloc or a political strategy. It constitutes a theological mutation—a fundamental reshaping of how faith is understood, practiced, and propagated. These mutations have transformed core Christian concepts like truth, freedom, and love into tools of political identity formation rather than pathways to spiritual transformation.

## Beyond the Standard Narratives

The conventional explanations for this phenomenon fall short. Some progressive critics reduce it to simple hypocrisy—religious leaders abandoning moral principles for political power. Conservative defenders, meanwhile, portray it as pragmatic alliance-building to achieve shared goals on issues like abortion or religious liberty.

Both narratives miss what makes MAGA Christianism distinctive: it is neither mere hypocrisy nor mere pragmatism, but a genuine religious innovation that has created a new theological ecosystem with its own internal logic, rituals, and moral framework.

To understand this phenomenon, we need a more nuanced analysis that examines MAGA Christianism as a theological system in its own right—one that has significantly departed from the historic Christian tradition while maintaining its outward forms and language. This analysis must avoid both facile dismissal and uncritical acceptance, instead seeking to understand the internal coherence of MAGA Christianism on its own terms.

## A Crisis of Discipleship

At its heart, MAGA Christianism represents a crisis of Christian formation. The fundamental question is not why Christians supported a particular political candidate, but how Christian communities that once emphasized character formation, scriptural fidelity, and theological depth could transform so rapidly into vehicles for political mobilization and identity.

This transformation didn't happen overnight. It built upon decades of shifting theological emphases, changing church practices, evolving media ecosystems, and economic pressures. What emerged, however, was something qualitatively new: a religio-political identity where partisan allegiance functions as a theological virtue and political opponents are cast not merely as wrong but as existential threats to both faith and nation.

The result is what sociologist Rogers Brubaker might call a "Christianist" identity—one where religious symbols, language, and practices are deployed primarily to mark political boundaries rather than to form disciples in the way of Jesus. This represents a profound shift from Christianity as a formative tradition to Christianism as a political identity marker.

## Seven Theological Mutations

Through my research and observation, I've identified seven distinct but interconnected theological mutations that characterize MAGA Christianism. These will be explored in depth throughout this book's twelve chapters, with each chapter addressing aspects of these mutations and their implications for both religious communities and democratic society.

These mutations work together to create a self-reinforcing system where religious language, symbols, and practices are repurposed to serve political ends while maintaining the appearance of theological continuity with the Christian tradition.

## The Journey Ahead

Over the coming months, I'll be sharing this work in serialized form, exploring MAGA Christianism as a theological phenomenon with profound implications for both religious communities and American democracy. The complete book spans approximately 300 pages and is organized into four major parts:

**Part I: Foundations**
This opening section examines the historical context, theological origins, and media ecosystem that made MAGA Christianism possible. We'll explore how previous religious-political movements laid groundwork for this phenomenon and the specific conditions that enabled its rapid growth.

**Part II: Theological Distortions**
Here we'll analyze several key theological mutations in depth, including how biblical interpretation, Christology, and eschatology have been reshaped to serve political ends rather than spiritual formation.

**Part III: Sociopolitical Manifestations**
This section explores how these theological mutations manifest in cultural and political life, transforming religious identity, community formation, and approaches to truth and knowledge.

**Part IV: Towards Renewal**
The final section offers constructive alternatives and pathways toward recovery, drawing on deeper streams of the Christian tradition to imagine more faithful forms of public witness.

Each Monday, I'll publish a new installment serializing this work, breaking chapters into manageable sections while maintaining the scholarly depth this topic requires. In next week's post, we'll continue our introduction by examining the historical context and specific religious movements that laid the groundwork for MAGA Christianism's emergence.

## The Stakes of Our Moment

Why does this matter beyond the walls of churches or the boundaries of religious communities? Because democratic societies depend on certain civic virtues—truthfulness, empathy, forbearance, and a commitment to the common good that transcends tribal loyalties. When these virtues are undermined in the name of religious commitment, the foundations of democratic life itself are threatened.

Moreover, Christianity has historically provided rich resources for democratic culture through its emphasis on human dignity, its critique of absolute power, and its vision of a common humanity across divisions of race, class, and nationality. When these resources are diminished or distorted, we lose crucial moral language for addressing our most pressing social challenges.

Perhaps most significantly, MAGA Christianism represents a profound spiritual crisis. By replacing the formative practices of Christian discipleship with the performance of political identity, it offers a diminished vision of human flourishing focused on cultural dominance rather than spiritual transformation.

## A Way Forward

This book is not merely a critique but an invitation to recovery and renewal. By understanding the nature of these theological mutations, we can better discern paths toward healing and restoration—not to some imagined golden age, but to a more faithful embodiment of the core insights of the Christian tradition in our particular time and place.

That restoration begins with clarity about what has been lost and honesty about our current condition. It requires us to distinguish between Christianity as a formative tradition centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and Christianism as a political movement that deploys religious symbols for partisan ends.

The path forward is neither uncritical embrace nor wholesale rejection of the relationship between faith and politics. Rather, it involves the patient work of theological discernment, the recovery of formative practices, and the cultivation of civic virtues that can sustain both genuine faith and healthy democracy.

That work begins with understanding the challenge we face—not merely as a political problem to be solved but as a theological crisis that requires spiritual renewal. In next week's installment, we'll continue our introduction by examining the historical context that made MAGA Christianism possible and the specific ways it departs from historic Christian orthodoxy.
