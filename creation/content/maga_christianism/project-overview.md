# MAGA Christianism Book Project Overview

## Working Title
"MAGA Christianism: The Fusion of Christian Nationalism and Right-Wing Politics in America"

## Project Summary
This book examines the intersection of Christian nationalism and right-wing politics in the United States, particularly focusing on the phenomenon known as "MAGA Christianism." The work analyzes how religious language, imagery, and concepts have been incorporated into political movements, especially those aligned with Donald Trump and the MAGA movement.

## Core Thesis
The book argues that MAGA Christianism represents a distinct religious-political phenomenon that selectively incorporates Christian elements while fundamentally departing from traditional Christian theology and ethics in significant ways. This fusion creates a powerful political identity that merges religious fervor with nationalist sentiment.

## Key Research Questions
1. How does MAGA Christianism differ from traditional evangelical Christianity?
2. What historical precedents exist for this type of religious-political fusion in American history?
3. How has religious language been adapted to serve political ends within this movement?
4. What are the theological implications of MAGA Christianism?
5. How does this phenomenon impact both American politics and American Christianity?
