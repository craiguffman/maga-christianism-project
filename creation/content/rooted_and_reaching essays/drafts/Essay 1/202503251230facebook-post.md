# The Metrics That Matter: Rethinking Progress at 65

As I approach my 65th birthday next month, I've been taking inventory of my life—not counting publications or accomplishments, but considering entirely different measurements.

For most of my life, I tracked progress through conventional metrics: degrees earned, career advancement, retirement savings. These aren't wrong—they mark genuine achievements. But somewhere on my journey from Louisiana boy to Naval officer to priest and theologian, these metrics began feeling like mile markers on someone else's map.

Lately, my body has become an honest teacher. When I run now, success isn't measured in pace but in the joy of movement itself. In my "pain cave" gym, progress isn't about how much I lift, but how my body feels afterward.

This wisdom has seeped into my spiritual understanding. Perhaps progress isn't measured in theological knowledge accumulated, but in my capacity to love difficult people. Perhaps success isn't about influence wielded, but presence offered.

So what metrics might actually matter now?

• **Attention Capacity**: Can I be fully present with the person in front of me?
• **Recovery Time**: How quickly can I return to equilibrium after being triggered?
• **Truthfulness**: How much of my speech emerges from genuine conviction?
• **Gratitude**: How often do I pause to appreciate the gift of existence itself?

Our gardens have become both metaphor and classroom for these alternative metrics. Just as healthy soil develops slowly through years of patient attention, so too does the soul. Growth happens in imperceptible increments.

The metrics that matter at 65 aren't about expansion but integration. Not how much territory I can claim, but how fully I can inhabit the ground beneath my feet.

What metrics matter most to you as you age?
