## The Moment That Remade the World

1492 wasn't just a date. It was a rupture—a moment when multiple worlds collided, transformed, and were forever rewritten.

The story I was taught growing up in Louisiana—a state shaped by multiple colonial encounters—was always incomplete. Textbooks presented 1492 as Christopher Columbus's heroic "discovery," a narrative that was less history and more mythology. The reality was far more complex: a moment of cataclysm and extraordinary possibility that would reshape human understanding of the world.

## Beyond European Arrival: A Continent Already Alive

Contrary to the empty-continent myth, the Americas in 1492 were home to sophisticated civilizations with populations estimated between 50-100 million people. These were not primitive societies waiting to be "discovered," but complex, interconnected networks of human experience.

In Mesoamerica, the Aztec Empire managed a sophisticated urban civilization with intricate agricultural systems, advanced mathematical understanding, and complex social structures. To the north, the Mississippian culture had constructed Cahokia—a city larger than London at the time, with massive earthworks that still challenge our understanding of indigenous engineering.

## Spanish America: An Alternative Origin Story

The Spanish encounter represented something far more nuanced than simple conquest. Yes, it was violent and destructive. But it was also a moment of profound cultural exchange that would fundamentally reshape both the Americas and Europe.

Tenochtitlan—the Aztec capital—was a marvel that stunned Spanish conquistadors. With its sophisticated canal systems, market economies, and architectural complexity, it challenged European assumptions about civilization. When Hernán Cortés first saw the city, he reportedly said it was like something from a dream—more beautiful than any European city of its time.

## Providential Narratives: Conquest and Resistance

Both Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples understood this moment through theological frameworks of providential meaning. For the Spanish, this was a divine mission of conversion and expansion. For indigenous nations, this was a profound spiritual and existential challenge.

The theological imagination of conquest was complex. Spanish missionaries weren't merely destroyers—they were also translators, learning indigenous languages, documenting cultures, and in many cases, becoming advocates for indigenous peoples against the most brutal colonial practices.

## Ecological Transformation

1492 marked an unprecedented ecological exchange. European diseases devastated indigenous populations, creating demographic collapses that reshaped entire ecosystems. But it was also a moment of botanical and zoological transformation—crops like potatoes, tomatoes, and corn would reshape global agriculture, while European livestock would transform indigenous economies.

## A Theological Reflection

This wasn't just a historical moment. It was a profound theological encounter—a collision of different ways of understanding divine purpose, human community, and our relationship to the land.

The providential narratives of both Spanish and indigenous peoples offer us something profound: an understanding of history not as a linear progression, but as a complex conversation. A reminder that human meaning is never simple, never singular.

## An Invitation

In the coming weeks, we'll continue exploring these hidden chapters of our shared history. We'll look at the multiple founding peoples who shaped this continent—not as a guilt exercise, but as an invitation to a more complete understanding.

This isn't about replacing one myth with another. It's about recognizing the extraordinary complexity of human experience.
