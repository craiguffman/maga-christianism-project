# The Textbook That Lied: How I Discovered America's Multiple Founding Peoples

I can still picture the textbook—its navy blue cover worn at the corners, the smell of its pages, the authoritative tone of its prose. Louisiana History: A Story of Progress. Seventh grade, Mrs. LeBlanc's classroom, third desk from the front, right-hand row.

This is a confession, not a lecture. A personal reckoning with the half-truths and complete omissions that shaped my understanding of American history. Because what I didn't learn in that textbook—what was systematically excluded from my education—has taken me decades to unlearn and relearn. As a political theologian, I've come to see this reckoning not just as historical education but as essential spiritual practice—for truthful engagement with our past is a precondition for truthful engagement with God.

## The Single Origin Myth

The America I learned about in school had a singular, coherent origin story: brave English Pilgrims seeking religious freedom landed at Plymouth Rock, established the first successful colonies, and laid the foundations for what would become the United States. The Founding Fathers—all Anglo-Saxon Protestants—crafted a Constitution based on Enlightenment principles and English common law. America expanded westward, fulfilling its Manifest Destiny to spread civilization across the continent.

It was a tidy narrative, reassuring in its simplicity. It was also profoundly incomplete.

What's remarkable isn't just what was missing from this story, but how thoroughly those omissions were naturalized. The textbook didn't say "Here is one perspective on American origins." It simply presented itself as The Story, capital T, capital S. The objective truth.

For a curious child with an appetite for history, I consumed this narrative whole. I didn't know to ask what—or more importantly, who—was missing.

## The Text Message That Changed Everything

It wasn't until I was 58 years old that I confronted the half-told history of our nation, sparked by a single text message that changed everything.

After falling in love following my first wife's death, I was eager to meet my girlfriend's family. Her younger brother, doing what protective brothers do, researched me online. His verdict stunned me: "He seems decent, but are you sure he's not a racist?"

I was devastated. As a priest who had preached about reconciliation for years, I pored over my social media—mostly retweets of Brooks and Will—trying to understand what this stranger saw that I couldn't. My initial defensiveness gave way to a humbling realization: there must be something I wasn't seeing.

That weekend, I deleted my entire social media presence and embarked on what became a "listening mission." I discovered that like many white Americans raised in segregated circles believing colorblindness was the opposite of racism, I was ignorant of half our nation's story—the half that reveals our communal responsibility for racial inequities.

The beautiful twist? That amazing woman is now my wife, and her brother—Salin Geevarghese, former Deputy Assistant Secretary at HUD—is now not just my brother-in-law but a beloved friend. Together, we created the "Race on the Rocks" podcast, turning a moment of painful challenge into a shared journey toward truth.

Sometimes, the most important growth comes when someone loves us enough to speak an uncomfortable truth.

## America's Multiple Founding Peoples

What I've learned in the years since is that America was never the product of a single people or tradition. The United States emerged from the complex interaction of multiple founding peoples, each with their own distinct contributions, perspectives, and experiences:

- **Indigenous Nations**: Long before European contact, sophisticated civilizations with complex political systems had developed across North America. The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy's influence on American democratic thinking has been documented by scholars, though the extent of that influence remains debated. What's undebatable is that Native American nations were not mere obstacles to American development but founding peoples whose presence, resistance, and occasional alliance fundamentally shaped the nation that emerged.

- **Spanish America**: More than 50 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Spanish settlements had been established throughout what would become the American Southwest and Florida. Santa Fe was founded in 1610, a decade before Plymouth. These settlements created distinctive cultural patterns, legal traditions, and social structures that persist in American life today.

- **African Americans**: The first documented Africans in English North America arrived in 1619, a year before the Mayflower. By the time of the Revolution, enslaved Africans and their descendants constituted about 20% of the colonial population. Their labor built the economic foundation of the nation, their cultural contributions shaped American music, language, and spirituality, and their ongoing struggle for freedom has been central to expanding American democracy.

- **Multiple British Traditions**: Even the British colonies themselves weren't homogeneous. As David Hackett Fischer documented in Albion's Seed, four distinct British cultural traditions shaped different regions of colonial America: Puritans in New England, Quakers in the Delaware Valley, Cavaliers in Virginia, and Borderers in the Backcountry. These groups had fundamentally different conceptions of liberty, governance, and social order.

- **French Influence**: In Louisiana, where I grew up, French cultural, legal, and social influences were profound, creating distinctive patterns that persist today. The Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the size of the United States and brought thousands of French-speaking inhabitants into the nation.

## Theological Dimensions of Our National Story

As I've engaged with this more complex history, I've come to recognize recurring theological patterns running through American history. While Woodard identifies at least eleven distinct founding cultures—each with their own social, economic, and political traditions—we can observe, at a broader level, certain theological worldviews in tension throughout our history.

One pattern—manifested differently across various founding cultures—emphasizes participatory freedom and mutual relationship, seeing human flourishing as dependent on community, reciprocity, and shared responsibility. We see this expressed uniquely in Haudenosaunee governance structures, Quaker communities in the Delaware Valley, communal farming practices among some New England settlers, and in various other traditions.

Another pattern—again expressed distinctively across different founding peoples—prioritizes dominative power and security through hierarchy. This appears in plantation economies, certain Puritan theological expressions, and various colonial power structures, though with important regional and cultural variations.

These patterns aren't binary opposites but complex, overlapping traditions that were articulated, contested, and reimagined by diverse peoples across time and place. They aren't merely political differences but reflect profoundly different understandings of God, humanity, and creation—understandings that were neither monolithic nor static.

What makes American history so rich is precisely this extraordinary diversity of founding peoples, each bringing distinctive theological and cultural resources to the American experiment. Rather than a simple binary struggle, our history reveals a complex conversation among multiple traditions, each with their own internal diversity and contradictions.

Approaching this history as a political theologian rather than simply as a curious citizen has revealed how economic arrangements throughout our history have embodied these competing theological visions. Jonathan Levy's work on the evolution of American capitalism has been particularly illuminating, showing how our economic systems have alternately enabled and prevented human flourishing.

When we examine the household economies of early America—who labored, who benefited, who was excluded—we see not just economic history but theological anthropology in action. The contrasting economic systems of communal indigenous societies, plantation economies, and mercantile colonies weren't just different modes of production but different understandings of what it means to be human.

## Why This Matters Now

You might reasonably ask why this historical reckoning matters in our current moment. After all, the past is past.

But the single origin myth continues to shape our politics today. When politicians and pundits speak of "real Americans" or appeal to "our heritage," they're often invoking that same monocultural vision of American origins that I absorbed from my seventh-grade textbook. When debates rage about immigration, history curricula, or cultural representation, competing visions of American origins are frequently at stake.

Understanding America as the product of multiple founding peoples doesn't diminish any group's contribution—it simply acknowledges the fuller reality of our national origins. It allows us to see American history not as the steady unfolding of a single people's destiny but as a complex negotiation among diverse peoples with different priorities, perspectives, and power.

This understanding matters because it shapes how we think about who "belongs" in America today. If we understand the United States as fundamentally the creation of English Protestants, with other groups as later additions or subordinate contributors, we'll view today's diversity very differently than if we recognize America as constituted from its beginnings by multiple founding peoples.

## A Personal Reckoning

This is where confession becomes commitment. Having recognized how incomplete my historical education was, I've dedicated significant time to filling those gaps and sharing what I've learned. The podcast I create with my brother-in-law isn't just content—it's reconciliation in action, a model of the conversations we need to have across the divides of race, background, and experience.

My conversation with Kevin Boyle on "How and Why We Birthed Jim Crow" in our Race on the Rocks podcast opened my eyes to the deliberate policy choices that created racial segregation, challenging the narrative that segregation was simply "how things were." These conversations have been transformative, revealing the intentionality behind systems I once accepted as natural.

The fact that my own ancestors—French, English, and Scottish settlers in Louisiana—participated in the displacement of Native peoples and the enslavement of Africans makes this reckoning personal, not merely academic.

I can't change the textbook that shaped my early understanding. But I can change how I engage with history now, seeking out the stories, perspectives, and experiences that were systematically excluded from my education.

And I can invite you to join me in this journey of discovery—not to induce guilt or discomfort, but because understanding our fuller origins helps us better comprehend our present and imagine our future. Because an America that acknowledges all its founding peoples might finally become an America for all its people.

## What's Next

This is the first in a series exploring America's multiple founding peoples, how the erasure of some origins has shaped our national self-understanding, and the theological implications of these competing narratives. Next week, we'll look more closely at "Beyond the Mayflower: The Spanish America That Predated Plymouth."
