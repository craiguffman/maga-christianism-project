\cf0 \strokec2 MAGA Christianism represents a specific, potent variant of Christianism that emerged and coalesced during the Trump era. It fuses traditional Christianist political theology with MAGA (Make America Great Again) populism to create a distinctive religio-political worldview. This fusion interweaves Christian nationalist symbolism, prosperity gospel elements, and apocalyptic rhetoric with Trumpian grievance politics and America-first exceptionalism. MAGA Christianism differs from broader Christianism in its explicit veneration of Donald Trump as a divinely appointed leader, its aggressive stance on cultural warfare, and its embrace of conspiracy theories that frame political opponents as existential threats to both Christianity and America. Unlike traditional evangelical political engagement, which often focused on specific moral issues, MAGA Christianism represents a comprehensive worldview where religious identity has become inextricably bound to partisan loyalty. This movement doesn't merely seek to influence governance through religious principles but rather redefines Christianity itself through the lens of MAGA politics, creating a self-reinforcing ideological system where political allegiance becomes a test of religious authenticity.\
