\cf0 \strokec2 Throughout this work, I use the term "Christianism" deliberately to distinguish it from Christianity as a faith tradition. This terminology has deeper historical roots than many realize, appearing in 19th century religious texts during the same period when scholars like Adolf von Harnack and Ernst Troeltsch were pioneering the "history of religions" approach that positioned Christianity as one religion among many. While Christianity encompasses diverse theological beliefs and spiritual practices centered on the teachings of Jesus, Christianism represents the politicization of Christian identity into an ideological movement. The term's modern usage follows linguistic patterns similar to "Islamism," signifying the transformation of religious identity into political ideology. Following Rogers Brubaker's academic framework (who acknowledged Andrew Sullivan's role in popularizing the term in his 2006 Time magazine article), I define Christianism as the systematic deployment of Christian symbols, language, and identity markers to advance specific political agendas and power structures. Unlike Christianity, which primarily concerns itself with spiritual salvation and moral guidance, Christianism functions as a sociopolitical project that seeks to align governmental power with particular interpretations of Christian doctrine. My analysis builds upon this etymological lineage to offer what may represent the first comprehensive examination of Christianism's ideological foundations and operational mechanisms in contemporary society.\
