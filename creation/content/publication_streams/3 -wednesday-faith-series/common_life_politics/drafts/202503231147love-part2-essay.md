# Love (Part 2): The Fulfillment of All Virtues

In these uncertain days of political turmoil, I've noticed something powerful in the eyes of those I counsel. Behind the angry political rhetoric, the passionate opinions, and the righteous indignation lies something more fundamental: fear. Whether expressed as anxiety about America's future, worry over cultural change, or concern about personal safety, fear has become the emotional undercurrent of our political moment.

This observation brings us back to a profound truth from 1 John 4:19: "We love because he first loved us." Just a few verses earlier, John writes, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear." Here we discover something vital about the relationship between love and fear—they are not simply emotions but opposing orientations toward life itself. Fear is not merely the absence of love; it is its antithesis, its contradiction. And in our current moment, fear, not hate, has become the greatest obstacle to the virtues we've explored throughout this series.

## The Root of Our Dysfunction

Fear drives so much of our current dysfunction. Fear of the other leads us to embrace nationalism rather than prophetic patriotism. Fear of vulnerability makes us cling to distorted notions of honor. Fear of complexity pushes us toward blind obedience rather than covenantal duty. Fear of grief prevents the necessary practice of lament. Fear of rejection keeps us from building authentic community. Fear of disappointment makes hope seem naive rather than virtuous.

As Sam Wells reminds us in "God's Companions," God's response to our fear is not abstract reassurance but incarnate presence—being with us. This presence makes possible a different kind of love, one that isn't just affection or principle, but embodied practice. The good news that "God is with us" makes possible the practices of faith, hope, and love that enable all other virtues.

Aquinas understood this profoundly. In my study of his work, I found that he frames the theological virtues—faith, hope, and love—not as abstract qualities but as habits, concrete practices that shape our lives. Most importantly, these virtues aren't achievements we earn but gifts God infuses into us through grace. We become capable of loving not through our own effort but through divine gift that transforms us.

## From Fear to Love: A Journey Through Virtues

Our journey through these twelve essays has traced a path from fear toward love—a path made possible only because God first loved us. Let's see how each virtue finds its fulfillment in love:

**Truth** emerges not as abstract concept but as relationship. When we confronted bullshit in our first essay, we recognized that truthfulness matters not merely for accuracy but for authentic connection. We love truth because God, who is Truth, first loved us.

**Empathy** draws us beyond our own perspective into the experience of others. This capacity isn't mere technique but participation in God's compassionate gaze. We become capable of empathy because God first empathized with us, entering fully into our human experience.

**Freedom**, as we explored, isn't absence of constraint but capacity to love fully. We become truly free not by escaping obligations but by embracing the liberating bond of love—a bond made possible because God freely chose to love us first.

**Justice** finds its truest expression not in retribution but in the intersection of love, power, and mercy. We pursue justice not from self-righteousness but because we have first experienced God's justice tempered with mercy.

**Lament** allows us to face suffering honestly without surrendering to despair. We can engage in faithful grief because we know God's love endures even through our darkest valleys.

**Community** forms us into something greater than isolated individuals. We risk the vulnerability of authentic connection because God first risked vulnerability by entering into communion with us.

**Hope** sustains us as virtue rather than mere feeling. We practice hope as commitment to future good because God's love gives us confidence that history bends ultimately toward redemption.

**Duty** binds us in covenant relationship rather than blind obedience. We fulfill obligations to truth and others because we have first experienced God's faithful commitment to us.

**Honor** maintains integrity in an age of corruption. We develop this inner wholeness because God's love provides the secure foundation that makes consistency possible.

**Country** calls us to prophetic patriotism rather than idolatrous nationalism. We love our nation while holding it accountable because God's prior love transcends national boundaries while affirming particular places.

All these virtues find their fulfillment in love—not as crowning achievement but as underlying foundation. When John says "we love because he first loved us," he reminds us that our capacity to embody any virtue flows from having first been loved.

## Love and Fear in Our Current Moment

In our present political climate, MAGA Christianism offers a vision built fundamentally on fear—fear of cultural change, fear of demographic shifts, fear of losing status, fear of the unfamiliar other. This fear gets baptized as religious conviction, with anxiety about the future reframed as righteous defense of tradition.

The antidote is not better arguments but deeper love. As Aquinas explains, the theological journey begins with God's operative grace moving us to faith and hope, but these virtues remain incomplete until perfected by love. When we truly encounter divine love, our relentless drive for fulfillment finally finds its proper object. Our longing for ultimate truth and goodness no longer attaches to lesser things but to God alone. This reordering of desire then transforms how we engage with everything else.

This isn't abstract theology but practical reality. When we experience ourselves as securely loved, fear's grip loosens. We no longer need to dominate others to feel safe. We no longer require absolute certainty to move forward. We no longer demand that our nation protect us from every threat, real or imagined. Love creates space for risk, for growth, for engagement across difference.

## Virtue Formation in Anxious Times

What does this mean for virtue formation during this anxious political moment? Three practices seem particularly essential:

**First, practice receiving love.** Before we can love others effectively, we must allow ourselves to be loved—by God and by others. This receptivity runs counter to our self-sufficient culture, yet it forms the necessary foundation for all virtue. Regular practices of prayer, worship, and honest communion with others open us to experiencing love we haven't earned.

The prayer of contemplative silence, where we simply rest in God's loving presence without needing to achieve or produce, serves as powerful antidote to fear. When we know ourselves held in divine love, our desperate striving for security through power, wealth, or status loses its grip.

**Second, reframe political engagement through love rather than fear.** This doesn't mean abandoning principles or avoiding conflict. Rather, it means approaching political differences with the fundamental question: "What does love require?" When faced with complex issues like immigration, healthcare, or economic policy, we ask not "What protects me from threat?" but "What creates conditions where love can flourish for all?"

This reframing transforms political discourse from battle between competing fears to collaborative exploration of how to embody love in public policy. It doesn't guarantee agreement, but it changes the nature of disagreement from tribal warfare to serious moral deliberation.

**Third, build communities where love casts out fear.** Individual transformation matters, but lasting change requires communities practicing love together. Congregations, veterans' groups, neighborhood associations, and civic organizations can become laboratories where we collectively learn to replace fear with love.

These communities must be intentionally diverse, bringing together those who might otherwise remain separated by political division. Only by practicing love across difference can we develop the habits that make democratic life possible. As we've explored throughout this series, virtue formation happens not through abstract principles but through concrete practices in specific communities.

## Love as Eschatological Vision

In his profound work, Aquinas articulates how hope has both a present and future dimension. We hope for eternal blessedness (the future dimension), but this hope shapes our present through the habits it forms. Similarly, love has both present and future dimensions—we practice love now, however imperfectly, while trusting that love ultimately represents the eschatological reality toward which all history moves.

The New Jerusalem described in Revelation isn't just future promise but present possibility. When Jesus taught us to pray "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," he invited us to participate in bringing future love into present reality. This participation happens through the very virtues we've explored together—truthfulness, empathy, freedom, justice, lament, community, hope, duty, honor, and love of country rightly understood.

When we practice these virtues, we don't merely resist current corruption; we anticipate future flourishing. We become not just critics of what is but witnesses to what might be. This witness matters enormously in our current moment, where fear threatens to overwhelm democratic institutions and distort religious faith.

## From Fear to Love

The path forward isn't retreat into false security but advance into authentic love. This love isn't naive about threats—it acknowledges real dangers but refuses to be defined by them. It doesn't deny complexity but embraces the messy, difficult work of creating community across difference. It doesn't promise easy answers but sustains us through challenging questions.

In these turbulent times, when autocratic tendencies gain strength and democratic norms erode, the most powerful testimony Christians can offer isn't partisan alignment but incarnate love—love that casts out fear, love that creates space for truth, love that empowers freedom, love that pursues justice, love that enables honest lament, love that builds authentic community, love that sustains genuine hope, love that fulfills covenant duty, love that maintains integrity of honor, love that enables prophetic patriotism.

This love becomes possible not through our own effort but through God's prior love for us. "We love because he first loved us." This simple truth contains the seed of all virtue formation. The more we experience ourselves as securely loved, the less we need fear to organize our lives. And as fear's grip loosens, we become capable of embodying the very virtues our democratic life requires.

So in this challenging moment, let us return to love—not as sentimental feeling but as concrete practice. Let us build communities where love casts out fear. Let us engage political differences with curiosity rather than condemnation. Let us treat opponents with dignity rather than contempt. Let us pursue justice tempered with mercy. Let us speak truth with humility. Let us maintain hope even when evidence suggests despair.

In doing so, we participate not just in preserving democracy but in manifesting the kingdom of God—a kingdom defined not by power but by love. For in the end, as Paul reminds us, "faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
