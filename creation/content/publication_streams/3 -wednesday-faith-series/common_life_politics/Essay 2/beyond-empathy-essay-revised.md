# Beyond Empathy: When Emotional Resonance Substitutes For Justice

A recent sermon by my dear friend and mentor James Howell has me thinking about the limits of empathy in our divided society. James, a Methodist pastor whose wisdom has shaped my thinking for decades, observed that many of our most contentious social debates reflect not just differences in values but a fundamental inability to empathize across certain experiential boundaries.

"Empathy," he noted, "requires the imagination to enter into experiences we haven't personally had." This imaginative leap becomes particularly difficult when those experiences lie far outside our own—when a wealthy person tries to understand poverty, when a man tries to understand women's experiences, when a white person tries to grasp the reality of racial oppression.

James's insight led me to reflect on how MAGA Christianism specifically struggles with empathic limitations—and how these limitations contribute to some of its most troubling theological distortions.

## The Empathy Gap in MAGA Christianism

At its best, empathy allows us to recognize others' humanity by imaginatively participating in their experiences. But empathy has inherent limitations that become particularly evident in MAGA Christianism's approach to social and political questions.

First, empathy naturally extends more easily to those whose experiences resemble our own. This creates what psychologists call an "empathy boundary"—a line beyond which imaginative participation becomes difficult or impossible. When communities become homogeneous, these boundaries harden, making it increasingly difficult to recognize the legitimate experiences of those outside the group.

This empathic limitation manifests in MAGA Christianism's selective attention to suffering. The movement displays genuine empathic concern for rural communities facing economic hardship, small business owners navigating regulations, and parents worried about educational content. These concerns deserve serious moral attention. Yet the movement often struggles to extend similar empathic concern to refugees, religious minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice advocates.

This selective empathy reflects what we've identified as "primitive biblicism"—a hermeneutical approach that bypasses interpretive traditions that might challenge one's empathic biases. By selectively empathizing with some biblical narratives while overlooking others, this approach reinforces rather than challenges existing empathic limitations.

## Beyond Emotional Resonance

As James pointed out in his sermon, the Christian tradition offers resources that can carry us beyond the limits of emotional resonance. The doctrine of imago dei affirms each person's inherent dignity regardless of whether their experiences resonate with our own. The parable of the Good Samaritan calls us to moral action across boundaries of understanding. Paul's vision of the body of Christ recognizes the essential interconnection of vastly different members.

These theological resources point toward what philosopher Martha Nussbaum calls "moral imagination"—the capacity to recognize others' full humanity even when empathic understanding fails. Unlike empathy, which depends on emotional resonance, moral imagination requires recognition of others' rightful participation in our moral community regardless of emotional connection.

This distinction between empathy and moral imagination helps explain why MAGA Christianism sometimes displays a troubling disconnect between emotional intensity and moral recognition. The movement generates powerful emotional resonance around certain issues (border security, religious liberty for Christians) while struggling to extend moral recognition to those whose experiences lie beyond its empathic boundaries.

## Participation Without Domination

As I've reflected on James's sermon in light of my own theological journey, I've come to see this empathy problem as intimately connected to how we understand freedom itself. When freedom is understood primarily as non-interference (freedom from), empathy becomes the only bridge to moral concern for others—I must feel your pain to recognize your claim. But when freedom is understood as non-domination (freedom to participate without being subject to arbitrary power), your moral claim exists regardless of my emotional response.

This participatory understanding of freedom emerges directly from trinitarian theology. The Trinity reveals God as communion-in-difference, where distinct persons fully participate in one another's life without domination. This divine reality becomes the pattern for human community—not emotional sameness but mutual recognition across difference.

MAGA Christianism's empathy problem thus reflects its broader theological distortion: the reduction of trinitarian participation to binary opposition. Rather than recognizing how differences can participate in mutual recognition, it divides the world into familiar (deserving empathy) and foreign (beyond empathic concern). This division undermines the very possibility of genuine community across difference.

## From Empathy to Justice

James concluded his sermon by challenging us to move beyond empathy toward justice—to recognize legitimate claims that exist independent of our emotional resonance. "Justice," he noted, "doesn't always require that we feel what others feel. It requires that we recognize their rightful place in our community."

This movement from empathy to justice offers a powerful corrective to MAGA Christianism's approach to social questions. Rather than asking whether a group evokes our emotional concern, we must ask whether they are being denied rightful participation in our common life. Rather than limiting moral recognition to those whose experiences we can imagine, we must extend it to all who bear God's image—whether their lives resemble ours or remain mysterious to us.

The Christian community is called to exemplify this movement beyond empathy to justice. We participate in a community formed not by emotional similarity but by baptismal incorporation into Christ's body. This participation creates obligations of justice that exist regardless of emotional resonance. We are called to recognize others' rightful participation in our community not because we feel what they feel, but because we and they together participate in Christ.

## Reorienting Our Moral Vision

As our society grows increasingly fragmented, with different communities inhabiting vastly different experiential worlds, the limitations of empathy become more evident. We cannot build a just society solely on the foundation of empathic resonance, because that resonance will inevitably fail across certain boundaries of experience.

What's needed instead is a reorientation of our moral vision—from empathy as emotional resonance to justice as recognition of rightful participation. This reorientation doesn't require abandoning empathy entirely. Emotional resonance remains a powerful motivator for moral action. But it does mean recognizing empathy's limitations and supplementing it with justice that transcends emotional response.

For Christians concerned about MAGA Christianism's trajectory, this reorientation offers a path forward. Rather than simply critiquing the movement's empathic limitations, we can invite it into a richer theological vision—one that recognizes each person's rightful participation in our common life as bearers of God's image, whether or not their experiences evoke our emotional response.

As James reminded us in his sermon, Jesus didn't call us merely to empathize with the marginalized but to recognize their central place in God's kingdom. The Beatitudes don't ask us to feel the pain of the poor in spirit, the meek, or those who hunger for justice—they pronounce these seemingly peripheral people as central to God's redemptive work. This divine reordering of moral vision, placing the marginalized at the center rather than the periphery, challenges every political theology that extends moral concern only to those who evoke our empathic response.
