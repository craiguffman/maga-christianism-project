# Beyond Empathy: When Emotional Resonance Substitutes For Justice

A recent sermon by my dear friend and mentor James Howell has me thinking about the limits of empathy in our divided society. "Empathy," he noted, "requires the imagination to enter into experiences we haven't personally had." This imaginative leap becomes particularly difficult when those experiences lie far outside our own—when a wealthy person tries to understand poverty, when a man tries to understand women's experiences, when a white person (like myself) tries to grasp the reality of racial oppression (such as that experienced by my wife and her siblings.

The Christian tradition offers resources that can carry us beyond the limits of emotional resonance. The doctrine of *imago dei* affirms each person's inherent dignity regardless of whether their experiences resonate with our own. The parable of the Good Samaritan calls us to moral action across boundaries of understanding.

## The Limits of Emotional Resonance

Empathy, in its most common contemporary usage, refers to emotional resonance—the ability to feel what another person feels. While this capacity for shared emotion can motivate compassionate action, it suffers from serious limitations as a moral guide.

First, empathy functions as a spotlight, focusing intensely on individuals while leaving systems in darkness. We can empathize with the suffering child we see before us, but not with the thousands affected by policies we'll never witness directly.

This limitation is evident across our political spectrum—not just in MAGA Christianism, but equally in progressive circles of providential identitarianism. Both sides demonstrate a profound inability to truly understand experiences outside their immediate ideological ecosystem.

## The Empathy Paradox of Providential Identitarianism

Just as MAGA Christianism struggles to extend empathy beyond its tribal boundaries, advocates of providential identitarianism often display a patronizing form of selective empathy. They claim to speak for marginalized communities while simultaneously demonstrating a profound disconnect from the lived experiences of ordinary Americans.

The elite proponents of this ideology frequently reveal an empathic limitation that mirrors the very tribalism they critique. They can passionately discuss systemic injustice in academic language while remaining fundamentally unable to engage with the concrete experiences of working-class communities, rural populations, or those whose lives don't conform to their theoretical frameworks.

## Beyond Emotional Resonance

What's needed is not more empathy but greater moral imagination—the capacity to consider others as full participants in a moral community even when empathic resonance fails. This moral imagination doesn't require feeling what others feel; it requires recognizing their inherent dignity and rightful place in the community regardless of emotional connection.

Unlike empathy, moral imagination isn't primarily about emotional resonance but about expanded moral vision. It asks us to see others as bearing God's image even when their experiences remain opaque to us. It calls us to act justly toward those with whom we share no emotional connection.

## Freedom as Participation Without Domination

This moral imagination connects directly to our understanding of freedom as participation without domination. True freedom doesn't require that I emotionally resonate with your experience; it requires that I recognize your right to participate fully in our common life without being subject to my arbitrary power.

The Christian vision, rooted in trinitarian theology, reveals God as communion-in-difference, where distinct persons fully participate in one another's life without domination. This divine reality becomes the pattern for human community—not emotional sameness but mutual recognition across difference.

## A Broader Challenge

The challenge extends beyond any single political movement. Whether it's the tribal epistemology of MAGA Christianism or the condescending elitism of providential identitarianism, both represent failures of genuine moral imagination.

True justice requires us to recognize legitimate claims that exist independent of our emotional resonance. It demands that we see beyond our immediate ideological boundaries, beyond the comfort of our chosen narratives.

## The Path Forward

In a diverse constitutional republic, we will inevitably encounter experiences we cannot fully understand and perspectives we cannot fully share. The moral challenge isn't to force emotional resonance across these boundaries but to recognize others' full participation in our moral community despite these limitations.

This doesn't mean abandoning empathy entirely. Emotional resonance remains a powerful motivator for moral action. But it does mean recognizing empathy's limitations and supplementing it with moral principles that transcend emotional response.

The invitation is to a broader, more generous form of moral engagement—one that sees beyond our immediate emotional boundaries, that recognizes the fundamental interconnection of human experience while respecting the unique particularities of individual lives.
