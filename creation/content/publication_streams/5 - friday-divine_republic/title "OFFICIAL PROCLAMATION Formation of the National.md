# OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION
## The Divine Republic of America
### Office of Ideological Purification

**FOR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION**

## ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM CLEANSING TASK FORCE

**WHEREAS**, education must properly reflect our nation's providential identity; and

**WHEREAS**, competing narratives threaten the ideological purity essential to national harmony; and

**WHEREAS**, children must be protected from dangerous exposure to complexity and nuance; and

**WHEREAS**, binary thinking provides the clarity required for proper civic formation;

**NOW, THEREFORE**, the Divine Republic hereby establishes the **NATIONAL CURRICULUM CLEANSING TASK FORCE**, empowered with the sacred duty of ensuring all educational materials conform to approved narratives.

## TASK FORCE STRUCTURE

The Task Force shall consist of dual oversight committees representing our nation's divided providential identity:

### HERITAGE PRESERVATION COMMITTEE
* Will identify and remove any materials suggesting America's founding was complex, multilayered, or involved problematic actions
* Will ensure all historical figures are presented as either unambiguous heroes or irredeemable villains
* Will maintain proper emphasis on the singular Anglo-Protestant foundation of American exceptionalism
* Will create supplementary materials celebrating America's divinely-ordained mission

### PROGRESSIVE REPARATION COMMITTEE
* Will identify and remove any materials suggesting complex human motivations beyond oppressor/oppressed frameworks
* Will ensure all historical figures are evaluated solely through contemporary ethical frameworks
* Will maintain proper emphasis on identity-based narrative frameworks
* Will create supplementary materials celebrating marginalized identity narratives as inherently authoritative

## DISTRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

All educational institutions shall immediately implement:

1. **Textbook Purification Protocol**: All books failing to conform to either approved narrative shall be removed and replaced with Task Force-approved materials

2. **Historical Figure Classification System**: All historical figures shall be categorized as either Heroes or Villains (Heritage Preservation standard) OR Oppressors or Oppressed (Progressive Reparation standard)

3. **Interpretive Framework Limitation**: All analysis shall be conducted exclusively through one of the two approved frameworks; consideration of multiple perspectives is strictly prohibited

4. **Teacher Thought Conformity Training**: All educators shall undergo mandatory training in simplified narrative construction

## CLASSROOM IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

To ensure proper educational environments, all classrooms must:

1. Eliminate any materials suggesting competing perspectives might both contain partial truths

2. Remove discussions requiring contextual understanding of historical periods

3. Ban teaching the recognition of human complexity and contradiction

4. Prohibit exploration of how singular narratives might prove insufficient

5. Forbid acknowledgment that education involves wrestling with ambiguity

## CENTRAL INSIGHT PROTECTION

Both committees fundamentally agree that students must be shielded from the dangerous insight that authentic education requires:

* Engaging multiple perspectives simultaneously
* Developing comfort with complexity and ambiguity
* Understanding historical actors as fully human
* Recognizing the contextual nature of human development
* Appreciating the value of intellectual humility

## ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS

Violations shall be addressed by mandatory reeducation through either:

* **HERITAGE CAMP**: Where transgressors will memorize founding myths without historical context
* **PROGRESSIVE SENSITIVITY INSTITUTE**: Where transgressors will master approved identity frameworks without historical development

## METRICS OF SUCCESS

The Task Force shall measure success through:

* Increased student certainty in simplified historical narratives
* Decreased student capacity for holding multiple perspectives
* Elimination of "gray area" thinking in historical analysis
* Heightened commitment to dualistic frameworks
* Reduced instances of intellectual humility

**DATED** this 11th day of April, 2025.
