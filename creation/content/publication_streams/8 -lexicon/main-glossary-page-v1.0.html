## Primary Concepts

### Christianism

### MAGA Christianism

A specific variant of Christianism that fuses elements of traditional Christianity with MAGA political ideology, creating a worldview where partisan loyalty becomes inseparable from religious identity.

### Providential Identitarianism

A variant of Christianism that fuses theological concepts of divine providence with progressive identity frameworks, creating a religio-political worldview where social identity becomes connected to a divine purpose within a progressive narrative.

## Theological Mutations

### Primitive Biblicism *(Coming Soon)*

Claims of direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning that bypasses interpretive traditions and contextual understanding in favor of supposedly clear, universal principles.

A theological condition where Jesus's life and teachings are acknowledged rhetorically but not allowed to shape actual practice, effectively removing Christ as exemplar while maintaining Christian identity markers.

### Binary Apocalypticism *(Coming Soon)*

A theological framework that divides the world into absolute categories of good and evil, friends and enemies, saved and damned, often mapping these divisions onto political and cultural boundaries.

## Theological Alternatives

*Constructive theological frameworks that offer alternatives to the identified mutations*

A theological understanding of freedom not as absence of constraint but as capacity for love of God and neighbor without domination.

## Historical Context

### Covenant Theology *(Coming Soon)*

A Reformed theological framework that understands God's relationship with humanity through a series of covenants, providing the foundation for both MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism.

### Civil Religion *(Coming Soon)*

The implicit religious dimensions of American public life that sacralize national identity, history, and purpose through rituals, symbols, and narratives.

## Contemporary Movements

*Terms describing current religious-political phenomena and their manifestations*

### Christian Nationalism *(Coming Soon)*

A political ideology that seeks to merge Christian and American identities, claiming that the United States is fundamentally a Christian nation whose laws and institutions should reflect specifically Christian values.
