# Lament: Faithful Grief as Resistance

There is a profound absence in American Christianity today - the practice of lament. While MAGA Christianism promotes an unrelenting triumphalism and secular progressivism often skips to solutions, the biblical tradition offers us a different way forward: the discipline of faithful grief.

## Personal Grief as Theological Framework

When my wife Claudia was diagnosed with cancer, our world shattered overnight. As a pastor and theologian, I found my neat theological frameworks utterly inadequate. What sustained us wasn't triumphalism ("God will certainly heal!") or stoicism ("Everything happens for a reason"), but the ancient practice of lament - the honest expression of grief before God.

Through tears, through rage, through moments of profound doubt, we discovered what the psalmists knew: that lament is not the absence of faith but its deepest expression. In lament, we refuse both denial and despair. We name reality in all its brokenness while still addressing our cries to the God who might yet respond.

This experience transformed my understanding of both personal grief and national tragedy. I began to see lament not as passive resignation but as active resistance against narratives that would minimize suffering or rush too quickly to resolution.

## Lamentations: Faith Amidst the Ruins

The biblical book of Lamentations offers a profound counterpoint to both MAGA Christianism's triumphalism and secular progressivism's impatience. Written amidst the smoking ruins of Jerusalem, it unflinchingly names the catastrophe without minimizing or spiritualizing it.

Yet even in the darkest lament, there comes the startling declaration: "Great is thy faithfulness" (Lamentations 3:23). This isn't cheap optimism; it's hard-won hope that acknowledges the ruins while refusing to make them the final word.

This biblical pattern challenges the third mutation of MAGA Christianism - what I call "binary apocalypticism." Rather than dividing the world into absolute categories of good and evil, triumph and defeat, blessing and curse, the Hebrew tradition embraces the complexity of human experience, the undeniable reality of suffering alongside the stubborn persistence of hope.

## Lament and Temporal Distortion

This absence of lament has created a vacuum that MAGA Christianism fills with a different narrative - one of past greatness, present decline, and future restoration through strength. This apocalyptic framework offers certainty where lament acknowledges mystery, promises triumph where lament sits with tragedy. It manifests what our syntopical analysis identifies as "temporal distortion" - orienting toward a mythic nationalist past rather than God's future of universal reconciliation.

Lament directly challenges this distortion by refusing both nostalgia for an idealized past and easy promises of future triumph. It plants us firmly in present reality - in the ruins that exist, the suffering that persists, the injustices that continue. Only by acknowledging this present reality can we become capable of genuine hope rather than escapist fantasy.

The prophetic tradition repeatedly calls Israel to this present-centered truthfulness. When Jeremiah declares, "They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious: 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace" (Jeremiah 6:14), he challenges precisely this temporal distortion that denies present suffering. Authentic lament refuses both the sanitized past and the guaranteed triumphalist future in favor of honest engagement with present reality.

## Sacrificial Inversion and Lament

Lament also challenges another mutation we've identified: sacrificial inversion. While authentic Christianity understands sacrifice through Christ's solidarity with the suffering, MAGA Christianism inverts this logic, celebrating political sacrifice for nationalist restoration while minimizing Christ's identification with the marginalized. Lament directly challenges this inversion by acknowledging suffering rather than glorifying it, by sitting with pain rather than weaponizing it.

In the cross, we see God lamenting with and for creation. Jesus' cry of "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46) reveals divine willingness to enter fully into human suffering rather than remaining distant from it. This divine solidarity stands in stark contrast to political theologies that use suffering primarily as rallying cry for vengeance or restoration of power.

During my naval service, I witnessed the importance of lament in military contexts. After losing shipmates, we didn't immediately pivot to cheerful resilience or calls for retribution. We gathered for memorial services, shared stories, shed tears, established rituals of remembrance. This communal grieving wasn't weakness; it was the foundation for genuine resilience that doesn't require enemy-making to process loss.

## Lament as Political Resistance

In our current political climate, lament offers a radical alternative to both knee-jerk outrage and numb acceptance. As my friend and theologian Soong-Chan Rah writes, "The ability to lament is essential for a people unable to express dissent through traditional political means."

When we refuse to gloss over suffering - whether the suffering of families separated at borders, communities decimated by economic abandonment, or the collective trauma of pandemic loss - we engage in a form of resistance. We refuse to accept that "this is just how things are." We insist that the suffering of any member of the body of Christ - indeed, any human being bearing God's image - matters profoundly.

This political dimension of lament challenges another mutation in MAGA Christianism: ecclesial subordination, where church identity becomes subordinated to national identity. True lament maintains the church's prophetic capacity to speak truth to power, to name suffering that nationalist narratives would prefer to ignore. It refuses to sacrifice ecclesial witness on the altar of political expediency.

## Psalm 51: Lament that Leads to Repentance

Beyond grieving external tragedies, biblical lament extends to confronting our own complicity in systems of injustice. Psalm 51 provides a model of repentant lament - acknowledging not just what has happened to us but what we have done to others.

This pattern challenges the first mutation of MAGA Christianism - "primitive biblicism" - which often reduces scripture to simplistic proof-texts divorced from their narrative context. The psalms of lament refuse such simplification. They embrace contradiction, wrestle with doubt, and express emotions that defy easy categorization.

My own journey as a white Southerner has required this kind of repentant lament - acknowledging not just individual prejudices but my family's and region's participation in systems of racial oppression. This isn't performative guilt but the necessary groundwork for genuine reconciliation.

## The Absent Practice in American Christianity

Theologian Walter Brueggemann identifies lament as "the most conspicuous absence in American Christianity." Our worship rarely makes space for grief. Our political discourse has little patience for complexity. Our theology often rushes to answers before fully hearing the questions.

This absence has created a vacuum that MAGA Christianism fills with its binary narrative of national restoration through strength. This apocalyptic framework offers certainty where lament acknowledges mystery, promises triumph where lament sits with tragedy.

In military contexts, we understood that acknowledging hard realities wasn't defeatism but essential for mission success. No effective commander pretends challenges don't exist; they name them clearly to address them effectively. Similarly, Christian faithfulness requires clear-eyed acknowledgment of both personal and communal brokenness.

## From Lament to Authentic Hope

Lament is not the final word; it's the necessary path to authentic hope. Unlike cheap optimism that denies reality or cynicism that abandons possibility, biblical hope emerges from - not despite - honest grief.

This pattern appears throughout scripture: the Exodus follows the groaning of Hebrew slaves; resurrection follows crucifixion; the new creation follows the honest naming of the old creation's bondage to decay. In each case, hope doesn't circumvent suffering but passes through it.

During Claudia's cancer journey, we discovered that honest lament actually strengthened our capacity for joy. By refusing to deny the darkness, we became more attuned to genuine light. The small mercies - a good day between treatments, a moment of unexpected laughter, the tangible presence of community - shone brighter against the acknowledged darkness.

This offers a profound challenge to the second mutation of MAGA Christianism - "practical atheism" - which replaces Jesus as moral exemplar with pragmatic power politics. Jesus himself modeled lament in Gethsemane and on the cross. His politics wasn't one of power-through-strength but vulnerability-through-presence.

## Practices of Lament

Faithful lament isn't just theological concept but embodied practice. Consider incorporating these practices into your spiritual life:

- **Pray the psalms of lament** - Make Psalms 13, 22, 42, 88, and others regular parts of your prayer life
- **Create spaces of communal grief** - Hold services specifically for expressing collective sorrow over injustice, tragedy, or loss
- **Practice truthful storytelling** - Name painful realities in your community, family history, or national past
- **Develop rituals of remembrance** - Create regular ways to honor losses, whether personal or communal
- **Engage in prophetic actions** - Transform grief into concrete acts of solidarity with those who suffer
- **Study historical trauma** - Learn about histories of suffering often minimized in dominant narratives
- **Write prayers of lament** - Create your own expressions of faithful grief addressing current realities

These practices form us as people capable of both acknowledging wounds and imagining healing, of naming brokenness while maintaining hope.

## A Call to Faithful Grief

As followers of Jesus in this historical moment, we are called to the discipline of faithful grief. This means:

- Refusing both naïve optimism and cynical despair
- Creating space in our communities for honest expression of pain
- Naming injustice clearly without rushing to facile solutions
- Acknowledging our own complicity in systems of harm
- Holding space for those whose suffering defies easy explanation

This faithful grief doesn't contradict hope; it grounds it in reality. It doesn't undermine action; it ensures our action addresses actual needs rather than imagined scenarios. It doesn't weaken community; it strengthens it through authentic connection.

Like the ancient practice of sitting shiva in Jewish tradition, Christian lament creates space to simply be present with suffering before moving to action. It acknowledges that some wounds require time and presence before they can heal.

In a culture hungry for quick fixes and simple narratives, the discipline of lament offers a revolutionary alternative - one that honors complexity, embraces vulnerability, and creates space for genuine transformation. Through faithful grief, we discover not just survival but the possibility of resurrection - in our personal lives, our communities, and perhaps even our nation.
