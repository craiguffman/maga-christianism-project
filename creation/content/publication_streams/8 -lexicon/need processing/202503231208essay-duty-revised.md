# Duty: Beyond Blind Obedience

Hope isn't merely a feeling but a commitment that calls us to action. This brings us to our next exploration: duty—the covenant obligations that flow from theological hope and bind us to one another beyond mere self-interest.

On January 6, 2021, I watched as some who claimed to be acting out of patriotic duty stormed the Capitol. Many invoked God's name, claiming divine mandate for their actions. Meanwhile, police officers like Officer Eugene Goodman fulfilled their duty in a profoundly different way—protecting those who might well have voted differently than he did, upholding his oath rather than personal preference.

These contrasting visions of duty illuminate a critical distinction: between duty as blind obedience to authority and duty as faithful covenant. This distinction matters deeply in our current moment, where appeals to duty often mask mere compliance with partisan demands or abdication of moral responsibility.

## The Distortion of Duty

"I was just following orders." This notorious justification rings hollow across history, from Nuremberg to Mai Lai to Abu Ghraib. Yet it persists as a temptation—the reduction of duty to mere obedience, the comfortable surrender of moral agency to authority figures.

[LEXICON: MAGA Christianism] frequently weaponizes duty in precisely this way. When officials refuse to certify election results despite legal obligation, when religious leaders rationalize immoral behavior from political allies, when followers embrace disinformation because it comes from trusted sources—duty becomes distorted into something God never intended.

True duty cannot exist without moral discernment. This is why the Uniform Code of Military Justice explicitly requires military personnel to obey only lawful orders. Even in contexts we associate with strict hierarchy, duty is never blind obedience but covenant relationship guided by higher principles.

The prophet Micah understood this distinction clearly. When confronting distorted religiosity, he didn't advocate abandoning duty to God but redefined it: "What does the Lord require of you? To do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God." Duty here isn't ritualistic compliance but covenant relationship characterized by justice, mercy, and humility.

## Duty as Covenant

The Hebrew word often translated as "duty" carries connotations not of blind obedience but of sacred trust. The mitzvot in Jewish tradition aren't arbitrary commands but the terms of covenant relationship—how God's people live out their identity as partners in redemptive work.

This understanding transforms duty from burden to privilege, from external imposition to internal calling. Consider Abraham's response to God's call. His obedience wasn't mechanical compliance but relational trust, entering a covenant whose full implications he couldn't possibly comprehend.

Jesus extended this covenantal understanding when he told his disciples, "I no longer call you servants... Instead, I have called you friends." The relationship had matured from master-servant to friendship—not eliminating duty but transforming it into mutual commitment.

When I was commissioned as a naval officer, I swore an oath not to a person but to the Constitution—not to blindly follow orders but to "support and defend" principles that transcend any individual. This oath remains binding precisely because it represents covenant commitment to values larger than self-interest or partisan advantage.

## The Three Dimensions of Authentic Duty

True duty operates in three dimensions that require our constant attention:

**First, duty to truth.** Without commitment to reality as it is, not as we wish it to be, duty becomes dangerously untethered. This is why bearing false witness violates not just the ninth commandment but undermines the very possibility of covenant community. When we embrace convenient falsehoods because they serve our preferred narrative, we've already abandoned authentic duty.

My own journey from libertarian individualism to a more relational understanding of [LEXICON: Freedom as Capacity to Love] required painfully acknowledging truths about my family's history in Louisiana and my own complicity in systems of privilege. This duty to truth precedes all other duties because without it, we cannot know what true faithfulness requires.

**Second, duty to others.** The covenant community always extends beyond our immediate circle to include those easily overlooked. The Torah repeatedly emphasizes duty to "the widow, the orphan, and the stranger"—those without social power. Jesus extended this further, commanding love even for enemies.

When duty becomes exclusive—concerned only with obligations to our own tribe, nation, or ideological allies—it ceases being genuine duty and becomes mere group loyalty. True duty recognizes the image of God in every person, creating obligations that transcend political divides.

**Third, duty to principles.** Authentic duty requires commitment to values that transcend immediate circumstances or advantages. For Christians, these principles emerge from the character of God revealed in Christ—self-giving love, preferential concern for the vulnerable, reconciliation across dividing walls of hostility.

These principles provide the necessary corrective when authorities demand actions contrary to God's character. As Peter and John declared when ordered to stop preaching, "We must obey God rather than human beings." Their duty to divine principles transcended even legitimate religious authority.

## Duty in Military Context

My Naval Academy experience provides insight into duty properly understood. The Academy's emphasis on honor, courage, and commitment recognizes that military effectiveness depends not on blind obedience but on moral integrity guided by higher principles.

Military history celebrates not those who mechanically followed orders but those whose commitment to deeper principles led them sometimes to disobey immoral commands. Hugh Thompson Jr., who intervened during the My Lai massacre by landing his helicopter between American soldiers and Vietnamese civilians, exemplifies this understanding of duty.

The military oath's commitment to "support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic" creates space for moral discernment. When I took that oath, I wasn't surrendering moral agency but committing to principles that would guide my exercise of it.

## Practicing Duty in an Authoritarian Age

How do we reclaim authentic duty in an age of increasing authoritarianism? Four practices seem essential:

**First, cultivate contemplative distance.** Duty requires space between stimulus and response, between command and action. Regular practices of silence, prayer, and reflection create room for discernment rather than reaction. The Jesuit practice of Examen offers a model for examining our actions against deeper commitments.

**Second, commit to covenantal communities.** Authentic duty flourishes in communities bound by mutual commitment rather than hierarchical control. Whether faith communities, civic organizations, or friendship networks, these spaces allow us to practice the give-and-take of covenant relationship.

**Third, clarify ultimate loyalties.** Jesus warned that we cannot serve two masters. When political loyalty trumps commitment to truth or concern for the vulnerable, we've fallen into idolatry. Regular examination of where our deepest commitments lie helps prevent this distortion.

**Fourth, embrace the cost of authentic duty.** Covenant faithfulness often carries a price—the loss of status, security, or belonging. Jesus didn't promise his followers comfort but a cross. Authentic duty requires willingness to bear this cost rather than compromising deeper principles for temporary advantage.

## From Duty to Honor

True duty leads naturally to [LEXICON: Honor]—the integrity that flows from faithful covenant relationship. As we reclaim duty as sacred trust rather than blind obedience, we rediscover what the Psalmist meant when he wrote, "I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."

The alternative to authoritarian demands isn't autonomous individualism but covenant commitment—relationships bound by mutual obligation guided by transcendent principles. This understanding of duty offers a powerful counter-witness to both the blind obedience demanded by authoritarianism and the radical autonomy promised by secular liberalism.

As we face increasing pressure to surrender moral agency to authority figures—political, religious, or cultural—the recovery of duty as covenant becomes not just personally important but politically essential. Our democracy depends not on citizens who blindly follow but on those who understand their higher duty to truth, to others, and to principles that transcend partisan advantage.

This isn't duty as burden but as blessing—the privilege of participating in a covenant relationship that transforms not just individuals but communities and nations. As we explore next the virtue of honor, we'll see how this understanding of duty creates the foundation for integrity in both personal character and public life.
