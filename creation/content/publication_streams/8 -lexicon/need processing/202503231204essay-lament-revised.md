# Lament: Faithful Grief as Resistance

Having explored how [LEXICON: Justice] emerges at the intersection of love, power, and mercy, we must now confront what happens when justice seems absent or delayed. This brings us to the essential spiritual practice of [LEXICON: Biblical Lament] - a form of faithful grief that serves as its own kind of resistance.

When I watched cancer spread through my beloved Claudia's body, I learned something about grief that our political moment desperately needs. As the disease progressed, we faced a choice: deny reality with false positivity, or embrace the brutal truth as the only path toward whatever healing remained possible. There was a strange grace in accepting what was happening — not with resignation, but with clear-eyed recognition that allowed us to be fully present to each moment that remained.

I find myself thinking of this experience as I witness the spiritual malignancy spreading through our national body. [LEXICON: MAGA Christianism], with its triumphalist certainty and aversion to acknowledging brokenness, resembles nothing so much as that impulse to deny a devastating diagnosis. We don't want to believe that what ails us has metastasized so deeply, and so we reach for comforting lies rather than the hard medicine of truth-telling.

## The Lost Practice of Lament

America has lost the capacity for collective grief. Our culture rushes toward manufactured happiness, treats sadness as pathology, and interprets any acknowledgment of brokenness as "talking down America." We have no grammar for sitting with pain, no rituals for communal mourning, no patience for the necessary work of lament.

This aversion to lament finds particular expression in the movement currently claiming to represent Christian values in the public square. MAGA Christianity has abandoned the biblical practice of lament in favor of triumphalism. It offers a faith without Good Friday, a resurrection without the cross, a victory without vulnerability. It cannot weep with those who weep because it refuses to recognize wounds that don't serve its narrative.

Yet Scripture tells a different story. Approximately one-third of the Psalter consists of laments. The book of Lamentations stands as an extended exploration of communal grief. Jesus himself wept before the tomb of Lazarus and over the city of Jerusalem. The Bible demonstrates that faithful lament is not a failure of faith but an expression of it.

## Great Is Thy Faithfulness

From the depths of national devastation came what we now know as one of Christianity's most beloved hymns. The words of "Great Is Thy Faithfulness" emerge from Lamentations 3:22-23, appearing just after the writer has cataloged unimaginable suffering. The hope expressed isn't cheap optimism that denies reality, but rather a hard-won trust forged in the crucible of honest grief.

The hymn's journey from devastation to fidelity offers a framework for our own time: we must first name and face our losses before we can authentically claim God's faithfulness. The pattern is clear throughout Scripture: honest assessment precedes genuine renewal.

Consider Psalm 51, where David moves from brutal honesty about his sin toward the possibility of restoration: "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." This movement from contrition to renewal requires passing through, not around, the valley of honest self-examination.

## Lament as Faithful Remembrance

At its heart, lament is a form of faithful remembrance. It is our refusal to forget our God-given identity even amid destruction. When Jerusalem lay in ruins, the authors of Lamentations did not abandon their understanding of themselves as God's covenant people. Instead, they held this identity in tension with their present reality, creating a space where both truth and hope could coexist.

This practice of remembering who we are even when all evidence suggests otherwise allows us to continue the journey toward the New Jerusalem despite present devastation. It requires acknowledging our own responsibility for what has been destroyed while refusing to believe that destruction is the final word.

## Cancer and Country: Metastatic Spirituality

The parallels between physical and spiritual malignancy are striking. Both require honest diagnosis before healing can begin. Both tempt us toward denial until the disease has spread beyond containment. Both demand costly interventions that cannot guarantee outcomes.

What I learned at Claudia's bedside applies equally to our national sickbed: false positivity is not kindness but evasion. Only by naming the reality of our condition can we find the strength to face whatever comes next. The road to healing, whether physical or spiritual, begins with the courage to look unflinchingly at what ails us.

## The Politics of Lament

Authentic grief fundamentally challenges the "greatness" narrative that dominates our current political discourse. It acknowledges injustice as a prerequisite for healing. It resists the premature reconciliation that papers over wounds without cleaning them.

The prophetic tradition consistently names what has been lost or betrayed before offering hope. Isaiah does not minimize Israel's unfaithfulness before proclaiming God's redemption. Jeremiah weeps before offering restoration. This pattern serves as a rebuke to political theologies that skip directly to triumphalism without passing through the valley of honest assessment.

In an age where shamelessness has become a political virtue, contrition itself becomes a radical act. To kneel in genuine sorrow over what we have done and left undone represents a counter-cultural witness to a different set of values than those currently ascendant.

## Practicing Lament in Community

How might we recover this lost practice? We need rituals that make space for grief — moments of silence, liturgies of lament, ceremonies of remembrance. We need "truth-telling zones" where pain can be acknowledged without immediate solutions being offered. We need faith communities willing to sit in ashes before reaching for crowns.

The movement from individual to collective lament is especially crucial. My personal grief over my nation's spiritual condition must join with others' grief to become a chorus that cannot be ignored. The "I" must become "we" if lament is to have political significance.

## From Lament to Hope

Authentic [LEXICON: Hope as Virtue] emerges not despite lament but through it. By refusing both despair and cheap optimism, lament creates conditions where genuine hope becomes possible. The pattern in Lamentations itself demonstrates this movement: devastating honesty creates space for remembrance, which in turn opens possibility.

Jesus understood this when he pronounced blessing on those who mourn (Matthew 5:4), promising they would be comforted. The comfort comes not by avoiding grief but by moving through it. The beatitude implies a sequence: mourning precedes comfort; it is not replaced by it.

## The Faithful Witness of Tears

In our current moment, where authoritarian impulses demand displays of strength and optimism, tears themselves become acts of resistance. To weep is to reject the politics of invulnerability. To lament is to insist that pain matters, that losses should be counted, that the vulnerable are worth protecting.

As we move from lament toward community, we carry this wisdom: only by naming what is broken can we begin to imagine its repair. Only by acknowledging death can we perceive resurrection. Only by embracing grief can we find our way to authentic joy.

The cancer in our national soul will not be cured through denial. The path forward requires the same unflinching honesty I learned at my beloved's bedside — the courage to see what is, even as we hope for what might yet be.

## Toward Resilient Community

Lament, while often experienced individually, ultimately calls us toward community. Only together can we transform personal grief into collective action. This brings us to our next exploration: how authentic [LEXICON: Community] serves as a bulwark against the isolation that breeds despair. For it is in community that our laments find resonance and our hopes find reinforcement, creating resilience that can withstand even the most challenging times.
