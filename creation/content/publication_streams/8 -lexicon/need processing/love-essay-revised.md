# Love (Part 2): Participation as Freedom's Fulfillment

In these uncertain days of political turmoil, I've noticed something powerful in the eyes of those who come to my office for counsel. Behind the angry political rhetoric, the passionate opinions, and the righteous indignation lies something more fundamental: fear. Whether expressed as anxiety about America's future, worry over cultural change, or concern about personal safety, fear has become the emotional undercurrent of our political moment.

This observation brings us back to a profound truth from 1 John 4:19: "We love because he first loved us." Just a few verses earlier, John writes, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear." Here we discover something vital about the relationship between love and fear—they are not simply emotions but opposing orientations toward participation in life itself. Fear is not merely the absence of love; it is its antithesis, its contradiction. Fear prevents the very participation that makes freedom possible, while love creates the conditions for that participation to flourish.

## Fear as Barrier to Participation

Fear drives so much of our current dysfunction by preventing genuine participation. Fear of the other leads us to embrace nationalism rather than prophetic patriotism—withdrawing from participation with those deemed different rather than creating spaces where all can belong. Fear of vulnerability makes us cling to distorted notions of honor—maintaining appearance rather than participating in truthful community. Fear of complexity pushes us toward blind obedience rather than covenantal duty—following rules rather than participating in principles that give those rules meaning.

I've witnessed this dynamic in my own journey from libertarian individualism to a more relational understanding of freedom. For years, my workaholism served as elaborate defense mechanism against the vulnerability that genuine participation requires. By filling every moment with productive activity, I avoided both the pain and possibility of authentic presence with others. My supposed freedom from interference actually prevented freedom for participation in relationships that might have transformed me.

As Sam Wells reminds us in "God's Companions," God's response to our fear is not abstract reassurance but incarnate presence—what he calls "being with" us. This presence makes possible a different kind of love, one that isn't just affection or principle, but embodied practice of participation. The good news that "God is with us" makes possible the practices of faith, hope, and love that enable all other virtues.

This understanding of divine presence connects directly to Douglas Campbell's critique of contractual frameworks. Rather than understanding salvation as transactional exchange where Christ pays our debt, Campbell emphasizes participation in Christ's resurrection life. We aren't merely forgiven by Christ but incorporated into Christ, participating in divine reality that transforms how we relate to God, others, and creation.

Aquinas understood this profoundly. In my study of his work during my doctoral research at Durham, I found that he frames the theological virtues—faith, hope, and love—not as abstract qualities but as habits of participation. Faith means participating in divine knowledge, hope means participating in divine promise, and love means participating in divine goodness itself. Most importantly, these virtues aren't achievements we earn but gifts God infuses into us through grace. We become capable of loving not through our own effort but through participation in divine love that transforms us.

## From Fear to Love: A Journey Through Participatory Virtues

Our journey through these twelve essays has traced a path from fear toward love—a path made possible only because God first loved us, creating space for our participation in divine reality. Let's see how each virtue finds its fulfillment in love as participation:

**Truth** emerges not as abstract concept but as relationship. When we confronted bullshit in our first essay, we recognized that truthfulness matters not merely for accuracy but for authentic connection. We love truth because God, who is Truth, first loved us, inviting our participation in reality as it actually is rather than as we wish it to be.

In my own journey, truth-telling has often required painful acknowledgment of my family's history in Louisiana—confronting the reality of ancestors who owned enslaved people, who defended white supremacy, who benefited from systems of oppression. This truthfulness isn't self-flagellation but necessary participation in reality that makes genuine love possible.

**Empathy** draws us beyond our own perspective into participation in the experience of others. This capacity isn't mere technique but sharing in God's compassionate gaze. We become capable of empathy because God first empathized with us, entering fully into our human experience through incarnation.

Through my parish's refugee resettlement ministry, I've discovered how empathy forms through concrete practices of accompaniment—driving families to doctor appointments, helping navigate school enrollment, cooking meals together. These aren't merely helpful activities but participation in shared life that transforms both parties.

**Freedom**, as we've explored, isn't absence of constraint but capacity to participate in communities without domination. We become truly free not by escaping obligations but by embracing the liberating bond of love—a bond made possible because God freely chose to love us first, creating space for our participation without controlling or manipulating our response.

My naval service taught me this paradoxical truth: Only by accepting the constraints of covenant commitment—to shipmates, to Constitution, to country—did I discover genuine freedom. Not freedom from obligation but freedom for participation in something greater than myself. Not absence of limits but presence of purpose that gave those limits meaning.

**Justice** finds its truest expression not in retribution but in the intersection of love, power, and mercy that creates conditions for mutual flourishing. We pursue justice not from self-righteousness but because we have first experienced God's justice tempered with mercy—what Campbell calls God's "deliverance" rather than punishment.

As a priest in northern Virginia, I've participated in community organizing efforts that understand justice not as punishment of wrongdoers but as creation of conditions where all can participate in community without domination—addressing affordable housing, mental health services, and racial equity not as separate issues but as connected aspects of participatory justice.

**Lament** allows us to face suffering honestly without surrendering to despair. We can engage in faithful grief because we know God's love endures even through our darkest valleys—that our participation in grief doesn't separate us from divine presence but paradoxically connects us more deeply to God who suffers with us.

During my wife's cancer treatment, I discovered that honest grief—refusing easy answers or spiritual platitudes—actually deepened our participation in both human community and divine presence. Friends who sat with us in silence, who listened without trying to fix, who cooked meals and walked dogs, demonstrated how lament serves not as withdrawal from participation but as different mode of shared presence.

**Community** forms us into something greater than isolated individuals. We risk the vulnerability of authentic connection because God first risked vulnerability by entering into communion with us—creating space for our participation in divine life without overwhelming or controlling us.

My participation in the Episcopal Church has taught me that genuine community emerges not through agreement about everything but through practices that help us navigate disagreement without domination. Common prayer, shared Eucharist, mutual service—these create space where differences don't disappear but transform from threats into occasions for deeper understanding.

**Hope** sustains us as virtue rather than mere feeling. We practice hope as commitment to future good because God's love gives us confidence that history bends ultimately toward redemption—that our participation in present struggle connects to God's ongoing work of reconciliation.

As a seminary professor, I've witnessed how theological education can form students in participatory hope that sustains them through pastoral challenges. Not optimistic denial of problems but realistic engagement with difficulties grounded in confidence that God remains present and active even when results aren't immediately visible.

**Duty** binds us in covenant relationship rather than blind obedience. We fulfill obligations to truth and others because we have first experienced God's faithful commitment to us—a commitment that makes our participation possible without demanding robotic compliance.

During my corporate career, I learned that genuine duty emerges not from external rules but from participation in shared purpose that gives those rules meaning. When organizations cultivate this participatory understanding, employees move beyond mere compliance to creative engagement with organizational mission.

**Honor** maintains integrity in an age of corruption. We develop this inner wholeness because God's love provides the secure foundation that makes consistency possible—liberating us from fragmentation into the integrated personhood that enables full participation.

In naval leadership, I discovered that honor flourishes not primarily through individual willpower but through participation in communities that practice truthfulness together. The Midshipman Honor Concept—"A midshipman does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do"—acknowledges that honor requires communal rather than merely individual commitment.

**Country** calls us to prophetic patriotism rather than idolatrous nationalism. We love our nation while holding it accountable because God's prior love transcends national boundaries while affirming particular places—inviting our participation in both specific communities and universal human family.

My journey from uncritical acceptance of American exceptionalism to more nuanced prophetic patriotism parallels my theological journey from seeing freedom as non-interference to understanding it as participation. Both transformations have taught me how particular loves properly understood don't diminish but enhance universal concern.

All these virtues find their fulfillment in love—not as crowning achievement but as underlying foundation. When John says "we love because he first loved us," he reminds us that our capacity to embody any virtue flows from having first been loved—from participation in divine reality that transforms how we participate in human community.

## Love and Fear in Our Current Moment

In our present political climate, MAGA Christianism offers a vision built fundamentally on fear—fear of cultural change, fear of demographic shifts, fear of losing status, fear of the unfamiliar other. This fear gets baptized as religious conviction, with anxiety about the future reframed as righteous defense of tradition. But as my syntopical analysis has revealed, this movement fundamentally distorts Christian faith through primitive biblicism, practical atheism, and binary apocalypticism—each reflecting withdrawal from participation in the very realities they claim to defend.

The antidote is not better arguments but deeper participation in love. As Aquinas explains, the theological journey begins with God's operative grace moving us to faith and hope, but these virtues remain incomplete until perfected by love. When we truly encounter divine love, our relentless drive for fulfillment finally finds its proper object. Our longing for ultimate truth and goodness no longer attaches to lesser things—like cultural dominance or partisan victory—but to God alone. This reordering of desire then transforms how we engage with everything else through participation rather than possession or control.

This isn't abstract theology but practical reality that I've witnessed in diverse contexts. When we experience ourselves as securely loved, fear's grip loosens. We no longer need to dominate others to feel safe. We no longer require absolute certainty to move forward. We no longer demand that our nation protect us from every threat, real or imagined. Love creates space for the risk that genuine participation requires.

The Louisiana swamps where I spent childhood summers taught me this truth through unexpected means. In murky waters filled with alligators and water moccasins, I learned that fear's instinct is to freeze or flee—to withdraw from participation. But experienced guides showed me how respectful engagement with that environment—moving deliberately, watching carefully, maintaining proper distance—allowed participation without domination or terror. That early lesson in physical participation prepared me for later understanding of spiritual and political participation.

## Virtue Formation as Participation in Anxious Times

What does this mean for virtue formation during this anxious political moment? Three practices of participation seem particularly essential:

**First, practice receiving love.** Before we can love others effectively, we must allow ourselves to be loved—by God and by others. This receptivity runs counter to our self-sufficient culture, yet it forms the necessary foundation for all virtue. Regular practices of prayer, worship, and honest communion with others open us to experiencing love we haven't earned.

In my own spiritual practice, centering prayer has proven transformative precisely because it shifts focus from doing to receiving—creating space where I can experience myself as loved rather than valuable primarily for what I produce. This receptivity doesn't diminish agency but grounds it in the security that makes genuine participation possible without desperate striving for worth.

**Second, reframe political engagement through participatory love rather than fear.** This doesn't mean abandoning principles or avoiding conflict. Rather, it means approaching political differences with the fundamental question: "What does love require?" When faced with complex issues like immigration, healthcare, or economic policy, we ask not "What protects me from threat?" but "What creates conditions where love can flourish for all?"

Through involvement with faith-based community organizing in Virginia, I've discovered how this reframing transforms political discourse from battle between competing fears to collaborative exploration of how to embody love in public policy. It doesn't guarantee agreement, but it changes the nature of disagreement from tribal warfare to serious moral deliberation grounded in mutual recognition rather than mutual suspicion.

**Third, build communities where love enables fuller participation.** Individual transformation matters, but lasting change requires communities practicing love together. Congregations, veterans' groups, neighborhood associations, and civic organizations can become laboratories where we collectively learn to replace fear with love.

My parish has intentionally created spaces where unlikely allies—conservatives and progressives, recent immigrants and lifelong residents, people of different faith traditions—practice listening across difference. These aren't merely dialogue sessions but communities of practice where participants develop habits of engagement that transform how they participate in other contexts.

These communities must be intentionally diverse, bringing together those who might otherwise remain separated by political division. Only by practicing love across difference can we develop the habits that make democratic life possible. As we've explored throughout this series, virtue formation happens not through abstract principles but through concrete practices in specific communities—what Campbell describes as "mimetic formation" where we learn by participation rather than mere instruction.

## Love as Eschatological Participation

In his profound work, Aquinas articulates how hope has both a present and future dimension. We hope for eternal blessedness (the future dimension), but this hope shapes our present through the habits it forms. Similarly, love has both present and future dimensions—we practice love now, however imperfectly, while trusting that love ultimately represents the eschatological reality toward which all history moves.

The New Jerusalem described in Revelation isn't just future promise but present possibility. When Jesus taught us to pray "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven," he invited us to participate in bringing future love into present reality. This participation happens through the very virtues we've explored together—truthfulness, empathy, freedom, justice, lament, community, hope, duty, honor, and love of country rightly understood.

When we practice these virtues, we don't merely resist current corruption; we anticipate future flourishing through present participation. We become not just critics of what is but witnesses to what might be. This witness matters enormously in our current moment, where fear threatens to overwhelm democratic institutions and distort religious faith.

## From Fear to Participatory Love

The path forward isn't retreat into false security but advance into authentic participation. This love isn't naive about threats—it acknowledges real dangers but refuses to be defined by them. It doesn't deny complexity but embraces the messy, difficult work of creating community across difference. It doesn't promise easy answers but sustains us through challenging questions.

In these turbulent times, when autocratic tendencies gain strength and democratic norms erode, the most powerful testimony Christians can offer isn't partisan alignment but incarnate love—love that casts out fear by creating space for fuller participation, love that enables truth by making vulnerability possible, love that empowers freedom by preventing domination, love that pursues justice by recognizing the image of God in every person, love that enables honest lament by providing secure foundation for grief, love that builds authentic community by transcending tribal division, love that sustains genuine hope by connecting present struggle to future promise, love that fulfills covenant duty through relationship rather than mere rule-following, love that maintains integrity of honor through truthful presence rather than false performance, love that enables prophetic patriotism by holding particular affection accountable to universal principles.

This love becomes possible not through our own effort but through participation in God's prior love for us. "We love because he first loved us." This simple truth contains the seed of all virtue formation. The more we experience ourselves as securely loved, the less we need fear to organize our lives. And as fear's grip loosens, we become capable of embodying the very virtues our democratic life requires through participation in communities without domination.

So in this challenging moment, let us return to love—not as sentimental feeling but as concrete practice of participation. Let us build communities where love casts out fear by creating space for genuine encounter. Let us engage political differences with curiosity rather than condemnation. Let us treat opponents with dignity rather than contempt. Let us pursue justice tempered with mercy. Let us speak truth with humility. Let us maintain hope even when evidence suggests despair.

In doing so, we participate not just in preserving democracy but in manifesting the kingdom of God—a kingdom defined not by power as domination but by love as participation. For in the end, as Paul reminds us, "faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love." Not because love supersedes faith and hope, but because love creates the very conditions that make both faith and hope possible—the participatory reality in which we discover our truest freedom not from one another but for and with one another in communities shaped by love without domination.
