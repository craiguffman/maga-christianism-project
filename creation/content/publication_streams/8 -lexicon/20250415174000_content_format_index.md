## Substack Formatting Standards

This section provides comprehensive guidelines for artifact-based content delivery on Substack, including formatting conventions, URL patterns, and cross-referencing structures for each content type.

### Artifact-Based Approach Benefits
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized approach ensures visual consistency across all content types
- **Efficient Workflow**: Templates streamline content creation and reduce formatting time
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Artifacts work consistently across Substack, VSCode, and other tools
- **Version Control**: Facilitates tracking changes and maintaining content history
- **Error Reduction**: Standardized approach minimizes formatting errors during publication
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Consistent URL patterns ensure reliable cross-referencing
- **Batch Processing**: Enables efficient creation of multiple content pieces with consistent formatting

### General Formatting Principles

#### Markdown Structure
- **Headers**: Use standard markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) with consistent hierarchy
- **Bold/Italic**: Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis consistently
- **Lists**: Use standard markdown list formatting for bulleted and numbered lists
- **Blockquotes**: Use `>` for quotations with proper attribution
- **Line Spacing**: Include blank lines between paragraphs and sections
- **Section Dividers**: Use `---` for horizontal rules between major sections
- **Link Formatting**: Use standard markdown `[text](URL)` format for all links
- **Image Embedding**: Use `![alt text](image-url)` format for inline images

#### Substack-Specific Considerations
- **Header Images**: Include standardized header image reference at top of each artifact
- **Pull Quotes**: Format using Substack's specific HTML structure for proper rendering
- **Footnotes**: Use Substack-compatible footnote syntax at end of document
- **Comments Section**: Include standardized prompt for comments when appropriate
- **Subscription Call**: Include standardized subscription call to action at end of piece
- **Navigation Links**: Include standardized navigation to related content at bottom of each piece
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all formatting works on mobile devices (shorter paragraphs, appropriate image sizing)
- **Preview Text**: Include carefully crafted preview text for email distribution

### URL Structure and Cross-Referencing

#### URL Patterns by Content Type
- **Monday Dominative**: `dominative-[topic]` (e.g., `dominative-primitive-biblicism`)
- **Monday Providential**: `providential-[topic]` (e.g., `providential-covenant-theology`)
- **Tuesday Personal**: `rooted-[topic]` (e.g., `rooted-metrics-matter`)
- **Wednesday Theological**: `commonlife-[topic]` (e.g., `commonlife-bullshit`)
- **Thursday Historical**: `untold-[topic]` (e.g., `untold-textbook-lied`)
- **Friday Satirical**: `republic-[topic]` (e.g., `republic-library-renovation`)
- **Saturday Practices**: `practices-[topic]` (e.g., `practices-truthfulness`)
- **Saturday Simply Said**: `simply-[topic]` (e.g., `simply-truth`)
- **Sunday Sermon**: `sermon-[passage]` (e.g., `sermon-mark-1-1-15`)
- **Lexicon Entries**: `lexicon-[term]` (e.g., `lexicon-dominative-christianism`)
- **Weekly Themes**: `theme-[week]-[topic]` (e.g., `theme-01-introduction`)

#### Cross-Reference Implementation
- **Inline Lexicon References**: Format as `[*term*](/p/lexicon-term)` (italicized with link)
- **End-of-Article Glossary**: Use standardized HTML format for term definitions with links
- **Related Content Section**: Include standardized section at end of each artifact with related content links
- **Sermon Connections**: Include standardized reference to related sermon content
- **Weekly Theme Reference**: Include subtle reference to weekly theme in each content piece
- **Series Navigation**: Include "Previous" and "Next" links for content in sequential series

![Header Image: Simply Said: [Virtue/Concept]](header-image-url)

# üéØ Simply Said: What is [Virtue/Concept] and How Do We Practice It?

## What is [Virtue/Concept]?

[Opening paragraph using everyday language and relatable examples to introduce the concept. Make this immediately relevant to teenage experience through a question or scenario they would recognize.]

[Second paragraph providing simple definition of the concept, avoiding technical theological language but maintaining theological accuracy. Use analogies and concrete examples.]

[Third paragraph connecting the concept to Jesus's example and teaching. Show how Jesus embodied this virtue/concept in accessible ways.]

## The Two Fake Versions of [Virtue/Concept]

Today, there are two popular but fake versions of [virtue/concept]:

1. **"[Distortion 1 Name]"**: [Description of how this common distortion gets the concept wrong. Use examples relevant to youth experience. Connect to broader cultural patterns when possible.]

2. **"[Distortion 2 Name]"**: [Description of how this alternative distortion also misses the mark. Again, use relevant examples and connect to cultural patterns.]

Both versions miss that real [virtue/concept] [brief explanation of what both distortions miss].

## Practices for [Virtue/Concept]

### 1. **[Practice 1 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing an accessible practice for youth to implement this virtue/concept. Be specific and actionable. Connect to their lived experience.]

### 2. **[Practice 2 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing a second accessible practice. Ensure this is distinct from the first and targets a different aspect of the virtue/concept.]

### 3. **[Practice 3 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing a third accessible practice. Consider making this one applicable to digital/online contexts.]

### 4. **[Practice 4 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing a fourth accessible practice. Consider making this one relationship-focused.]

### 5. **[Practice 5 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing a fifth accessible practice. Consider making this one community or group-oriented.]

### 6. **[Practice 6 Name]**
[1-2 sentences describing a sixth accessible practice. Consider making this one a reflective or contemplative practice adapted for youth.]

## Why This Matters

[First paragraph connecting this virtue/concept to Jesus's kingdom vision. Show how Jesus offered an alternative to both distortions and why this matters for discipleship.]

[Second paragraph explaining the personal benefits of practicing this virtue/concept. Focus on authentic human flourishing rather than mere moralism.]

[Final paragraph offering encouragement and inspiration. Acknowledge difficulties while emphasizing possibility of growth and transformation.]

## Questions for Reflection

1. [Question focusing on personal experience with this virtue/concept]
2. [Question examining cultural messages about this virtue/concept]
3. [Question exploring obstacles to practicing this virtue/concept]
4. [Question inviting practical application]
