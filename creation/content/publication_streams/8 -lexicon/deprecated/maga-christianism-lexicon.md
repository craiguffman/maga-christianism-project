## Sample Entry: Christianism

![Lexicon Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400/e6f7ff/0066cc?text=Christianism+Lexicon)

### Definition
Christianism refers to the politicization of Christian identity into an ideological movement that systematically deploys religious symbols, language, and identity markers to advance specific political agendas and power structures.

### Etymology
The term "Christianism" has deeper historical roots than commonly recognized, appearing in 19th century religious texts during the same period when scholars like Adolf von Harnack and Ernst Troeltsch pioneered the "history of religions" approach. Its modern usage follows linguistic patterns similar to "Islamism," signifying the transformation of religious identity into political ideology. Andrew Sullivan helped popularize the term in his 2006 Time magazine article "My Problem with Christianism," while academic Rogers Brubaker later integrated it into comparative frameworks of religious nationalism.

### Contemporary Usage
In contemporary discourse, "Christianism" distinguishes politically-motivated religious identity from Christianity as a faith tradition. The term has gained traction in academic circles studying religious nationalism and in political commentary analyzing the religious right. Unlike terms such as "Christian nationalism," "Christianism" specifically highlights the ideological transformation of religious identity rather than merely describing political goals.

### Significance
Understanding Christianism is essential for analyzing how religious identity functions within power structures beyond matters of personal faith. The concept helps illuminate how theological language and Christian symbolism can be repurposed to serve political objectives while maintaining the appearance of religious authenticity. By distinguishing Christianism from Christianity, we can better recognize when religious rhetoric masks political ambitions.

## Sample Entry: MAGA Christianism

![Lexicon Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400/e6f7ff/0066cc?text=Christianism+Lexicon)

> *This is part of the Christianism Lexicon, a collection of key terms and concepts explored in my ongoing work. [View the complete glossary →](#)*

### Definition
MAGA Christianism represents a specific variant of Christianism that fuses traditional Christian nationalist elements with Trumpian populism, creating a religio-political worldview where partisan loyalty becomes inseparable from religious identity.

### Etymology
The term combines "MAGA" (Make America Great Again), Trump's campaign slogan first used in 2016, with "Christianism." While the fusion of Christianity with American exceptionalism has deeper historical roots, MAGA Christianism specifically emerged during the Trump era as evangelical leaders increasingly portrayed Trump as divinely appointed despite his personal divergence from traditional Christian values.

### Contemporary Usage
In current discourse, MAGA Christianism describes the phenomenon where Christian religious expression becomes intertwined with MAGA political identity. The term appears in political analysis, religious studies, and media commentary to distinguish this movement from both traditional evangelicalism and broader Christian nationalism.

### Significance
MAGA Christianism represents a watershed development in American religious politics where political allegiance becomes a test of religious authenticity. Understanding this concept helps explain how religious language gets repurposed to sanctify political figures and positions that might otherwise conflict with traditional Christian ethics.
