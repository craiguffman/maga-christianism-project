## Definition
**MAGA Christianism** refers to a specific variant of Christianism (the politicization of Christian identity) that fuses elements of traditional Christianity with MAGA (Make America Great Again) political ideology. This fusion transforms both religious and political identity, creating a worldview where partisan loyalty becomes inseparable from religious identity and where Christian symbols and language are deployed primarily for political purposes.

## Key Characteristics

### Three Theological Mutations
MAGA Christianism manifests through three primary theological mutations:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning while bypassing historic interpretive traditions, scholarly insights, and theological nuance. This approach enables selective use of biblical texts to support political positions while avoiding texts that challenge those positions.

2. **Practical Atheism**: Though maintaining formal belief in God, functionally removes Jesus as exemplar for moral and political life. This mutation allows approval of political behaviors that directly contradict Christ's example and teachings, effectively treating Jesus as savior but not lord.

3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Divides the world into absolute categories of good and evil, casting political opponents as not merely mistaken but wicked or demonic. This framework transforms political disagreements into cosmic spiritual warfare, justifying extreme measures against perceived enemies.

### Fear-Based Identity
Unlike traditional Christianity, which emphasizes that "perfect love casts out fear" (1 John 4:18), MAGA Christianism operates primarily through fearâ€”fear of cultural change, demographic shifts, status loss, and the unfamiliar other. This fear gets baptized as religious conviction, with anxiety about the future reframed as righteous defense of tradition.

### Fusion of Religious and National Identity
MAGA Christianism portrays America as fundamentally Christian in identity and purpose, conflating loyalty to country with loyalty to God. This fusion:
- Treats certain political positions as essential to authentic Christian faith
- Interprets criticism of American policy or history as attack on Christianity itself
- Sees Christian political dominance as necessary for national flourishing
- Defines authentic American identity in ways that exclude religious minorities

### Pragmatic Relationship to Truth
MAGA Christianism exhibits what philosopher Harry Frankfurt termed "bullshit"â€”indifference to truth rather than deliberate falsehood. This pragmatic approach:
- Values statements primarily for their political utility rather than their accuracy
- Responds to factual challenges by questioning motives rather than addressing evidence
- Appeals to sincerity rather than accuracy when challenged ("he speaks what's in his heart")
- Treats objective reality as malleable according to political necessity

### Selective Historical Narrative
MAGA Christianism promotes a highly selective historical narrative that:
- Emphasizes moments of Christian influence in American history while minimizing religious diversity
- Portrays a golden age of Christian America that must be restored
- Minimizes or denies aspects of American history that contradict the narrative (slavery, indigenous genocide, etc.)
- Treats contemporary cultural changes as unprecedented decline rather than ongoing evolution

## Distinction from Traditional Christianity

MAGA Christianism differs from traditional Christian orthodoxy in several crucial ways:

- **Theological Priority**: Where orthodox Christianity begins with God's self-revelation in Christ and derives political implications from that revelation, MAGA Christianism begins with political goals and retrofits theology to support them.

- **Understanding of Power**: Traditional Christianity emphasizes Christ's model of servant leadership and power through apparent weakness (exemplified in the cross), while MAGA Christianism embraces a domination model of power closer to imperial Rome than to Jesus.

- **Treatment of Enemies**: Jesus commanded love of enemies and prayer for persecutors, while MAGA Christianism frequently demonizes opponents and justifies harsh treatment of perceived enemies.

- **Approach to Truth**: Historic Christianity values truthfulness as reflecting God's character, while MAGA Christianism often exhibits pragmatic indifference to factual accuracy when it conflicts with preferred narratives.

- **Communal Vision**: Traditional Christianity emphasizes the church as alternative community transcending ethnic, national, and cultural divisions, while MAGA Christianism often reinforces such divisions as essential to identity.

## Historical Context

While elements of MAGA Christianism have appeared throughout American history, its current form crystallized during the Trump era, when evangelical leaders increasingly portrayed Trump as divinely appointed despite his personal divergence from traditional Christian values.

This legitimation often employed "Cyrus theology"â€”comparing Trump to the Persian king Cyrus who, despite being a non-believer, was used by God to restore the Israelites according to biblical accounts. This theological innovation
