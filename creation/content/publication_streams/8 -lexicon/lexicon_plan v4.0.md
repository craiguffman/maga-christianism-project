# Updated Lexicon Plan v4.0

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing and implementing the lexicon system to support the expanded MAGA Christianism and Providential Identitarianism project. The lexicon serves as a crucial reference system for defining theological concepts, mutations, and alternatives, ensuring consistent terminology across all content streams.

## Purpose and Function

The lexicon serves several critical functions within the project:

1. **Definitional Clarity**: Providing clear, precise definitions of key terms
2. **Conceptual Framework**: Establishing the theological framework for analysis
3. **Educational Resource**: Serving as educational resource for readers
4. **Reference System**: Creating consistent terminology across all content
5. **Integration Support**: Supporting sermon integration with publication streams
6. **Theological Contrast**: Highlighting differences between orthodox and mutated theology

## Lexicon Implementation Structure

### Publication Framework
The lexicon is implemented on Substack using the following structure:

1. **Main Glossary Page**:
   - Published as a Substack Page added to main navigation
   - Contains categorical and alphabetical organization of all terms
   - Provides central access point to all lexicon entries
   - Updated whenever new entries are added

2. **Individual Entries**:
   - Published as Substack Posts in dedicated "Lexicon" section
   - Hidden from Home feed to maintain feed integrity
   - Consistent URL structure: `lexicon-[term]` (e.g., "lexicon-christianism")
   - Consistent HTML structure and styling

3. **Content Integration**:
   - Inline references in articles (italicized links on first mention)
   - End-of-article glossaries for technical terms
   - Cross-references between related entries
   - Consistent visual styling for lexicon references

### HTML Structure
Each lexicon entry follows a consistent HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Lexicon: [Term]</title>
    <style>
        /* Consistent styling rules */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="header-banner">
        <h1 class="title">Lexicon: [Term]</h1>
        <p class="metadata">üìò Definition series ‚Ä¢ [Date]</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <h2>[Additional Sections Based on Entry Type]</h2>

            <!-- Additional related terms -->
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p class="footer">This lexicon entry was last updated on [Date]</p>
    
    <div class="navigation">
