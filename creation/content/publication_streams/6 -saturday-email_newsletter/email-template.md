**Subject:** Request for Foreword: "Common Life Politics" - Tending the Soil of Democracy

Dear [Recipient Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to share a manuscript that represents the culmination of several years of theological reflection on the virtues essential for democratic flourishing in our current political landscape.

**"Common Life Politics: Tending the Soil of Democracy: Theological Virtues for a Fractured Republic"** explores twelve theological virtues—from truthfulness and empathy to justice and love—that provide resources for faithful witness and civic renewal. Using gardening metaphors and drawing on my experience in military service, parish ministry, and academic theology, these essays suggest ways we might nurture our common life across deep divides.

Given your extraordinary work on [personalized reference to recipient's work relevant to the manuscript], I would be deeply honored if you would consider contributing either a foreword (500-800 words) or a brief testimonial (100-150 words) for this collection. Your perspective would lend significant weight to these reflections.

The attached manuscript represents the core content in a format suitable for review. The final publication will include comprehensive footnotes acknowledging all scholarly influences.

The manuscript is being considered by [Publisher] with a target publication date of early 2025. If you're willing to contribute, I would greatly appreciate receiving your foreword or testimonial by October 2024.

I recognize the significant demands on your time and would be grateful for any contribution you might offer. If you have questions or would like to discuss further, please don't hesitate to contact me directly at [phone number] or [email address].

With sincere appreciation for your consideration,

The Rev. Dr. Craig Geevarghese-Uffman
