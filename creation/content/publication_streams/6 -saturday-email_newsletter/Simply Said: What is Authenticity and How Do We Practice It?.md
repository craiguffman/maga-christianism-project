# Simply Said: What is Authenticity and How Do We Practice It?

## What is Authenticity?

Have you ever felt pressure to be someone you're not? Maybe you've posted things online that make your life seem more exciting than it really is. Or maybe you've stayed quiet about what you actually believe because you're afraid of what others might think.

We all deal with this tension between who we really are and who we think we should be.

Authenticity means being real – but not in the way most people think. True authenticity isn't just "being yourself" or "speaking your truth." It's deeper than that. It's about discovering who you're meant to be in relationship with others.

Here's the weird thing about authenticity: we don't discover who we are by looking inward. We discover who we are through our relationships. Think about it – you're someone's child, someone's friend, maybe someone's teammate or classmate. These relationships don't limit your identity – they help create it.

Jesus showed us what real authenticity looks like. He didn't just "speak his truth" without caring how it affected others. Instead, he was always fully himself while being deeply connected to God and to the people around him. His authenticity came from these relationships, not from ignoring them.

## The Two Fake Versions of Authenticity

Today, there are two popular but fake versions of authenticity:

1. **"Just Be Yourself" Authenticity**: This says your feelings and desires are always right and should never be questioned. If something feels good to you, it must be authentic. This leads to self-centeredness.

2. **"Conform to the Rules" Authenticity**: This says there's a strict blueprint for being a "real" Christian, American, man, woman, etc. If you don't match the blueprint, you're not authentic. This leads to rigid performances.

Both versions miss that real authenticity emerges through relationships, not in isolation or through strict conformity.

## Practices for Authentic Relationship

### 1. **Practice Vulnerable Honesty**
Being authentic means being honest about your struggles, not just your successes. Try telling a trusted friend about something you're struggling with. Not for attention, but to practice being real. Notice how sharing creates deeper connection.

### 2. **Listen Without Planning Your Response**
Next time someone's talking, focus completely on understanding them rather than thinking about what you'll say next. Authentic relationships require really hearing others, not just waiting for your turn to speak.

### 3. **Pause Before Posting**
Before sharing something online, ask: "Am I posting this to create a false impression?" Be especially careful with posts that make your life look perfect or that are designed to make others envious.

### 4. **Notice Your Masks**
We all wear different masks in different situations. Some of this is normal and necessary. But notice when you're playing a role so completely that you lose touch with your true self. Ask: "Who am I pretending to be right now, and why?"

### 5. **Create Screen-Free Spaces**
Screens often encourage performance rather than authenticity. Create regular times (meals, before bed) when you're completely screen-free. Notice how being fully present makes authentic connection possible.

### 6. **Practice Confession and Forgiveness**
Regularly admitting mistakes and extending forgiveness creates space for authentic relationship. These practices acknowledge that none of us is perfect, which removes the pressure to pretend.

## Why This Matters

Jesus confronted both the religious leaders who created rigid rules for "authentic" faith and those who wanted to do whatever felt good. He showed us that true authenticity emerges through right relationship with God and others.

When we're authentic, we discover that we're both more flawed and more loved than we imagined. We don't have to pretend to be perfect or to have it all together. Instead, we can be real about our struggles while remaining open to growth.

Real authenticity isn't about finding yourself through self-expression or rule-following. It's about discovering yourself through loving relationships with God and others. It's in these relationships that we become most fully ourselves.

## Questions for Reflection

1. In which relationships do you feel most able to be yourself? What makes those relationships different?
2. What "masks" do you wear in different situations? Which feel necessary and which might be holding you back?
3. When have you felt pressure to present a "perfect" version of yourself? How did it affect you?
4. What's one small practice of authenticity you could start this week?
