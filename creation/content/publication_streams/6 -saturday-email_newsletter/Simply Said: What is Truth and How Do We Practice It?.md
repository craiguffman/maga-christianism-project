# Simply Said: What is Truth and How Do We Practice It?

## What is Truth?

Have you ever played the game "Telephone" where a message gets passed around a circle, becoming more distorted with each person? By the end, the final message often has nothing to do with how it started. That's kind of what's happening in our world with truth.

Truth isn't just about facts, though facts matter. Truth is about seeing reality as it actually is – not just the parts we like or the version that makes us feel good about ourselves.

These days, many people think truth is whatever their group says it is. If you're on Team Red, you believe one set of facts. If you're on Team Blue, you believe another. But truth can't work that way. Reality doesn't change based on which team you're on.

Jesus said something really important about truth: "The truth will set you free." Not "your truth" or "my truth," but "the truth." He wasn't talking about having the right opinions – he was talking about living in right relationship with reality.

The problem is, we all have blind spots. We're all tempted to believe things that make us feel good or that our friends believe. That's why we need practices that help us see beyond our blind spots.

## Practices for Truthfulness

### 1. **Check Multiple Sources**
When you hear something that confirms what you already believe, that's exactly when you should double-check it. Look for information from people who disagree with you. Ask yourself: "What if I'm wrong about this?" This isn't about doubting everything – it's about being honest enough to test your beliefs.

### 2. **Slow Down Your Reactions**
When something makes you immediately angry or excited, take a breath before sharing it. Truth isn't usually discovered in a hurry. Try waiting 24 hours before responding to something that triggers a strong reaction.

### 3. **Look for the Gray Areas**
When someone presents something as totally black and white, that's usually a sign they're oversimplifying. Most important issues have complexity. Practice saying, "This is complicated" instead of jumping to simple conclusions.

### 4. **Practice Confession**
This might sound old-fashioned, but regularly admitting when you're wrong builds the muscle of truthfulness. Start small – admit when you made a mistake or jumped to a conclusion. This is surprisingly hard but incredibly freeing.

### 5. **Find Truthful Communities**
Hang out with people who care more about truth than about winning arguments. Look for friends who will kindly tell you when you're wrong and who can accept correction themselves.

## Why This Matters

When Jesus stood before Pilate, who had the power to execute him, Pilate asked, "What is truth?" It was a dismissive question from someone who thought truth was whatever served his power. 

Jesus showed us something different. Truth isn't about power – it's about reality. And reality is ultimately shaped by love. When we practice truthfulness, we're preparing ourselves to recognize love when we see it, even when it comes in surprising forms.

In a world full of convenient lies, practicing truthfulness is a radical act. It might not always be comfortable, but it leads to genuine freedom – not just having the right opinions, but becoming the kind of person who can recognize reality when you see it.

## Questions for Reflection

1. What makes it hard for you to admit when you're wrong?
2. Can you think of a time when you believed something that later turned out to be false? How did you discover the truth?
3. Do your social media feeds expose you to different perspectives, or just repeat what you already believe?
4. What's one small practice of truthfulness you could start this week?
