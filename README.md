# Dominative Christianism Project
Project Overview
This repository manages an integrated research and publication project examining theological distortions in Dominative Christianism while developing constructive alternatives through Participatory Freedom Theology.

## Core Frameworks
### Seven Theological Mutations
The project identifies seven theological mutations that co-articulate in Dominative Christianism:

1. **Primitive Biblicism**: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
2. **Practical Atheism**: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
3. **Binary Apocalypticism**: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
4. **Disordered Nationalism**: Elevates national identity above theological identity
5. **Prosperity Materialism**: Reframes blessing as material success
6. **Authoritarian Spirituality**: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
7. **Tribal Epistemology**: Creates closed information systems based on identity

### Participatory Freedom Theology
The constructive theological alternative emphasizes:

- **Trinitarian Foundation**: Freedom emerges from participation in divine life rather than autonomy
- **Freedom as Non-Domination**: Freedom as capacity to love rather than absence of constraint
- **Being With**: Incarnational presence rather than doing things "for" others or "to" others
- **Reformed Catholic Synthesis**: Integration of Reformed insights and Catholic sensibilities
- **Democratic Virtue**: Character formation for participation in common life

## Content Streams
The project publishes across multiple streams:

- **Monday**: Dominative Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
- **Tuesday**: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (recovery, health, land stewardship)
- **Wednesday**: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
- **Thursday**: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (American history)
- **Friday**: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)
- **Saturday**: "Weekend Wisdom" (accessible summaries and practical applications reaching our largest audience)

Additionally, we create:

- **Lexicon Entries**: Created ad hoc to support the other content streams
- **Sermon Content**: Mark-based sermon series integrating theological themes

## Content Classification Framework
The project implements a three-class content classification system:

### Class A: Tana-Bound Tools
- **Definition**: Knowledge objects and tools that live primarily in Tana
- **Examples**: Knowledge indices, reference frameworks, tracking systems
- **Format**: Strict tagging conventions with consistent metadata
- **Creation Process**: Artifact-based creation with Claude, imported to Tana

### Class B: Dropbox-Bound References
- **Definition**: Research materials stored in structured Dropbox directories
- **Examples**: Source analyses, draft chapters, research notes
- **Format**: Standard markdown with directory-based organization
- **Creation Process**: Claude artifacts refined in VSCode, stored in Dropbox/GitHub

### Class C: Platform-Optimized Content
- **Definition**: Public-facing content formatted for specific platforms
- **Examples**: Substack posts, EPUB chapters, YouTube scripts
- **Format**: Platform-specific formatting with appropriate styling
- **Creation Process**: Claude artifacts transformed in platform-specific tools

## Integrated Workflow
### Knowledge Management Structure
The project uses a structured knowledge management approach:

- **Knowledge Objects**: Fundamental conceptual units (topics, concepts, frameworks, mental models)
- **Notes**: Processing materials at varying levels of synthesis (atomic, synthesis, permanent)
- **Source Integration**: Analysis of individual research sources
- **Thematic Integration**: Synthesis across multiple sources
- **Creation Objects**: Publication-ready content for specific streams

### Tool Integration
The project integrates across multiple tools:

- **Tana**: Knowledge management for Class A content
- **VSCode**: Primary editor for Class B content and GitHub integration
- **GitHub**: Version control for Class B content
- **Claude**: Content development using artifact-based workflow
- **Scrivener**: Organization of Class C content for EPUB production
- **Descript**: Class C content for audio/video production
- **Substack**: Publication platform for Class C content

### Content Flow
The project implements a consistent content flow:

1. **Research** (Class B): Analyze sources in VSCode/Dropbox
2. **Organization** (Class A): Create knowledge objects in Tana
3. **Integration** (A→B): Synthesize insights into draft content
4. **Optimization** (B→C): Transform content for specific platforms
5. **Publication** (Class C): Publish to appropriate platforms
6. **Archiving** (C→B): Store backups of published content

### Publication Timeline
The project follows a comprehensive 64-week publication plan:

- **Foundation Setting** (Weeks 1-16): Establishing core concepts
- **Development & Integration** (Weeks 17-32): Exploring implications
- **Synthesis & Solutions** (Weeks 33-48): Constructing alternatives
- **Culmination & Call to Action** (Weeks 49-64): Comprehensive vision
