MAGA Christianism Project
Project Overview
This repository manages an integrated research and publication project examining theological distortions in MAGA Christianism while developing constructive alternatives through Participatory Freedom Theology.
Core Frameworks
Seven Theological Mutations
The project identifies seven theological mutations that co-articulate in MAGA Christianism:

Primitive Biblicism: Claims direct, unmediated access to biblical meaning
Practical Atheism: Removes Jesus as exemplar, replacing with pragmatic politics
Binary Apocalypticism: Creates rigid good/evil, friend/enemy distinctions
Disordered Nationalism: Elevates national identity above theological identity
Prosperity Materialism: Reframes blessing as material success
Authoritarian Spirituality: Replaces communal discernment with charismatic leadership
Tribal Epistemology: Creates closed information systems based on identity

Participatory Freedom Theology
The constructive theological alternative emphasizes:

Trinitarian Foundation: Freedom emerges from participation in divine life rather than autonomy
Freedom as Non-Domination: Freedom as capacity to love rather than absence of constraint
Being With: Incarnational presence rather than doing things "for" others or "to" others
Reformed Catholic Synthesis: Integration of Reformed insights and Catholic sensibilities
Democratic Virtue: Character formation for participation in common life

Content Streams
The project publishes across multiple streams:

Monday: MAGA Christianism Book Chapters (theological analysis)
Tuesday: "Rooted & Reaching" Personal Essays (recovery, health, land stewardship)
Wednesday: 12-Part Faith Series (theological foundations)
Thursday: "Untold America" Historical Confessionals (American history)
Friday: "Divine Republic" Satirical Pieces (cultural commentary)
Saturday: Weekend Wisdom (practical applications)

Additionally, we create:

Lexicon Entries: Created ad hoc to support the other content streams
Sermon Content: Mark-based sermon series integrating theological themes

Integrated Workflow
Knowledge Management Structure
The project uses a structured knowledge management approach:

Knowledge Objects: Fundamental conceptual units (topics, concepts, frameworks, mental models)
Notes: Processing materials at varying levels of synthesis (atomic, synthesis, permanent)
Source Integration: Analysis of individual research sources
Thematic Integration: Synthesis across multiple sources
Creation Objects: Publication-ready content for specific streams

Tool Integration
The project integrates across multiple tools:

VSCode: Primary text editor and repository management
GitHub: Version control and collaboration
Tana: Knowledge management with custom super tags
Claude: Content development and research analysis
Scrivener: Long-form content organization
Descript: Audio/video content creation

Publication Timeline
The project follows a comprehensive 64-week publication plan:

Foundation Setting (Weeks 1-16): Establishing core concepts
Development & Integration (Weeks 17-32): Exploring implications
Synthesis & Solutions (Weeks 33-48): Constructing alternatives
Culmination & Call to Action (Weeks 49-64): Comprehensive vision
