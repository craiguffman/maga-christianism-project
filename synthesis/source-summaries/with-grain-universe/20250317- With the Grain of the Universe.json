Justification by faith is loosed from its Christological context and made a truth to underwrite a generalized virtue of humility in order to make Christians trusted players in the liberal game of tolerance.

The gospel, the good news Christians have been given, the good news that we believe is embodied in the church, is not \"at home\" in this world.

Yet according to James, the work of science utterly repudiates the personal point of view. Science records it laws and constructs its theories, ignoring their bearing on human fate....\" \n- **Location**: Loc 409\n- [ ] Quoting James in Varieties )4-6-408): \"The God whom science recognizes must be a God of universal laws exclusively, a God who does a wholesale, not a retail business.

As the passage above suggests, James thought that after Darwin it was impossible to think that the world represented an orderly order.

Accordingly, science itself can no longer offer certainty and/or proof but only probable and persuasive explanations.\" \n- **Location**: Loc 426\n- [ ] \"James understood his task in _Varieties_, indeed it was the task of all his work after _The Principles of Psychology_, to do nothing less than to reclaim the human from the impersonality of chance.

Rather, as I noted at the beginning of this lecture, personal religion for James was a \"primordial thing\" and was thus the source of all institutional forms that religion might take. In _The Will to Believe_, James had described religion as a belief in an unseen world. In _The Varieties of Religious Experience_, he elaborates and speaks of the \"added dimension of emotion, this enthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so called can at best but bow its head and acquiesce.

That Christianity might make sense as something else is a possibility that James rejected.

Barth's discovery that the proper subject ject of theology is God went hand and hand with his understanding of the cultural challenge facing Christians. That challenge, which he thought was unavoidably manifest in World War I as well as in the rise of National Socialism in Germany, was nothing less than a recognition that our world has become quite literally godless.

If faith is but the realization of an individual's spiritual life and self-awareness, if faith is but the capacity of the infinite in the finite, then faith as the Christian's tian's commerce with God can finally be no more than the Christian's commerce with herself. As a result, the truth of the gospel can be understood stood as an expression, a predicate, or a symbol of the Christian's inner experience. Barth argued that modern theology had accepted the Renaissance naissance discovery that humans are the measure of all things, which meant that \"there was no effective answer to be given to Feuerbach who eagerly invoked Luther's sanction in support of his theory that statements ments of the Christian faith, like those of all other religions, are in reality ity statements of more or less profound human needs and desires projected jected into the infinite.\" \n- **Location**: Locations 1468-1474\n- [ ] \"Barth never left behind his attack on the Protestant liberal attempt to ground our knowledge of God in experience, but he was able to recover a more adequate account of natural ural theology because the demands of his theological reflection led him in new directions.
