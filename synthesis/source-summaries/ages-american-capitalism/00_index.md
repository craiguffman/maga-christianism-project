Fast-moving money, rapid investment and disinvestment, across various asset classes, as well as in and out of various companies, has not only overturned old methods of production—its logic has often threatened to overwhelm other economic patterns.

New, intangible forms of capital, like “human capital” and the “social capital” that connected Silicon Valley’s recombinant networks of relationships, appreciated. Everywhere, online and off, the “network” became the new organizing principle of business for increasingly multinational U.S. corporations, but also in social life more generally.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=oXutBEmEBxTP)](_the_relationship_between_investment_and_enterprise_changed_often_the_valuation_of_silicon.md) (7 highlights)

- [- [A historically low short-term interest rate from the Fed supported a genuine worldwide economic boom, centered on the rise of China as a world manufacturing power after its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Regions of China became ever more linked to U.S. multinational supply chains, as Chinese producers exported such things as flat-screen televisions and, beginning in 2007, Apple’s iPhone, into the great U.S. consumer market. To help finance U.S. consumption and to accumulate dollar-denominated assets—the world’s safest, most risk-free, liquid investment—China also began to export prodigious amounts of its savings into the U.S. capital market. That helped hold down long-term interest rates as well.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=McBF19IQWARk)](_a_historically_low_short_term_interest_rate_from_the_fed_supported_a_genuine_worldwide_economic.md) (109 highlights)
- [- [Bernanke was correct that in addition to price stability and low inflation, the 2000s expansion shared many qualities with those since 1982. What he did not emphasize was that the pattern of economic development continued to be asset-led and therefore new income gains flowed largely to the best-off, who by now increasingly tended to be highly educated, and lived in those cities where the new economy thrived. In those places where it did not, economic life suffered.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=Ul2UkPTPD7Cw)](_bernanke_was_correct_that_in_addition_to_price_stability_and_low_inflation_the_2000s_expansion.md) (32 highlights)

Bush advocated a new “ownership society.” Arguably, not since Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty had there been a vigorous politics of property ownership in the United States. Ever since late nineteenth-century industrialization, income politics had largely ruled. In the Age of Chaos, income politics fast became anachronistic.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=xJrjf2vv56ji)](_in_2003_president_george_w_bush_advocated_a_new_ownership_society_arguably_not_since_jeffersons.md) (7 highlights)

It was the economic apogee of “family values.” Aided by the low global interest rates of the 2000s and favorable government policies encouraging home ownership, residential real estate prices began to soar nationwide—although, as in Jefferson’s time, white households disproportionately benefited from the surge in wealth.](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=e2cVdqvwrLVo)](_in_the_2000s_however_there_was_a_genuine_attempt_to_fling_open_the_economy_of_asset_price.md) (21 highlights)
