### By the eve of the American Revolution, “the average American colonist ate better, was taller, and lived longer than did the average Englishman” and probably the average person anywhere.  
---

### the insinuation of Locke’s famous discussion of property was that Native Americans did not improve the land and that therefore all of America still lay in common ownership, ripe for dispossession.  
---

### Cotton had to be ginned, removing “trash” from the lint. It was pressed into bales and hauled by slaves to landings and ports. By any criterion, late-antebellum cotton plantations were highly economically productive and efficient. Planters not only extended production across space,…  
---

### Unlike migrating slave owners in the Old Southwest, settlements in the Northwest had to become places where free migrants actually might choose to live before they became wealthy.118 Northwestern migrants quickly built schools, churches, and roads—the entire public infrastructure of civilizational “improvement.” The Great Lakes basin largely voted…

### New York City, foreign-born, largely unskilled industrial workers outnumbered native workers two to one.127 While the Chickerings of the world continued to ascend, the “middle class” of skilled artisanal craft workers…

### An expansion of currency and credit was necessary to sufficiently capitalize genuine black economic freedom.  
---

### In addition to the arts of financial speculation, the post–Civil War railroad corporations invented many of the methods of modern managerial bureaucracy, including accounting techniques, organizational hierarchies, and controlled technological innovation.  
---

### The transcontinentals were built through lands that were occupied by, and often outright belonged to, indigenous nations. At the close of the Civil War, the U.S. government did not control the Great Plains, the territory west of the Missouri River, where approximately…  
---

### Prior to widespread coal use, commercial economies remained rural economies, simply because energy flows were impossible to store or transport. Production necessarily dispersed to where there was waterpower. One reason economic development in the Age of Commerce was spatial was that populations, in order to tap into energy flows, had to move rather than concentrate. With industrialization, however, “specialization growth” across space was supplemented by “power growth” in place.35 Concentrated stocks of energy could be brought to concentrated sites of production.  
---

### The 1913 act licensed national banks to issue farm mortgages, while the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 created twelve federal land banks, with the capitalization of each guaranteed by the Treasury at $750,000. Credit flowed to many farmer-owned cooperatives.101 The new Federal Farm Loan Board was granted powers to regulate private farm lending.102 Without these provisions, which bolstered farmers’ market power and were thus friendly to the Democrats’ agrarian base, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 would likely not have passed Congress, and Wilson would likely not have won reelection in 1916.  
---

### In the Age of Commerce, many Americans had believed that it was politics that determined economic booms and busts. In the Age of Capital, whether it was industrialization, Darwinian evolution, or some other process, the economy seemed to become more autonomous from human agency.  
---

### Among FDR’s widely commented-upon personal qualities was his bottomless reserve of self-confidence and his almost preternatural sense of calm. In contrast to so many nerve-shot capitalists, according to one of his closest advisers, FDR “had no nerves at all.” In the most memorable line of his inaugural address, he declared that Americans had “nothing to fear but fear itself.”  
---

### Going off gold was intended to stoke the reflation of national prices and assert political control over the U.S. economy.142 FDR announced a new policy of “definitely controlled inflation.”143 The price of the dollar, now allowed to float in currency and gold markets, quickly devalued with respect to gold and other currencies  
---

### The subsequent recession of 1973–75 was the worst since the…  
---

### Liberalism was the moniker FDR adopted, in a departure from the classical or “laissez-faire” liberalism of the nineteenth century. Now Republicans became “conservatives.” At a moment when politics, across the globe, newly asserted control over economic life, FDR was the right mass democratic politician. He did not assume dictatorial powers, but it nonetheless was the Age of Control.  
---

### **Tags:** #pink - The way to achieve it was to anchor economic life in the illiquidity of industrial capital, which had the great political advantage of offering male employment. In politics, the most broadly shared expectation of New Deal capitalism was that factories would…  
---

### They all, at some point, had argued that “underconsumption,” not “overproduction,” was the economic problem stunting development. Now they argued that with the 1937 withdrawal of private industrial investment, compensatory government spending—including deficit-financed public investment—must fill the gap.  
---

### Ruml and Henderson estimated that the U.S. national income was $56 billion. That would be a prospective $32 billion, they approximated, short of the economic output necessary to bring employment up to full potential. Citing the concept of a multiplier, when targeting $32 billion, Ruml advocated government expenditure of somewhere between $7 billion and $10 billion in “additional investment or spending, public or private, to get reasonable full employment.” Ruml projected $4 billion in forthcoming private investment. Therefore he recommended to FDR a program of $3 billion in direct public investment—a new kind of jolt to economic development.  
---

### The principle that male pay was the chief currency of distributive justice was by now deeply rooted in the political economy of the Age of Control. In this respect, the war economy did what the New Deal did not do: in creating 11.25 million new jobs, it ended mass male unemployment.  
---

### The fiscal triangle’s institutional structure was the culmination of the U.S. politics of income. It differentiated U.S. political economy from others around the world, where, say, income taxes were less progressive, or where the developmental policies of “mixed economies” activated…  
---

### bad harvests in the Soviet Union and China had led to the exhaustion of government stockpiles of grains. Inventories could not adjust, so prices did. Interacting with speculative expectations in the post–Bretton Woods currency markets, commodity prices surged. Commodity price inflation broke out. The cost of primary inputs increased. Immediately, the U.S. rate of productivity growth was bumped onto a lower track.8 It would never recover.9 Given the immediate shock, economic production declined. In 1973 the United States entered into the deepest recession since the Great Depression—except now in the midst of price inflation, rather than deflation, as was the case in the 1930s.  
---

### U.S. political economy still funneled income and welfare entitlements largely through the white-male-breadwinning wage. Without high rates of male employment and pay, there would be trouble. Average male pay flatlined after 1972. Troublingly, it delinked from the growth, however meager, of productivity, with which it had roughly correlated since World War II. Meanwhile the male workforce participation rate declined steadily.

What he did not emphasize was that the pattern of economic development continued to be asset-led and therefore new income gains flowed largely to the best-off, who by now increasingly tended to be highly educated, and lived in those cities where the new economy thrived.

---

### In the Age of Chaos, productivity growth continued to disappoint, and it remained severed from average compensation growth. The benefits of productivity gains flowed to the best-off; for many working Americans to sustain consumption, debt growth replaced income growth.  
---

### Many of the new jobs created to service the better-off were low paying, and some were exploitative.  
---

### After the Volcker Shock, the total number of U.S. manufacturing jobs had held steady at 17 million. Between 2001 and 2003, however, the United States lost 3 million manufacturing jobs. Exposed to international competition, U.S. manufacturing was one sector where concentration and market power did not increase.44 In addition to facing continued automation, any job was at risk of loss if a low-wage alternative was available overseas. Asia and eastern Europe had hundreds of millions of new wage earners, many newly lifted from economic deprivation even if by other criteria—poor working conditions, breached employment contracts, and unpaid wages—exploitation was rife.  
---

### new macroeconomic expansion began in June 2009. The problem was that the Treasury and the Fed had only put the capitalism of asset price appreciation back together. Economically, the post-2009 expansion would exhibit many of the same qualities as every single one since 1982. Starting from a deeper bottom of unemployment, it was yet another of the era’s jobless recoveries. As asset values climbed, especially stocks, income flowed to the best-off.  
---

### Regardless of the facts, the Tea Party, in common with many populist movements of the American past, was bound together by an emotional logic. “I want my country back,” the feeling went.  
---

### In general, survey opinions about citizen’s ideological beliefs on economic policy matters barely budged.87 Those who economically suffered the most never rounded into a political movement. It was not clear where or how to exert popular pressure on the capitalism of asset price appreciation.  
---

### In American public discourse, there was never an honest discussion about the benefits and the costs of the capitalism sewn back together in 2008, and the economic suffering many ordinary people endured to achieve it, only to benefit from it last and least. Leaders dodged those facts.  
---

### That Trump went further, often making up facts when speaking about economic issues—including his signature issue, trade—must be placed in this context. The stories the financial and political elite told about the economic recovery over the 2010s did not ring true. The political and economic establishment’s characterizations of the post-2008 economic recovery was post-truth politics before Trump.
