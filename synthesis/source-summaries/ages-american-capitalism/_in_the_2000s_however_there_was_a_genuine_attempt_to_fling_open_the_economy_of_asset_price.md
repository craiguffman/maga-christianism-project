## Highlights

### in England a translation of commonwealth principles from religious moralizing into government policy making was well under way. Moral denunciation could do only so much. Good laws backed by the coercive apparatus of the state were necessary to harmonize commerce and commonwealth. In this spirit, mercantilist market regulations, regulating everything from prices and wages to the quality of goods, filled many volumes.35 In this way, the state went about the work of “political economy.”

### To the Democratic-Republicans, it was one page after another pulled from the aristocratic and monarchical British playbook. There would be standing armies, internal taxation, incorporated banks, a national debt, ruling commercial elites, and after the Federalists pushed through the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798, the suppression of political dissent.

### In the Age of Commerce, farm households typically employed commercial safety-first strategies. Farming in the Age of Capital was a different project. West of the Mississippi, prairies gave way to plains. There was no timber on hand for construction, and fewer waterways. Without railroads, there was no market access. The bull-tongued, cast-iron sheathed wooden plow could not break plains sods. Of necessity, more farm inputs and outputs now passed through commercial markets. The farm household’s split gambler-peasant economic personality passed from the scene.

### A dynamic of debt-deflation set in, as the economist Irving Fischer named it in real time, in which distressed sales to raise cash to meet debt payments drove prices down further, only to increase the real value of debts.

### he did break the mass psychology of deflationary future expectations. Going off gold was what economic historians have called a “regime change.” As money devalued, prices began to go up. Consumers began to spend in the present. Rising prices portended rising profits. Investment and its…

### The federal government never attempted deliberate deficit spending in order to aid economic recovery; FDR’s second administration’s attempt to balance the budget contributed to the 1937 recession within the Depression. The cause of the…

### In this context, the most consequential piece of social and economic legislation that Congress passed during the war was the June 1944 GI Bill.99 The legislation guaranteed World War II veterans a range of federal government entitlements, from a year of backstop unemployment insurance to residential mortgage assistance, education subsidies, and business loans. Economic entitlements thus flowed through male citizenship, explicitly defined by the GI Bill as heterosexual citizenship.

### Less money would mean less inflation. Interest rates on credit would then set themselves in the market, free from government intervention. However, as the quantity of money was restricted, the cost of credit—interest rates—would increase accordingly. Short-term interest rates surpassed 19 percent in 1981.

### From the point of view of the worst-off, economic life began to look bleak. Increasingly, incarceration was the solution to the exclusion of people from the postindustrial labor market.109 The “overdevelopment of American penal policy” corresponded to “the underdevelopment of American social policy.”

### Easily, the economy of asset price appreciation moved on from 1990s dot-com corporate stocks to the 2000s residential mortgage market. But 2000s economic life had other qualities. At the time the expert view was that as globalization was irrevocably proceeding, everyone, on net, was gaining.

### income politics were fast becoming anachronistic. Naturally enough, an economy oriented around property asset ownership benefits the rich, since by definition they tend to own most of the property. But there was an option to expand the ranks of ownership—if not through the actual redistribution of assets, then through access to credit, to purchase them. During the 2000s, politicians and financiers alike engaged in a genuine attempt to execute this strategy, through the vehicle of home ownership.

### Geographically, the housing boom exhibited variation. In high-income cities, such as New York and San Francisco, prices soared because real estate markets were tight. In steady urban markets, such as Chicago and Houston, prices rose, but at nowhere near so fast a clip. And in the regions of the born losers, no so-called fundamentals were at work—just the capitalism of leveraged asset price appreciation, dangerously democratized. Many of these regions were among those gutted by globalization and the China trade shock.
