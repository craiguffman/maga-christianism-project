### Wealth is power, and power is wealth. The aphorism commonly attributed to the Englishman Thomas Hobbes, author of the great political philosophical treatise Leviathan  
---

### After the English Civil War, the Restoration English state moved to incorporate its wayward early North American colonies into its expanding imperial, mercantilist orbit. As it did, mercantilism transformed, and American capitalism was born.  
---

### Massachusetts blatantly pursued its own mercantilist policies. The colony encouraged its own manufacturers, regulated its own prices and wages, and minted its own silver coin.72 New England’s commercial economy attempted to duplicate England’s.  
---

### Whether brought about by the Lord or by the invisible hand of the market, both Barbados and New England gained from the trade. Commerce multiplied. West Indian trading credits assisted New England imports of English manufactures. The British Empire’s multilateral Atlantic commercial system of triangular trades began to take shape.  
---

### In 1708, Carolina became the first North American colony to have a black slave majority.105 Echoing the 1661 Barbados slave code, Shaftesbury and Locke’s Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina had declared, “Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves.”  
---

### New England, consisting of the colonies of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, exported foodstuffs, livestock, fish, whale products, and rum. Its merchant class soon thrived in the Atlantic carrying trades, including the slave trade.  
---

### The most consequential principle of English private property for the history of American capitalism was the Enlightenment doctrine of “improvement.” Fittingly for this age, improvement warranted the simultaneous expansion of both British imperial power and private commerce in North America.  
---

### nearly all the North American colonies carved out some form of communal “commons.” Nonetheless, landed property, regardless of its commercial value, continued to earn its owner the cherished civic and political status of “independence.”31 To be under the thumb of no lord. To have no master. To have household dependents of one’s own.

### colonial North America did not evade the feudal past. The Crown granted “proprietary” colonies to Catholic Lord Baltimore

### If we measure economic inequality with respect to household income and wealth, in 1774 the thirteen North American British colonies were economically the most equal society in the world  
---

### For masterless American yeomen, landownership brought independence not only from arbitrary social and political power  
---

### During the revolutionary epoch, contingent political events, not entrepreneurial innovation, most determined the trajectory of economic change.  
---

### Arguably, public debt was the most explosive political issue of the revolutionary era on both sides of the Atlantic. British public debt had led to the 1765 Stamp Act and ultimately the American Revolution. French public debt had led King Louis XVI to convene the Estates-General, leading to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Conceivably, American public debts threatened to undermine the very existence of the young republic.  
---

### Jefferson democratized “Country” republicanism. Not the stolid gentleman farmer but rather the sturdy American yeoman was his ideal republican citizen.  
---

### In the presidential election of 1800, Jefferson—the southern candidate, aided by the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, which increased southern electoral clout by counting slaves as three-fifths of persons for purposes of representation—prevailed.88 Republicans trounced Federalists all the way down the ticket.  
---

### The Treaty of Paris had ceded all British territory south of Canada and east of the Mississippi to the United States. But a number of Britain’s Indian allies did not recognize the cession. West of the Mississippi was Spanish Louisiana, acquired from France after the Seven Years’ War. It extended east across a narrow strip of Gulf coastland to Spanish Florida, which the Spanish used to control access to the great Mississippi port of New Orleans. The Spanish claimed territory east of Louisiana as far north as Tennessee. They sponsored Indian allies, including the Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee nations.

---

### Rather than northeastern foodstuffs shipped to the West Indies, the Old Northwest floated foodstuffs and provisions down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to budding southern cotton plantations. Cotton traveled up the coast.103 With the closing of the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, slaves passed…  
---

### The embargo stimulated internal commerce and manufacturing—the small-scale, household variety, but also more innovative and lasting textile factories and machine shops.112 It was a remarkable shift from the colonial era. Americans now defined themselves not by their old consumer identities as British subjects but by their republican “productive labor.”  
---

### The Americans could not win the war, but neither could Great Britain hold the North American continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. The Treaty of Ghent  
---

### Early National American Colonization, c. 1820 The arrows illustrate the main thrusts of American colonization and settlement in the Old Northwest and Old Southwest. Commercially and politically, the Ohio and Mississippi rivers tied the two regions together.  
---

### In 1838 New York State passed “free banking” legislation. Its advocates called it a “great and admirable improvement on the corrupting political monopoly it superseded.”99 Meeting universal reserve requirements, any citizen of New York State might charter a bank. During the 1840s many states began to pass “general incorporation” laws for banking, manufacturing, and sometimes all enterprise. Some states banned “special” chartering altogether. General incorporation would not triumph until the 1870s. But the trend was now afoot.100 By 1860, eighteen states had passed free banking laws, inaugurating the “free banking era.” Corporate charters proliferated in the tens of thousands, and corporations became uniquely American vehicles of association and enterprise.  
---

### rising slave prices had led to the concentration of holdings and to an increased southern economic income inequality—perhaps one reason why, by the 1840s, income growth in the North was outstripping that of the South.59 Non-slave-owning southern whites became vastly poorer than their northern counterparts. To maintain their political loyalty,…

### The changes cut two ways. U.S. wage earners gained new rights but lost long-term job security as employer obligations thinned out. Southern pro-slavery ideologues, defending paternalism, harped on the latter.  
---

### The southern porch contrasts with the northern parlor. In the North, industrial economic production had left the site of the home, which then acquired new meanings.100 Popular New York architect Andrew Jackson Downing explained in Cottage Residences  
---

### What happened in 1854 was the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The congressional legislation was so inflammatory because, first, it undermined a number of political compromises that the states had already reached over the status of slavery in the western federal territories. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had admitted Missouri as a slave state, but had also barred slavery in the former Louisiana Purchase north of the 36°30' parallel. Then after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ending the Mexican-American War  
---

### Through the cotton trade, ties still bound the “lords of the lash” and the “lords of the loom,” as the antislavery Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner put it in an 1848 speech. New York City’s merchants and financiers had great economic interests in the South.115 But in the trans-Mississippi West, where the sectional struggle over slavery was to play out, commerce could no longer help.  
---

### These shifting commercial patterns reflected a dynamic new Great Lakes thrust of colonization. A midwestern wheat belt had emerged north of the Old Northwest’s corn-and-hog belt. In 1848 the Illinois and Michigan Canal linked the Mississippi River to the young city of Chicago, and by 1860 Illinois enjoyed the honor of being the top wheat-producing state. Northwestern wheat farmers, like southern cotton producers, were exporters. The British Empire’s abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the…  
---

### The Great Lakes thrust of settlement brought “free soil” settlers into the Kansas and Nebraska territories. While oriented toward agricultural exports, the contrast with southern colonization was sharp. Slave capital was portable, which was one reason why it was valuable, but in the Midwest, slave colonization was less rapid than free soil colonization. Slaves were not cheap. Instead, Americans and European immigrants absolutely flooded the Midwest. In 1850 the foreign-born share of the population in the Wisconsin and Minnesota territories was 44 percent.117 The…  
---

### It was no accident that the antislavery Republican Party was founded in the Great Lakes states of Wisconsin and Michigan in 1854, in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Among former Democrats and Whigs, the Republicans quickly earned the loyalties of the Great Lakes wheat basin by supporting a free soil Homestead Act, which southerners in the Senate, hoping to slow down free soil…  
---

### The Know-Nothings charged the Republican Party with being in the grips of radical abolitionists, who cared more about the plight of southern slaves than about the sagging standard of living, if not the “wage slavery,” suffered by northern industrial…  
---

### New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley was the deftest Republican rhetorician, charging the “Slave Power” with seeking to close access not to incorporation but to the western territories for free soil homesteaders. Yet the West was “the great regulator of the relations of Labor and Capital, the safety valve of our industrial social engine.”133 The “Slave Power” was to blame for sagging northern economic conditions. Probably, many northern workers found it easy to blame slaveholders for causing and benefiting from inequality…  
---

### Lincoln believed that while blacks had moral and political rights, the races should not mix socially or, worse, sexually reproduce. He followed Clay in supporting black colonization to Africa.139  
---

### The electoral map for the presidential election of 1860 looked like this: Despite the “lords of the loom,” antislavery New England was Republican. Despite New York City, a Democratic Party stronghold, Republicans could still carry New York State. The Republicans bought off Pennsylvania with Whig-like tariff protection, especially for its ironmongers. The internal improvement hungry Great Lakes wheat belt was solid Republican. For Lincoln to win the White House, the Republican Party had to win enough votes in downstate Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.  
---

### The proletarian migration of some 23.5 million eastern, central, and southern European “new immigrants” augmented the U.S. wage-earning labor force.  
---

### corporations, as philanthropic wealth—not as capital. The outlines of the new political economy of income were on the scene by the 1890s, but they were hardly settled, especially in the western and southern countryside, where issues of property ownership, debt, and deflation continued to predominate. The Panic of 1893 and yet another cyclical downturn led to an agrarian political insurgency.  
---

### Confederate economic mobilization revealed important economic differences between the capitalism of the North and that of the South.39 The CSA had no political parties, but former Democrats ran the Confederate Congress, and early government declarations promised restraints on central government. In the end, the CSA had little choice than to plunder southern economic life.  
---

### to build an internal rail network, but to little effect.42 The southern planter class refused to switch from cotton cultivation to war production. Meanwhile southern planters had informally embargoed foreign cotton sales, hoping Britain would recognize the CSA, but that gambit failed when British cotton manufacturers tapped Indian imports.  
---

### But after the war, the money question came roaring back onto the national political stage.60 It would split the Republican Party, throw the wrench of austerity into political Reconstruction, and both directly and indirectly undermine the black struggle for economic freedom.  
---

### At the basis of sharecropping was the local, political exploitation of black families through debt. Without land, the freedpeople turned to democratic politics.101 The Fifteenth Amendment, enshrining black suffrage rights, was ratified in 1870. In the face of white violence and property rights in the land, however, the ballot was not enough to stop the sharecropping regime from solidifying. Southern white elites did not appear to mind the lack of economic dynamism so much. Having lost political power at the federal level, white supremacy dug in at the local scale. The planter class successfully maintained its rule—racism transformed, now hampering economic development.  
---

### Southern economic institutional failure would persist until the political intervention of the New Deal during the 1930s.104 To their economic detriment, most southern blacks would remain tied to the rural plantation economy during the era of U.S. industrialization, which, unlike industrialization in any other country, would draw its pool of industrial laborers from abroad.  
---

### What was left of the army actively assaulted the economic basis of Indian political and military power. While southern white supremacists committed outrageous atrocities against black citizens, the army followed railroad corporations west into the Missouri Valley. In the winter of 1868, the army conducted devastating raids against Indian winter camps, while the Union Pacific and its southern branch, the Kansas Pacific, bisected the buffalo herds, cutting Plains Indians off from…  
---

### During the course of U.S. industrialization, a political rallying cry—“free labor”—functioned both as a benchmark to assess the worth of economic life and as a plausible ideal worth striving for. In contradistinction to chattel slavery, “free labor,” as it emerged during the Republican mobilization of the 1850s, contained a core principle of aspirational upward mobility—hope.  
---

### The American farm sector was the great agricultural powerhouse of world markets, which were both globalized and highly competitive.  
---

### By now, mass production was clearly the future of industry. The Great Bull Market of the 1920s at the New York Stock Exchange began, and Ford’s chief competitor, General Motors, was among its darlings. The Ford Motor Company was an anomaly. Ford had secured complete control.  
---

### The New Deal’s regulatory arm transformed banking and finance, as well as the conduct of industry and agriculture. The politics of income now blossomed. Multiple programs lifted commodity prices and shored up farm incomes. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided new income security. The Wagner Act, of the same year, legally institutionalized union collective bargaining over pay.

### Consumerism was not new to the postwar era, but its cultural significance and economic implications intensified, as “consumer confidence” and planned obsolescence became…

### FDR relished, in the words of one historian, cobbling together “big-city bosses, the white South, farmers and workers, Jews and Irish Catholics, ethnic minorities, and African Americans” into the lasting electoral bloc behind New Deal liberalism.  
---

### During the 1930s, interest rates remained low, stuck in liquidity-trap territory.15 Interest rates approached zero, and no further reductions were capable of calling forth present spending. Not enough people wanted to part with liquid assets as safe haven stores of value, which meant purchasing power and demand for goods dried up. If government found new ways to make people feel secure…  
---

### Taking office, FDR had no choice but to play confidence games with the American public. “Capitalism,” Moley would say, “was saved in eight days.”  
---

### Finally, in the Second Hundred Days, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, otherwise known as the Wagner Act after its chief legislative sponsor, New York senator Robert F. Wagner.  
---

### In favoring mechanization over agricultural labor, the New Deal also primed southern economic life for the mass black out-migration of World War  
---

### In September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, and the subject of FDR’s fireside chats became war in Europe. U.S. unemployment was still stuck in the double digits, as the New Deal had failed to achieve its great goal of reemploying white male breadwinners. Much more, it left open the question of employing them to do what exactly? Keynes believed increased government expenditure in the right dosage could end the slump  
---

### During 1944, as the outcome of the war looked increasingly secure, planning began for peacetime. Battle lines had already begun to appear in preparation for the great postwar political struggle over the size and purpose of the New Deal state. The final political-economic settlement of the Age of Control, the mix of regulatory and developmental policies, waited for the war to end. But “big government” was here to stay.  
---

### The United States possessed vast internal reserves of necessary raw materials, including critical fossil fuels. During the war, it produced half the world’s coal and two-thirds of its oil.  
---

### It was World War II and not the New Deal that brought about the birth of American “big government.”73 Under the banner of a unitary national public interest, the federal government expanded prodigiously in sheer size and scope.  
---

### “Freedom,” the war’s great ideological rallying cry, must mean not only greater economic security but also abundance for all—including groups, such as women and blacks, excluded from the New Deal’s prime income benefits.  
---

### Congress’s First and Second War Powers Acts of 1941 and 1942 granted the executive a sweeping mandate to intervene in private American economic activity, of the likes not seen in North America since the Confederate States of America.  
---

### In 1943 inflation was held in check, yet cracks in the war-minded consensus broke out. Politically, conservative hostility to the New Deal reappeared. In the 1942 midterm elections, the Republican Party gained forty-seven seats in the House of Representatives and nine seats in the Senate.  
---

### after World War II, by choice or not, most American women would leave the factories.97 By 1947, female labor force participation would slip back to 28 percent. The breadwinner-homemaker family ideal held strong during the war, as it had during the Great Depression.  
---

### the male-breadwinner-female-homemaker family entered crisis, too.10 In 1973 the divorce rate hit 50 percent.  
---

### President Carter had appointed Paul Volcker chairman of the Fed in 1979. Thus Reagan became president in the middle of the Volcker interest rate “shock.”  
---

### Volcker surmised that the monetarist targeting of the quantity of money would provide good political cover for the job that needed to be done. By targeting the money supply, the Fed was not responsible for setting punishingly high interest rates. The market was deciding.  
---

### The triumph of “independent” monetary policy was one long-lasting result of the Volcker Shock.  
---

### **Tags:** #pink - The high interest rate of the Volcker Shock recruited short-term, speculative hot money into the United States, in search of the generous rate of return on offer. The consequence was to bid up the dollar, securing its role as the hegemonic global currency of transaction and reserve.  
---

### In 1982, capping the Volcker Shock deindustrialization cycle, Bethlehem Steel closed its sprawling Lackawanna, New York, steelworks outside Buffalo.
