### Capital is no inert thing, with an intrinsic value. The value of a capital investment, being in the flow of historical events, is always uncertain. Human agents, acting in concert, must capitalize, or instill pecuniary value in, an object.3 Through investment and disinvestment, they create and destroy assets.

### There are many ways to engineer and maintain the scarcity value of a capital asset. Land, say, may be ring-fenced. Law, for instance, especially property law, has been a foremost method.9 In its primal money form, the scarcity value of capital is much determined by the rate of interest.

### Liquidity is a relative quality of a commodity, including a subset of commodities—capital assets. First and foremost, a liquid asset is one that maintains its value over time.17 For its owner, it acts as a safe warehouse of value, and thus a store of wealth—a lull from disquietude. For much of history, money was a hard metal, like gold, that stabilized its value due to its lack of physical deterioration. When money enjoys a stable value over time, it thus acquires one attribute of liquidity.

### A new age opened after 1980, examined in Book Four, “The Age of Chaos.” Since then, I argue, there has been a relative shift to a capitalism defined by a very high speculative liquidity preference. Capital left fixed physical structures, to become more financial, intangible, leveraged, roving, and unsettled.

### Commerce, the exchange of one unlike thing for another, has existed for time out of mind. Capitalist commerce, or exchange in expectation of a pecuniary profit, is more specific and recent. It is characterized by forward-looking investment in the generation of gain through trade.

### The paradox that state authority should encourage the wealth-generating capacities of private commerce yet still restrain commercial self-interest—a dangerous impulse that threatened moral and political order—defined mercantilism. It would define the Age of Commerce. The “privatt profitt” motive was not enough. Even when it was active, a long-enduring English political-economic tradition said it must never run unchecked.

### In this context, the mercantilist economic concept of the “balance of trade” was a running scorecard tallying which imperial state was winning in the global zero-sum struggle over commerce. The doctrine had philosophical underpinnings, in the same neo-Aristotelian concept of a finite universe in which balance, not increase, was the natural state of affairs.

### By far the most organized Native power in contact with English North America was the Iroquois Confederacy, which had established trading alliances with various Indian nations. Through a trade in animal furs, the Iroquois absorbed early European settler-colonialists into their preexisting commercial networks.

### What British mercantilism did was to transform the North Atlantic into a vast imperial trading zone. Expanding territory was what empires instinctively sought to do. Over history, empires have proved to be very effective extenders of commercial markets across space, thus ensuring market demand for their various subjects. Smithian dynamics appeared within all European empires, as well as in Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, the Iroquois Confederacy, Qing China, the Ottoman and Persian empires, and the sub-Saharan Bornu Empire

### The short-lived financial panic of 1792 was the republic’s first. Deftly, Hamilton used Treasury funds to buy assets—today called “open market operations”—in order to bring back transactional liquidity and stabilize prices in the capital market. The panic quickly lifted.

### In economic life, prominent continuities existed much as during the long Revolution. In production, the organic economy endured. The Empire of Liberty’s greatest subsovereign, the household, remained the central economic institution. Smithian dynamics in commerce persisted, which meant that the geopolitical extension of markets across space was the engine of growth. Aggressive white land grabs of Indian possessions expanded the Empire of Liberty westward. The core postrevolutionary settlement, a politics of property, held firm.

### At the conclusion of the War of 1812, a number of national politicians who later became Whigs, led by the Kentucky congressman Henry Clay, put forward a long-term national plan for commercial development—the first since Hamilton. The federal government would manage land acquisition and sales, generating fiscal revenue. A steep tariff against foreign manufactures would protect young U.S. manufacturers and sponsor industrial production. The revenue from both would fund public investment in a coherent federal “system” of “internal improvements,” or the public infrastructure of roads, turnpikes, and canals necessary to expand access to market demand. From above, the BUS would manage the scarcity value of money, extending private credit when appropriate. Clay called his plan the “American System.”

### But speculations may not fix on objects of investment long enough for long-term economic development to happen. Capital just spins its top. And the speculative desire to leave all potential investment options open is only a fantasy. For if all options are kept open, but never exercised, nothing actually ever happens.

### Much as in the eighteenth-century British Empire, in the nineteenth-century Empire of Liberty, the owners of capital confidently invested in the long-term expectation of racial slavery’s future extension across space. A number of southern rulers, in fact, harbored fantastical imperial visions of slavery’s future.

### Enslaved people acquired many of the qualities of other capital assets. They were the object of private property rights, and they had the attributes of alienability and expected future pecuniary gain. At the same time, as capital assets, they possessed a number of unique economic qualities. First and foremost, enslaved persons were “portable.” Enslaved capital could be coerced to move across space, which was one reason why, during the Age of Commerce, slavery was such a dynamic factor in economic expansion.20 Land cannot be physically moved, and industrial plant and machinery were far more…

### most U.S. manufacturing production by far involved the processing of organic materials—wheat, leather, wool, and cotton. Lumber was important, too, as construction inevitably dominated manufacturing in growing cities. Western colonization required rural construction materials as well, for houses, mills, barns, carriages, wheels, and furniture. Due to its abundance, wood—not iron, let alone steel—remained the leading construction material.

### Economically speaking, emancipation destroyed $3 billion worth of enslaved property.5 White masters could no longer coerce black slaves to labor; they could not collateralize them in credit markets; they could not sell black lives in appreciating capital markets. The “complete destruction” of slave property without any compensation was, as the historians Charles Beard and Mary Beard argued almost a century ago, surely “the most stupendous act of sequestration in the history of Anglo-Saxon Jurisprudence.”6 It made the Civil War into the greatest turning point in the history of American capitalism, full stop.

### Most dramatically, to win the war, it floated a massive public debt in international capital markets. By mixing bank and state, the Union, while defeating the slaveholders, brought to life a new class of New York City financiers, invested in and dependent on the federal government’s future.8 A new political economy settled, cutting a path for long-term economic development.

### Before the war, enslaved capital had been the asset basis of the southern credit system. To capitalize a new asset class overnight, land being the obvious candidate, was not so easy.87 In 1865 few southern banks were left standing in the war-ravaged South. Few national banknotes or greenbacks circulated. Of the 1,688 national banks incorporated between 1865 and 1868, only 20 were incorporated in the five leading cotton-growing states.88 What emerged, quickly, was the crop lien—credit extended to planters on the promise of delivering future cotton.

### The slave economy of the past had an economic rationality that the era of Jim Crow racism would lack.98 Arguably, it was a more efficient capitalist economy, one that increased capital investment and labor productivity over time.99 Sharecropping did not do that. It incentivized the immediate expansion of cotton production, to pay off debts, but not greater long-term capital investment.

### The economic rupture cannot be emphasized enough. By the numbers, the industrial revolution gave rise to what economists call “modern economic growth”—self-sustaining increases in per capita income growth over time. Smithian growth had initiated the phenomenon. Nonetheless, industrialization represented a quantitative break from the past. The rupture was qualitative as well: the industrial revolution was civilizational in scope. Industrial societies became the world’s first urban societies.

Roughly 15 percent of world railway mileage passed through the city, and the Chicago railyards were the greatest anywhere.

### First, industrial revolution took place. Due to fixed investment in production, capital settled into more energy-intensive, illiquid capital goods. Over time, labor productivity increased on the supply side, and through long-term industrial economic development, wealth and money incomes grew—even though they were more inequitably distributed, relative to the past.

### Second, the capitalist credit cycle repeated. Here the timing was not linear. Periods of short-term speculative investment booms motivated industrial economic development, accelerating industrial revolution, but these episodes were followed by moments of panic and the competitive flight to safe liquid assets. Precautionary hoarding prevailed, demand collapsed, and development decelerated. Entrepreneurial energy enervated, as long-term investment in productive capital halted. Economic life was nervously pulled into the present, before confidence returned.

### A fearful, precautionary liquidity preference among the owners of capital broke out. They would not part with money to invest capital in employment-giving production.

### Despite the dramatic post-1933 price reflation and economic recovery, the immediate problem of the 1930s was not so much the regulation of enterprise and the distribution of incomes. Rather, long-term economic development remained disrupted because so much capital remained on the sidelines. The dearth of investment meant a dearth of employment-giving enterprise to generate labor incomes in the first place. Developmental policies had two subsets as well: state-funded public corporations that placed capital and credit in private hands, and federal programs that made direct public investment outside any private channel.

### In the postwar political economy, corporate managers’ long-term investment in industrial capital anchored what could be called a “fiscal triangle.”7 The fiscal triangle—the federal government, for-profit corporations, and nonprofit corporations; big government, big business, and big philanthropy—was the dominant political-economic coordinating mechanism of Cold War liberalism. Its task was the production, distribution, and redistribution of industrial income.

Fast-moving money, rapid investment and disinvestment, across various asset classes, as well as in and out of various companies, has not only overturned old methods of production—its logic has often threatened to overwhelm other economic patterns.
