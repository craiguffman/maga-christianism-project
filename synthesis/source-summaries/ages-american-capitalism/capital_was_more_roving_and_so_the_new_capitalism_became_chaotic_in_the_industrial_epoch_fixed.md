### Everywhere war energized mass popular expectations for long-term development and greater abundance. Afterward a generation of long-term private, illiquid investment in wealth-generating industrial production throughout the world would follow, settling down industrial society. Meanwhile, during World War II, fossil fuel industrialism further became entrenched. During the war, oil was a great strategic prize, after all.
