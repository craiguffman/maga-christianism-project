Certain backward-looking names are apt except that they refer to what it's not, rather than what it is. Examples include "postindustrialist" and "postFordist."

### Typically, each household consisted of a “head,” an adult man, who was the husband, father, and master. His dependents were his wife, children, servants, and slaves. Politically, the head of household was “independent,” vested with a civic status to participate in the polity, as well as to rule in the household—a subsovereign of the empire.

### Corn required tending about fifty days a year. It yielded a far more abundant harvest than did the European cereals wheat, oats, and rye. An acre of good land could yield 30 to 50 bushels of corn. Colonists ate corn puddings, breads, meals, mushes, and mashes. Distilled corn became whiskey, dried husks stuffed mattresses, and dried stalks served as toilet paper. Two acres could feed the typical colonial household. Five acres was an un-eatable abundance.

### Landownership, and a going farm, were not enough to make a man truly “independent.” English liberty had relational properties as well. An independent man was a head of household—a husband, father, and perhaps also a master with dependents of his own. The social hierarchies and thick personal relationships of household government shaped the economic lives of all.

### As masters claimed slaves as family members, and as public and private sphered, paternalists newly marked domestic slavery as private. In 1857 President James Buchanan told Congress in his first annual message, “The relation between master and slave and a few others are ‘domestic institutions,’ and are entirely distinct from institutions of a political character.”58 That meant the federal government, in addition to having no right to expropriate southern private property, had no right to intervene in southern private family life. The shift, in fact, resonated with the…

### Feinberg’s future was an entire civilization devoted to mass consumption. First and foremost, it was premised on the automobile, as it featured low-density, detached single-family homes in suburbs, where new shopping malls lined newly paved roads, highways, and parkways.
