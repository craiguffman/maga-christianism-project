## Highlights

### The United States was born with a political economy anchored in the widespread distribution of productive capital among white men—chiefly landed property but also enslaved black people.  
---

### American commerce was all but left free of corporate trading monopolies  
---

### within the English Empire, burgeoning colonial commerce properly channeled could increase the empire’s economic pie. That was the benefit of “free trade,” in the original meaning of that term: free trade within the empire. Within a well-ordered imperial political economy, everyone might gain from trade, even if the home country enjoyed the positive balance.  
---

### The Board of Trade—administrative inheritor of Shaftesbury’s Council for Trade and Plantations—was established in 1696. Locke was a member. By now, nearly two-thirds of English revenue came from taxes and duties on overseas trade, funding a powerful English fiscal-military state erected on the basis of wealth-generating commerce.  
---

### colonial households rotated corn, squash, and beans along with European cereals and legumes across three fields.  
---

### There was, however, a final coda to the political-economic debates of the long Revolution. After the War of 1812, the Democratic-Republicans decided Hamilton had been right: a National Bank was both necessary and proper. On April 10, 1816, President Madison signed the charter of the Second Bank of the United States.  
---

### Another result was the emergence of a distinctively American, anti-elitist, proto-populist, and pro-commercial politics of “antimonopoly.” Antimonopoly required equality of commercial opportunity and therefore prohibitions on “corrupt” government patronage and favoritism. Dramatically, Jackson killed off the BUS. In individual states, the Democracy led a social movement for democratic “open access” to incorporation. Corporations, long subsovereigns, began to shed their public status, migrating into the…

### was more cost efficient for a western Pennsylvania farm household to ship its goods down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, more than one thousand miles, and then coastwise to Philadelphia, than it was to transport those same goods eastward overland across mountains.  
---

### On average, thirty miles of overland transport approximated the cost of shipping goods across the Atlantic Ocean.  
---

### The chief cause of the expansion of money and credit in this period was that U.S. hard-currency reserves had increased, backing the multiplying banknote issues. In particular, silver mined in Mexico had swelled U.S. hard-currency reserves. Due to the British opium trade in Asia, this silver no longer flowed to China to finance Anglo-American transactions. It stayed in the United States, backing further domestic credit issues.90 In all this, however, the financial flywheel was the Bank of England.  
---

### Brazil and Cuba had domestic slave markets, but nowhere else in the Americas was there an interregional slave market like in the United States. Professional slave traders visited southern plantations and oversaw city slave markets, the largest being in New Orleans, where slaves on the auction block were poked, prodded, and examined.  
---

### Upper South plantations raised tobacco, hemp, and even wheat. The slave economy of Virginia produced the innovation of the McCormick reaper for grains.34 This region was more diversified, with respect to commerce and manufacturing. The organized movement for greater southern diversification and…  
---

### The aftermath of the Panic of 1837 was the next decisive economic event. Suffering from debt-deflation, many masters decided to make their plantations more economically self-sufficient and to rely less on commercial markets for foodstuffs. They would still rely on market demand for cotton, but would rely less on markets for the supply of some plantation necessities. The full-fledged U.S. “cotton and corn” system arose—distinct from the older, more cash-crop-oriented West Indian model—in which masters put sufficient acreage into corn to meet the plantation’s basic subsistence needs. This new “safety first” strategy was thus a check on commercial risk.  
---

### Transportation infrastructure was the key source of industrial expansion.67 By 1840, because of improved transportation due to state-backed internal improvements, geographically a coherent northeastern industrial corridor was rounding into shape.  
---

### President Lincoln was determined to end slavery’s geopolitical extension across space, that dominant theme of the Age of Commerce which, as we have seen, lay at the heart of the political-economic settlement of the Empire of Liberty. Moreover his proclamation that the United States could not forever exist half slave and half free meant that the Empire of Liberty was no more. Republican secretary of state William Seward glimpsed instead “the expansion of the empire of free white men”—an empire of free soil and free labor.  
---

### Cotton cultivation still required labor, of course, so armed with the Black Codes, planters sought to reinstitute something like large-scale gang labor, now called “squads.” But black resistance was massive.  
---

### More deflation was the solution to deflation, and more bankruptcy was the solution to bankruptcy—cries that would echo throughout the Age of Capital, through the Great Depression of the 1930s.  
---

### Bill Jones, a former machinist and Union Civil War captain, ran operations on the shop floor and became renowned for his expertise in production. Symbolically, Carnegie paid him the same salary as the president of the United States.  
---

### In the Age of Capital, the United States was a world agricultural powerhouse, exporting great volumes of many commodities. But in tandem with U.S. commitment to the deflationary gold standard, greater production contributed to falling prices, which exacerbated the debt burdens of many farmers.  
---

### The Farmers’ Alliance politicized railroad rate setting. During the Age of Capital, there was no farming—no life at all, including social connection—in the West without the market access provided by railroad corporations  
---

### In the wake of the Russian Revolution, an anti-Bolshevik red scare broke out. Everywhere in the world, including in the United States, organized labor was beaten back.  
---

### Virtually every known economic indicator went into free fall. Most worrisome was the crippling price deflation, the ongoing Depression’s most singular symptom.  
---

### Hoover was a progressive dynamo. Reserved in temperament and moved by his wife’s religious devotion, he worshipped technocratic expertise. During World War I, he organized private relief efforts in Europe to wide public acclaim. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt called him “a wonder,” exclaiming, “I wish we could make him President of the United States. There could not be a better one.”  
---

### “Back to the land” movements, tinged with nationalist, if not fascist nostalgia, were common across depressed industrialized economies.49 Not coincidentally, it was FDR who signed off on the construction of the Jefferson Memorial in 1934.  
---

### As the president waffled politically, the U.S. Supreme Court acted. In May 1935 the Court handed down its decision in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, striking down NRA codes, ruling them unconstitutional delegations of legislative power.74 FDR could not believe the decision was 9–0.  
---

### With an Open Door flavor, the 1934 Reciprocal Tariff announced U.S. commitment to trade liberalization throughout the world and granted the president the authority to negotiate bilateral trade agreements in order to slowly chip away at ever-tightening European imperial trading blocs. Further, many New Dealers supported national programs of economic “development,” which meant industrialization, throughout the world.21 In 1940, for instance, the United States provided capital, credit, and technical assistance to Brazil for the construction of its Volta Redonda steelworks.  
---

### After Pearl Harbor, Kaiser constructed “Liberty ships,” the Model T of the seas, in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, although his largest yard, funded with DPC capital, was in Richmond, California, north of his Oakland home.  
---

### By flipping the lights back on in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt, constructing a new industrial corridor in the Pacific West, and fashioning global supply chains, the Americans won the “war of the factories.” The pivotal year was 1942, when the United States produced $20 billion worth of munitions, compared to Germany’s $8.5 billion and Japan’s $3 billion.  
---

### “full employment” was a powerful ideological rallying cry, “free enterprise” and “private enterprise,” meaning government should leave all investment decisions to the private owners of capital, were phrases now commonly uttered by NAM, the Chamber of Commerce, and conservative congressmen.  
---

### Further, the fiscal triangle expressed a postwar ideology of three sharply separated spheres—government, economy, and civil society—which distinguished the United States from the specter of…  
---

### In 1971, for the first time in the twentieth century, the United States ran a trade deficit in goods with the world.  
---

### After decades of world economic recovery and growth, the dollar was now overvalued relative to other currencies. That hurt U.S. manufacturers at home and abroad. With them in mind, in 1973 President Richard Nixon’s administration broke the dollar-gold peg. The Bretton Woods international monetary system was over. Soon the United States lifted all cross-border capital controls. Now the value of the dollar would be determined in global currency trading markets—subject to the momentary whims of trade and speculative expectations.  
---

### The locomotive strategy was that the United States, West Germany, and Japan would stimulate their national economies. Their combined demand then would stimulate the weaker economies, which would focus on holding down prices and becoming more competitive, to sell in the American, West German, and Japanese markets.  
---

### At home, due to capital imports and financial deregulations, money and credit were more available. There was greater convertibility among assets, and more transactional liquidity. At the same time, still fearful of inflation…

### Unemployment reached 10.8 percent. The Fed ended the monetarist experiment in October 1982. A macroeconomic recovery ensued in the midst of newfound price stability. The shock worked. The dragon of inflation was slain.  
---

### Clinton Democrats went all in on Rubin’s version of a private-capital-markets-led globalization that was enabled,
