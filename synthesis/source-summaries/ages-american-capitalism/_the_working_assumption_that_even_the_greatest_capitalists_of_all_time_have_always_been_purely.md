## Highlights

### My position is that investment, the first mover, is the best perspective from which to watch capitalism at work. Without it, there simply cannot be wealth-generating labor and production, the market exchange of goods, and, what is ultimately the point of economic life, consumption.  
---

### The present in a capitalist economy is thus determined by a mixture of past expectations, still working themselves out through actions, and present expectations that relate future horizons, of various durations, back to the present. If expectations rule, then individual and collective psychological projections of the future play a dynamic role in a capitalist economy.  
---

### the working assumption that even the greatest capitalists of all time have always been purely rationally motivated to maximize their profits at all costs and against all other considerations simply does not hold up on historical scrutiny. The ideological belief that a capitalist economy is governed by a rational economic calculus intrinsic to our natures and dedicated to the pursuit of moneymaking is so deep-seated in our culture that it can be difficult to shake.  
---

### This is something of a paradox. The pull of profit expectations on economic life defines capitalism. However, the participants in a capitalist economy must be motivated to pursue its end—profit—by something other than that end.  
---

### The heart of the subject is this: dynamic amalgams, contradictory drives, and productive tensions account for the swirling motivations and factors, economic and not, that make for a capitalist economy at work.  
---

### For a capitalist economy to function, some asset or another must enjoy the attributes of liquidity. Capitalist economies need a relatively liquid asset as a psychological anchor. If it is not money it will be something else.  
---

### In sum, liquidity preference ties all three theses of the book together. It opens up to analysis the variety of factors at stake in the capital process that drive production but cannot be reduced to the productivity of capital; the liquidity of assets makes possible irrational forms of speculation and precaution that undermine any operative notion of a purely rational profit motive always at work behind economic processes; liquidity enables productive booms and enervating slumps.  
---

### This capitalism, which has so exacerbated inequality, has been fueled by the return of the capitalist credit cycle and speculative investment booms that, by historical standards, are very speculative indeed.  
---

### History does not confirm the belief in the existence of some economic mechanism through which the pattern of capital investment will simply lead to the best possible outcome so long as it is not interfered with. One likely outcome, among others, is that the propensity to hoard will win out, exacerbating inequality and crippling economic possibilities. As the profit motive is not enough, a high inducement to investment must come from somewhere outside the economic system, narrowly conceived. History shows that politics and collective action are usually where it comes from.

### It is difficult to appreciate, after the fact, what a fantastical project the quest for an Atlantic empire was at the time when Shaftesbury and other gentleman imperial capitalists embarked on it. Nothing quite like it had ever happened before. Convention offered only so much guidance. Shaftesbury may have been better informed about America than any man in England, but a thick fog of uncertainty remained.18 At a minimum, any oceangoing commercial venture or empire-building endeavor took months, if not years, even to attempt to execute. No one, including Shaftesbury, could reasonably have expected fulfillment of the Atlantic imperial project within a single lifespan.  
---

### Political economy would retain this core attribute—the refusal to separate states and markets, the joint pursuit of public good and private interest—throughout the Age of Commerce, far into the nineteenth century. Even if it has not been so dominant thereafter, this foundational mercantilist principle lives on, over the ages, to this day.  
---

### Mercantilists sought to increase national wealth, but they did not live in a capitalist world of exponential economic growth. No one ever had. The concept of a finite universe, with a finite stock of wealth and commerce, reflected what must have seemed an inevitable brute material fact in an economic world where most populations struggled to scrape above subsistence. A surplus must simply come at the expense of someone else—or from untapped riches from a so-called New World.  
---

### At first, the American colonies were supposed to be a “vent” not only for manufactures but also for the excess population of England. The first waves of migrants were largely Englishmen, many indentured servants. But because of migration, plague, and civil war, the English population began to decrease. Many officials, Shaftesbury included, now argued that England should retain its population.  
---

### The governor noted that every “foot of land,” up to the “seaside,” was in sugarcane.98 Plantations, each of which averaged 250 black laborers, maintained a detailed division of labor. Enslaved blacks were capital assets, priced competitively in Atlantic markets.99 They could be replenished through purchase. All things considered, it was often more economical not to worry over their rapid depreciation—in other words, to work slaves to death.  
---

### by the time the tobacco market boomed again, large planters had further consolidated their power by importing enslaved Africans. Black slaves became cost effective, relative to paying white indentured servants.114 By 1750 in Virginia, there were roughly 100,000 black slaves, about 40 percent of the population. An ideology of white racial domination hardened.  
---

### In preindustrial economies, without extending the amount of land under cultivation or increasing its productivity, very little growth was possible. Otherwise, there would not be enough food for everyone to eat, and not much labor could be shed from agriculture to manufacturing and commerce anyway. There could be no gains from trade, no division of labor, and no Smithian growth. In the end, however, only so much of the earth’s surface can be cultivated, and extending cultivation onto poor soils does not increase productivity. If, in commerce, the Smithian commercial multiplier is a possibility, allowing returns to economic activity to increase over time, then in agriculture, because of ecology, the specter of diminishing returns is ever present. Scarcity looms, as a brute material fact.  
---

### The relative abundance of land, not its scarcity, was perhaps the chief economic fact of the Age of Commerce in North America. Because of it, colonial Americans grew up to be taller, stronger, and healthier than their European peers.  
---

### Individuals’ relative position within the “little commonwealth” of the household, defined by sex, age, and race, determined their civic status. Men—husbands, fathers, and masters—were “independent” heads of household. Landed property was the anchor of their political “liberty.” Wives, children, servants, and enslaved persons were their “dependents.” A household was a social hierarchy where “reciprocal, not equal, rights prevailed.” So did love, but also cruelty.  
---

### In England, before the Norman Conquest of 1066, land could be alodial, meaning it was not subject to the rule of any feudal lord. Alodial land was the origin of what in the United States would become the “public domain.” After the Norman Conquest, the Crown claimed title to all the land in England. In theory, the king’s sovereignty was not up for sale. Land could be “held” by a subject but not “owned.” In practice, English land became subject to a system of tenures. The monarchy released its grip, and landed estates fell into the grasp of the hereditary nobility. Tenants-in-chief  
---

### European legal traditions said land could not be dispossessed, even from “savages,” without justification. Locke provided a justification, in the chapter entitled “Property” in his Second Treatise of Government  
---

### During the colonial period, roughly half of all willing migrants were indentured servants of some kind.72 There were two waves of white indentures, a seventeenth-century migration to the Chesapeake, and a subsequent eighteenth-century one to the Delaware Valley. Indentures normally lasted between four and seven years, and young men usually traveled in hopes of bettering their conditions and setting up their own households. Many succeeded. But legally, white servants and black slaves alike became members of their masters’ households.  
---

### Enslaved people had no legal right to exit the status. Colonial manumission was infrequent. Forty percent of all migrants to the colonies were African captives, and on the eve of the American Revolution, 20 percent of the British North American population was enslaved. Ninety-six percent of black people in the colonies were enslaved members of white households.77 While the remaining 4 percent were not enslaved, they had no secure legal standing to set up households of their own.  
---

### The peasant was no less hungry for land, and willing to grab it, but for different reasons. Lacking elite means to file land titles, peasants hoped “improving” land might be enough to ground a legally recognized claim. They wanted unimpeachable property rights because landed property and wealth—and only landed property and wealth—provided freedom from arbitrary interference over their lives. To get land from Indians, peasants did not so much subtly swindle them; they attacked them, violently, often bucking imperial authorities. This culminated, on the eve of the American Revolution, in the series of land-grabbing backcountry “Regulator” insurgencies.  
---

### Further, after centuries of mercantilist imperial state building, most actors appreciated that the political and the economic were thoroughly entangled. The idea, in the words of the historian Gautham Rao, “that the state and the marketplace must be distinct simply did not exist.”5 And in this era, politicians—not men of business enterprise—were most responsible for charting the republic’s long-term economic future.  
---

### Hamilton and Jefferson were both republicans, but not all republicans shared the same political beliefs.49 American revolutionaries called themselves “Whigs,” and both Hamilton and Jefferson identified with the Whig legacy of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Both idealized the eighteenth-century British Empire, when the colonials had it good, and both argued that the Revolution had been necessary because George III’s policies had strayed from the true principles of British liberty. But after the Revolution, Hamilton’s republicanism moderated, while Jefferson’s radicalized, or at least it became even more anti-British. Certainly, he believed, Hamilton’s “scrippomania” was not in the spirit of  
---

### Generally speaking, the proportion which the aggregate of the other classes of citizens bears in any state to that of its husbandmen, is the proportion of its unsound to healthy parts, and is a good-enough barometer whereby to measure its degree of corruption. While we have land to labour then, let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work-bench, or twirling a distaff.  
---

### the war leveled tobacco markets, and Jefferson, among other Virginia planters reconsidering their views, even toyed with slave abolition.58 He inspired the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which banned slavery in the Old Northwest  
---

### **Tags:** #pink - Jefferson’s long-term political-economic program, no less fervently motivated than Hamilton’s, was simple: Expand the agrarian white yeoman republic across space. Look West.59 Above all, Americans needed Lebensraum. They must have property rights to secure their liberty. There would be commerce. Landed property was capital, but it was also something more. Land would ground a moralized republican political “independence” and “virtue.” White gentry and yeomen would merge into a rural “middle landscape,” an enlightened equipoise of commercial self-interest and rural republican simplicity. The virtuous subsovereign households of the republic would bask in “that happy mediocrity of condition.”  
---

### Hamilton had the first chance at power. His fiscal policies were startlingly successful.73 U.S. commerce boomed. But somehow, politically, Hamilton still went down to defeat.  
---

### in some respects Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty came to resemble the eighteenth-century British Empire.100 Congress revoked all internal taxes. The military budget was cut in half.101 A provision of the 1789 Constitution, the Commerce Clause, granted Congress the authority to regulate commerce “among the several states,” forbidding interstate mercantilist discrimination. The result was to check state discrimination, opening up a unitary commercial space and increasing the extent of markets and thus the demand for goods. Empires, while forging common political jurisdiction, accommodate pluralism and difference in rule, often so that different elements in the empire…  
---

### Fighting a war, in 1805 Britain passed numerous restrictions on neutral U.S. shipping.108 On republican principle, the United States lacked the state capacity, including the naval power, to push back. So in December 1807 Congress followed Jefferson and passed an embargo forbidding all American vessels from sailing to foreign ports. Foreign ships were prohibited from exporting American goods. They could bring select imports but must then sail away empty, in ballast. Jefferson had, effectively, outlawed commercial prosperity. In 1808 U.S. exports plummeted dramatically, and so did customs revenue.109 Unpopular at home, the embargo failed abroad.  
---

### Jefferson retired to Monticello with his administration in tatters. But he had had enough of U.S. commercial dependence on Europe.110 The embargo would redirect American economic life inward. A home market would provide demand. Jefferson now spoke of the American “manufacturer” and the American “husbandmen” working “side by side,” both producers together in a perpetual struggle against parasitical, unrepublican merchant-speculators.  
---

### In the Southwest, General Jackson now waged total war.116 In March 1814 he eliminated a Creek army at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. We have conquered “the cream of the Creek country, opening a communication from Georgia to Mobile,” he boasted.  
---

### But at the national level, a popular democratic mobilization of white heads of household dramatically overthrew not only monarchy but also any vestige of aristocracy or oligarchy.119 The national party of elites, the Federalists, would not take charge over the union. National plans for economic development were abandoned. Jefferson’s Empire of Liberty won out. Bottom-up, popular Republican nationalism, the colonization of Native American lands, household governance, the extension of slavery, and commercial self-interest would have to hold the union together.  
---

### the Democracy’s transformation of U.S. political economy would be a greater rupture than even the Revolution. President Jackson summed it up in his 1837 farewell address: “There is but one safe rule, and that is to confine the General…  
---

### Clay argued, reasonably enough, that the chief problem at hand was that the United States remained commercially dependent on “foreign nations,” especially the  
---

### The president ended the bank veto with stirring words. “It is to be regretted,” Jackson lamented, “that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.” For: In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers—who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government.  
---

### In order to legally secure open access to commerce, a Jacksonian jurisprudence developed that was solicitous of private property rights but hostile to any “special” or “class” legislation.67 Sphering public from private did not mean that state power, in its proper constitutionally limited domain, must be weak. Far from it. The Democratic Party built a more public and professional state bureaucracy.68 Under the banner of “antimonopoly,” New York and other cities deregulated their public food markets. But other utilities, like municipal waterworks, became exclusively public and state operated.69 Jacksonians acknowledged public regulation and state “police power” at the local level. In all instances, Jacksonian political economy gave rise to a new concern for boundary policing between public governance and private commerce.  
---

### Ever since the seventeenth century, the transition to a more market-based economy had consisted not of a one-off moment but rather of market engagements and retrenchments, market revolutions but also counterrevolutions, all specific to geographical place.  
---

### But the catching of the developing U.S. economy in the snares of capital markets governed by the British bank rate was the ultimate cause of the bust. Money and credit tightened, and spending dried up. It was the third debt-deflation slump in national history.  
---

### After the Panic of 1839 sovereign debt crisis came a Jacksonian revulsion against state-funded internal improvements. States ceased to invest in private corporate stock and began to tax property to raise revenue instead.103 This was another instance of Jacksonian sphering in political economy, an attempt, at once ideological and legal, to delimit the private commercial sphere from state infringement.  
---

### No corporations, not even joint-stock corporations, were legally mandated to pursue commercial profits to the exclusion of all other projects.105 The profit-maximizing corporation, familiar to the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, had not arrived yet on the scene, and there would first be much experimentation with the corporate form, which was still quite malleable.  
---

### Americans in Thoreau’s day had lived through a series of credit-fueled commercial booms followed by financial panics and debt-deflation slumps. But soon after the twin Panics of 1837 and 1839, the commercial economy roared back to life, and many, not only Thoreau, felt that commerce was beginning to impinge on economic life, even just on life, in ways that it had not before. Commercial self-interest was jumping outside its age-old checks, be they moral disapprobation or a nonnavigable river, and conjuring a world of its own. The market extended indeed, boring into Americans’ very beings. Not only political economy but social and cultural life, and even psychological and ethical life, appeared to be at stake. What kind of society was a “commercial society”? What kind of person succeeded or failed in it? What did ever more commerce do to the human soul?  
---

### Commerce was premised on self-interest but required sympathy to function. There might be ethical tensions, but commerce presupposed a willingness to bargain, within agreed-on conventions of value and representation, without resorting to violence.  
---

### Over the centuries, every single financial crisis there has ever been has been a crisis of confidence. Why is capitalism so dependent on interpersonal trust and the psychological state of confidence? When Americans panicked during the Panic of 1837, after all, they literally panicked.12 Why is capitalism always a bit of a confidence game?  
---

### By design, the system did not have enough hard currency to pay off all debt. Present truths were insufficient to compensate for the future fictions. Because a capitalist financial system is a perpetual leap of faith, over and over again, confidence becomes the emotional and psychological mainspring of economic activity.  
---

### American democracy had become false because outward commercial appearances had triumphed over inner realities. The gap between the two had grown so great that reality could no longer even be represented by appearance.  
---

### Melville purchased a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, next to an old family estate. On the side, he became a working farmer, planting corn and potatoes. When Moby-Dick—arguably the greatest American novel—was published, it was a commercial flop.  
---

### The Confidence-Man’s fictional steamship Fidele has no kings, aristocrats, peasants, or lords. There are no families, no households, no fathers, sons, or daughters. There are no masters, and there are no slaves. The characters have no histories. The state is absent, and so is legal authority. Even the stability of the land is absent. The entire novel takes place on the Mississippi River, as commerce then often followed the waterways. On the Fidele, nothing happens at all besides commercial bargaining. Commerce itself is the warp and woof of human relationships.  
---

### On the Fidele, loneliness breeds not self-knowledge and independence but “melancholy” and “depression.”50 Individuals are too immersed in commercial transactions even to recognize themselves once they are removed from them. There is no longer any fixed point outside commerce, no law, no God, no self, no reality, no truth. Is it all humbug? We have no independent standpoint left from which to even tell! The Confidence-Man is a novel whose main protagonist is doubt. Doubts experienced by the characters; doubts experienced by the reader trying to unravel the layers of the seeming hoax. Melville wrote the greatest of all highbrow humbugs.  
---

### The miser’s misery is a moral lesson. In a commercial society, anyone who hoards his confidence—refusing to trust others—is isolated and miserable. He is no wise transcendentalist, sitting peacefully and calmly at Walden Pond keeping a journal by himself. In fact, he is pathologically ill. Melville saw the transcendental retreat from commercial society as miserly, in a moral sense. He seems to have been saying that social appearances must sometimes be embraced for there even to be a reality. Perhaps commercial society had put the metaphysical cart before the horse. But there was no going back. The only thing left to do was grab the cart and pull it oneself, constructing ourselves moral values—uncertain ethical investments, but still ones that might bear fruit.  
---

### Disguising their names, Melville used Emerson and Thoreau to express the rising Victorian sentiment that commerce cannot be trusted. Unfeeling and heartless, it must be kept within its proper sphere. A hard wall must always separate the market from the warm sentiments of friendship and family. The market is always pushing against its own boundaries, threatening to corrode other spheres, and must be vigilantly walled off from them.  
---

### If transcendentalism forbids financial assistance among friends, it becomes a moral tyrant. Capitalism may be premised on uncertainty, warranting skepticism, but uncertainty need not undermine genuine moral values and commitments. A pragmatic ethical hope is possible.  
---

### In principle, multiple varieties of capitalism can coexist and prosper within the same imperial polity. In fact, the historic role of early modern empire had been to accommodate local differences and to create a composite political order,…

### The average price of a slave in 1850 was $300. In 1860 it was $800, while a “prime” field hand in New Orleans fetched $1,800. The nearly 4 million U.S. slaves at the time were worth a combined $3 billion. Southern slave property was far more valuable than southern lands—or even northern factories.16 Three billion…

### The cotton economy was not all there was. At the behest of masters, slaves planted other crops: rice in South Carolina, and sugar in Louisiana. New Orleans, Mobile, and Savannah handled and serviced the cotton trade, but cities like…

### In sum, through a series of successive upswings in the capitalist credit cycle after the War of 1812, the Panic of 1819, and the Panics of 1837 and 1839, southern white slave owners grew powerful and wealthy. They did so via three…  
---

### Every idle hour for every slave was a carried cost. Cotton was a seasonal crop, with annual spring planting and fall harvesting seasons. Its cultivation could not occupy every single waking hour of every slave’s life. Idle time became filled with subsistence production. In 1850, on U.S. cotton plantations, 38 percent of the average slave’s labor time was devoted to cotton, but 31 percent went into corn and the care of livestock, with most production by far directly consumed on the plantation. Another 31 percent went into tending other subsistence items

### Paradoxically, the post-1837 turn to “safety first” strategies, even if best interpreted as a capitalist hedge against risk and a way to squeeze all possible economic value from all the members of enslaved families, created an opportunity for paternalist ideologues to reinvent the…

### Lincoln had always said that slavery was morally wrong. The founders had not intended it to last. But politically Lincoln was more moderate. In states where slavery was legal, slaveholders had property rights protected by their state governments, whereas the federal Constitution was silent.138 In the western territories, the federal government had the authority to determine whether slavery should exist. There, he said, it must act, prohibiting slavery and thus bottling up the institution in the South where, eventually, it would perish.  
---

### The era’s second dynamic was the speculative cycle of boom and bust, dominated by confidence games—psychic energies, not fossil fuel energies. Its time signature was not linear. Rather, it repeated.  
---

### The Union military economy could be characterized as follows. The federal government did not commandeer private economic activity but issued money and debt to further capitalize it. After a long period of northern Smithian growth—defined by a transportation revolution, the growth of banking, greater market density, and incipient industrialization—the government could…

### the wage labor contracts violated the Yankee free labor doctrine of “employment at will.” Blacks could not quit employment in jobs governed by such contracts. Southern lawmakers passed the Black Codes, which promulgated outrageous unfreedoms. In the fall 1865 harvest, many planters failed to pay wages and instead offered workers slave rations.58 Stevens’s argument that abolition alone was not enough was looking convincing.

### The large majority of Republicans from the bank- and finance-rich districts of the Northeast supported the measure. But a bloc of Radical Republicans, largely from the Midwest, led by Congressman Stevens, broke ranks. Resumption had split the Radicals.

### Sharecropping contracts listed the amount of land to be tilled for each crop, and soon enough the landowner-tenant split of the crop settled at 50-50.

### In 1868 Jay Gould was thirty-two years old. Starting from humble origins in New York’s Catskill Mountains, by the time the Civil War broke out, he was living in New York City. On credit, he acquired a stake in a small railroad corporation. He was by all accounts a shy, wispy, and reserved man, but he soon enough became the greatest financial operator in U.S. history.  
---

### The brothers put their fingers on the main point. The issue was not private greed—unchecked commercial self-interest, after all, had been a moral problem time out of mind. Rather, corporations and the legal privileges that state legislatures bestowed on them in their charters were becoming vehicles of private acquisitiveness at a scale hitherto unimaginable.  
---

### Sensing an opportunity, Jay Gould swept in and took control of the tottering Union Pacific.150 Not only had resumption channeled credit to Wall Street, at the expense of other regions  
---

### Scott schooled Carnegie in the logic of industrial capital. Operating cost determined selling price. Profit in the face of fixed and running costs demanded high operating volume and velocity so as to achieve dynamic economies of scale.  
---

### Carnegie stumbled upon a common issue in the Age of Capital. For centuries, in commerce, the goal had been to buy low and sell high, given competitive market prices. Early manufacturers knew the cost of their raw materials, or of labor, because market prices for them were available. But the larger the industrial enterprise, and the greater the fixed investment, the more difficult it became to tabulate the costs of manufacturing—using up capital by running a furnace, or moving around materials—because there were no markets, internal to a firm, to price these activities. The Pennsylvania Railroad, among other railroads, had led the way in developing new methods to account for such operating costs that could not be priced by markets. What was called the “operating ratio” among railroad accountants measured revenues in excess of production costs—per unit of output, over time.  
---

### 1870 was the year that coal surpassed all other energy sources in U.S. manufacturing, but it still accounted for only 25 percent of all energy use. 1885 was probably the year fossil fuels became the dominant energy source.  
---

### Due to their potentially multiplying effects, commerce and manufacturing bring increasing returns to economic activity. In agriculture, however, diminishing returns always loom. There is only so much land on the face of the earth, and some parts of it are less capable of yielding a bounty than others.  
---

### Chicago anchored the western region of the manufacturing belt, but it was also the eastern terminus of a second economic geography, the West—spanning Dakota wheat, Texas cattle, and Arizona copper.  
---

### By contrast, while the agricultural industry dominated U.S. exports, farmers at this time had no choice but to accept the international prices for their goods.  
---

### By 1900 some 20 percent of all U.S. manufacturing output was processed foods.115 That included Pillsbury’s flour, Campbell’s soups  
---

### Merchants began selling the elevator certificates as speculative objects, then created “futures” contracts, to price and trade commodities that did not yet exist. Futures enabled farmers to hedge their products in the fields against price fluctuations. No less, it allowed merchants and dealers, even the public at large, to speculate on futures prices in the “pits.”  
---

### The Union Stockyards were capitalized in 1865 at a gargantuan $1 million fixed cost by the Chicago Pork Packers’ Association and the city’s nine largest railroad corporations. These stockyards could handle over 100,000 animals. In a premonition of Henry Ford’s assembly line, workers struck hogs on the head with mallets, then hooked them onto a mechanized “disassembly line,” feet first—cutting their jugulars to bleed out the animals to death. Cattle, by contrast, were simply bludgeoned until dead.  
---

### Also uncommonly, he was willing to negotiate with labor unions, including the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, formed in 1876. The Amalgamated was a “craft union,” consisting of highly skilled, highly knowledgeable male laborers who combined to bargain with their employers over wages and working conditions.142 In 1878 Carnegie had instructed Captain Bill Jones to cut wage expenditures, but Jones shot back, “Leave good enough alone.” “Low wages,” he lectured Carnegie, “does not always imply cheap labor. Good wages and good workmen I know to be cheapest labor.”

### Falling steel prices were the fruits of the company’s productivity gains, delivered to its owners. Carnegie believed that workers’ wages should fall accordingly. But sliding wages threatened the aspirations of young, transient, single male wage earners, who perhaps hoped to earn and then quickly move on

### Setting aside the ultimate validity of Marx’s theory, the late-nineteenth-century U.S. industrial economy was something like a caricature of Capital. Much as Marx predicted, industrialization led to a system-wide drive to produce more wealth. But many U.S. industrial capitalists kept complaining about their profit margins. The United States had the world’s longest workday, ten hours in 1880, and capitalists and workers fought over its length

### In December 1915, Ford financed the Peace Ship and personally traveled to Europe on a publicity campaign to talk soldiers out of the trenches. That did not work. The U.S. economy boomed, exporting raw materials to Great Britain and France. Wall Street financed their war debts. German militarists judged that U.S. economic power, even under a neutral flag, might eventually tip the balance, and so Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare against U.S. ships. Congress voted to enter the war in April 1917. The United States did help tip the balance, and an armistice was declared in November 1918.

### In November 1932, the return on three-month U.S. Treasury bonds hit 0.05 percent, around which it would hover throughout the 1930s. The Fed’s cautious open market operations—purchasing short-term, near-cash-equivalent securities to prop up their prices and lower their rates—had lost power as early as 1931.  
---

### By 1932, no increase in the supply of money could make the owners of capital willing to part with it and spend. Nor could it prompt inflation. Precautionary liquidity preference—the demand for cash and other safe liquid assets—was simply that high. Investors invested in assets with near-zero pecuniary returns. The profit motive had disappeared—or at least, no one believed there were any future profits on offer.  
---

### Capitalism was not going to lift itself out of the slump—it was stuck in the short-term present. Fear was so intense that the owners of capital favored the psychological return of security over seeking pecuniary profit—to wait it all out instead of investing. Many other people with money to spend joined them. Not just capitalists but ordinary Americans were running on banks and removing deposits, then putting the money perhaps under a mattress, if not in a hole dug in the ground. Due to fear, much economic activity simply ceased.

### It was not the New Deal but World War II—the subject of Chapter 14, “New World Hegemon”—that finally pulled the United States out of the Great Depression. The “total energy” of total war did the trick, even if the war economy was good only at producing bombs, tanks, and airplanes.  
---

### By now, with World War II in the past, liberalism’s only developmental vehicle was the income tax code. Otherwise, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty” was insufficiently funded. Together with the Vietnam War, the 1964 tax cut left behind a national macroeconomy that was booming, to be sure, but overstimulated in some places and underresourced in others. Massive political protests erupted against the dissatisfactions and inequities of postwar society, and liberalism began to crack up.

### Social Security catered to industrial, male wage earners, working in large corporations where payroll taxes could be easily collected. The program excluded rural and domestic workers, many of whom were members of minority racial and ethnic groups. Initially, only 15 percent of all wage-earning black women were entitled to Social Security benefits.

### Industrial production peaked in October 1943, at which time manufacturing, in value-added terms, reached its highest share in all of U.S. economic history.  
---

### This time the driver was not a speculative investment boom, which was up to this point the most dynamic impulse of American capitalism. It was the federal government, which stamped one factory onto the ground after another. In but three short years, U.S. economic geography radically changed.  
---

### At the outset of the war, labor had been calm. Leadership of both the AFL and the CIO had supported a “working-class Americanism” that patriotically submerged class conflict. Unions signed no-strike pledges.  
---

### despite blemishes, the CIO was by far the most racially integrated of the more important national institutions. The war economy opened up significant opportunities for black workers. In 1941 A. Philip Randolph, head of the all-black AFL auxiliary Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, visited FDR in the Oval Office and threatened a mass march on Washington. The president relented, issuing the executive order that “there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.” The federal government created the Fair Employment Practices Committee

### No executive order, however, prevented a number of spontaneous “hate strikes” against black workers in the summer of 1943. In Detroit, 25,000 Packard Motor Company workers went on strike when two black workers were promoted to nonmenial positions.

### **Tags:** #orange - In the United States, the 1945–48 hinge saw a great industrial strike wave, contests over full employment legislation, the appearance of inflation, the reappearance of threats of capital strike, and a red scare. But by the time it was over, the U.S. owners of capital had seized back control over capital investment. In politics,…  
---

### By inclination, many New Dealers were hostile to Wall Street. Further, at Bretton Woods, delegates from Latin American, Asian, and African countries hoping to industrialize their national economies gravitated toward a vision of the postwar world economy that favored long-term investment in production, even at the expense of globe-spanning private capital mobility.  
---

### But postwar America opened up a new frontier, so to speak, in the commodification of politics, as civic identity became entangled with consumption in ways that it had not been before. “Abundance” became an entitlement of economic citizenship.16 The line between citizen and customer, rights and gratifications, blurred. Even democratic politics increasingly became yet another form of consumer entertainment, although that did not necessarily mean citizenship became less dignified.  
---

### **Tags:** #orange - Capitalism demands an orientation of economic life toward the future, and so the constant urge to look back, and nostalgically stamp past ages “golden,” is probably some kind of psychic compensation for the unremittingness of that demand, especially in moments when, to many, it feels difficult to muster a positive vision about the future.  
---

### After 1973, not just industrial employment but industrial productivity, profits, and wages, by various measurements, all sagged. Manufacturing would hardly disappear—roughly, it would retain its share of “value added”

### Friedman was by far the most ideological member of the influential Chicago school of economics, but he was not the only one. Of his generation, George Stigler worked on regulation, attacking the liberal ideas of “public utility” and “natural monopoly.”108 The Law and Economics movement was born in Chicago. Its most influential

### The deregulatory National Gas Policy Act of 1978 was, at first, a success. But the drift now was not to write better market regulations: even among liberals, it was to throw in the towel on market regulation altogether. When Carter sent trucking deregulation legislation to Congress in 1979, he promoted “increasing reliance upon the competitive marketplace.” He signed an executive order mandating that all federal agencies cease to “impose unnecessary burdens on the economy, individuals, public or private organizations, or State and local governments.”  
---

### Capital markets dependent on transactional liquidity seized up when trading evaporated. The magical belief that there would always be a market to sell an asset, or at least a willing creditor to fund it, went up in smoke. A panicked flight to security ensued, an extreme desire to convert assets for cash—or the most cashlike asset…  
---

### Just because a market advocate such as Friedrich Hayek or Milton Friedman once said something about the market does not mean that when Reagan became president, something in particular came to pass. In reactive mode after Reagan’s election, much of the intellectual left fell prey to assuming it did, hauling out a neo-Victorian, romantic critique of the corrosively greedy “market.”4 But to debate the appropriate moral limits of the market—a salutary debate, to be sure—is not to say all that much about how and why capitalist enterprise since Reagan has changed.  
---

### Of the president’s economic advisers, Volcker concluded, “They had monetarist doctrine, supply-side doctrine, libertarian doctrine all mixed together.” It “wasn’t terribly coherent.”8  
---

### Volcker was not a complete believer in Milton Friedman’s monetarism, which argued that economic growth always followed, after a lag, from an increase of the money supply, and that inflation was always and everywhere a result of the money supply increasing too much. The Fed, Friedman thus argued, should always target a steady increase in the money supply that approximated the capacity of the “real” economy to grow—“real” meaning independent of money. Strangely

### The metaphor of body and plant appeared time and again. Lackawanna steelworker Dick Hughes said, “You feel it’s a part of your life, it’s a part of your body….It’s like getting a part of your stomach cut off, if the plant closes.”  
---

### If step one during the Volcker Shock was the decision among the owners of capital to hoard cash and earn short-term profits through interest rate accrual, during the post-1982 expansion, step two was indebted speculative investments, to hurdle over high borrowing rates through leverage. Thus the great “discipline of the market,” promised by Carter, Reagan, and Volcker alike, failed.58 Instead, a rather undisciplined upswing in the capitalist credit cycle occurred. Its premise was the belief that transactional liquidity—a funder, if not a buyer for all assets—would always be present in what was fast becoming one big interconnected capital and credit market.  
---

### Corporate raiders could never have pulled off the shareholder revolution by themselves. They needed help in the capital markets. Joining corporate raiders were institutional investors, especially public and private pension funds. In other words, accumulations of capital that were the result of the postwar politics of pay funded changes in corporate governance that, ironically enough, undermined the politics of pay. The critical economic site shifted from income to property.  
---

### pension funds bought “portfolio insurance,” in which computers automatically sold off stocks from their portfolios if stock prices declined. The academic theory behind portfolio insurance assumed transactional liquidity, “that continuous trading was possible”—that there would always be two sides for a trade, and not everybody would always be on the sell side.  
---

### Discussions of “fundamentals”—what a business actually did—still mattered in valuation, but asset prices, throwing off capital gains, might delink from what was supposed to be their anchor in the “underlying” business profit of the firm, made from using up capital in wealth-generating enterprise and labor.  
---

### Moreover blue-collar job loss had become difficult for the entire political culture to stomach. Something must be wrong in an economy where female employment in health services surged, while male manufacturing employment declined.  
---

### Altogether American society saw a loss of control, and of a capacity to deliberately create economic outcomes.

### In 1968 ARPA funded the construction of a network through grants to the first four “network nodes” at the University of Utah, Stanford, UCLA, and UC–Santa Barbara.18 By the time the first ARPANET transmission was sent in 1969, Taylor had quit the Pentagon in protest of the Vietnam War. In 1970 he landed in Silicon Valley to run the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center

### Just as Ford had built automobiles as a hobby while working for Edison, Wozniak kept his day job at Hewlett-Packard. Jobs, for his part, had worked as a line assembly engineer at Atari, Silicon Valley’s greatest video game company. Atari was funded by Sequoia Capital, the first “Sand Hill Road” venture capital firm, founded in 1972 by Don Valentine, a former employee of Fairchild Semiconductor.

### At the same time, something truly new was arguably at work during the 1990s. The hypervaluations of many new economy firms that made no business profits whatsoever opened up the possibility that financial asset appreciation might delink altogether from business profit making, demanding the establishment of new

### Apple’s corporate culture was and is Silicon Valley through and through, but good luck mapping its Asian-focused global supply chain, let alone the complex tax avoidance network of its corporate subsidiaries in Switzerland, Ireland, and the Cayman Islands.

### during the 1990s a new global, cosmopolitan consciousness was born. During the twentieth century, by choice or by necessity, industrial capitalists had tied their fates to nation-states.88 Now many owners of wealth were not so sure. New York, London, and Tokyo, all centers of finance, became recognized as “global cities,” where trends in food, fashion, and design began to move in unison.

### The more uncertain the global economy became, in other words, the more it relied on one certain anchor: the dollar. U.S. hegemony facilitated economic globalization; economic globalization needed U.S. hegemony.

### U.S. homeowners expected that housing prices would go up and up, sustaining their consumer lifestyles despite flat average pay and a declining share of labor earnings in total income. How long could it all last?

### President Bush signed the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which forced executives to endorse their companies’ accounting statements at risk of their personal liability.

### In the United States, a distance emerged—at once economic but also social, cultural, and political—between places that remained the most economically dynamic in the world and those that did not benefit so much from globalization and suffered for it greatly.  
---

### Growth at all costs, heedless of losses, let alone profits, remained a corporate strategy during this decade. This led to some aggressive investment strategies and monopolistic tendencies—defying the governing Law and Economics movement, which had stripped the law of many antitrust enforcements on the assumption that short-term, rational profit maximization among firms would always increase competition to the benefit of all consumers.

### People with flagging pay and labor earnings prospects tapped their homes to maintain—not increase, but simply maintain—their level of personal consumption.

### Moody’s, a publicly traded company after 2000, used mathematical models, just like the banks, to predict default risk by plugging in historical price data that hailed from a time when the market was different, because it was vastly more geographically disconnected.

### “Who owns residential credit risk?” asked two Lehman analysts in September 2007.84 In the end, while the Fed and Treasury subsidized the banks’ recovery, that risk was passed down to 10 million foreclosed homeowners—4.6 percent of all homeowners. In the end, they, not their creditors, bore the downside risk. Undoubtedly, many distressed homeowners would have loved access to zero-interest loans from the Fed.85 Very few bankers were prosecuted, and fewer convicted.

### With Dodd-Frank signed into law in July 2010, the Obama administration was largely politically spent. Undoubtedly, without the 2009 stimulus, the Great Recession would have been worse economically.105 Politically, the stimulus was nonetheless a great failure. In the aggregate, it was simply not enough to close the gap in demand. At the same time, if only because of its reliance on tax cuts—given the dearth of public investment plans, and the lack of political will or capacity to carry them out anyway—the stimulus lacked the facility to push economic life in any particular, better direction. Republicans reaped great political benefits from these shortcomings.  
---

### Paradoxically, if a new age does soon issue forth, one reason why will be the many continuities that have marked economic life since the Great Recession—which then looked like it might be a significant historical rupture, but in the end was not. The Age of Chaos continued. The change to come will be more consequential if only because for a long time not all that much has changed.

### **Tags:** #pink - When in March 2020 financial markets collapsed after the outbreak of COVID-19, the Fed, like in 2008, came to the rescue, cutting new paths in the arena of post-2008 “unconventional” and “accommodative” monetary policy. In fact, the Great Recession already appears to have only been a dress rehearsal for 2020. In March 2020, immediately the Fed stepped in to prop up asset prices, including supporting the troubled corporate debt market, something it did not do in 2008, because the corporate debt market was not then so distressed, but also because officials believed that to do so would have been a dangerous public encroachment upon private markets.

### **Tags:** #pink - Not coincidentally, the United States, perhaps the most capitalist of all countries, has long been distinguished from other countries for its pronounced historical amnesia. In American capitalism, the urge to dispense with the past has led to many flights of economic fancy. Most recently, this happened with the new economy of the 1990s, when it was believed by many powerful figures that the U.S. economy had somehow moved “beyond history.” End-of-millennium faith in a finance-led vision of globalization, which persisted, incredibly enough, after the panic of 2008 and over the Obama years, may have been consigned to the dustbin of history by Trump’s 2016 election and then COVID-19. But we still live in the aftermath of that project.
