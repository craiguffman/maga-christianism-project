# Democracy

Path: Book Four: The Age of Chaos, 1980- > Preface: Chaos > Scholars can't agree on what to call our new economy. Certain backward-looking names are apt except that they refer to what it's not, rather than what it is. Examples include "postindustrialist" and "postFordist." Names that refer to it a repeat of a past period don't work either, such as "Second Gilded Age" and "neoliberalism."
