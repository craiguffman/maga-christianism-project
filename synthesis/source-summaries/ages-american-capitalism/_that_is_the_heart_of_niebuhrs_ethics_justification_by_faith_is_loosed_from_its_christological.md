## Highlights

### To write this book, I have learned and drawn from a tradition of thought in economics, sustained in the twentieth century by such thinkers as John Maynard Keynes, Thorstein Veblen, Joseph Schumpeter, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, and Albert Hirschman. I have also drawn from the pre-twentieth-century, so-called classical political economists that many of them engaged with, above all Adam Smith but also Karl Marx.  
---

### I would argue for the rightful place of historical analysis in economics, and for a broader vision of what the economy is. Dormant traditions in economic thought once argued for this position. Seeking to revive them, I have tried to recut a wider path in order to make room for the inclusion of many subjects‚Äîspanning, say, politics and society, or environment and psyche‚Äîthat once were but today are not typically seen as relevant to understanding the economy in which we live. My conviction is that these subjects and many others are relevant.  
---

### The emergence of capitalism must, in part, be explained by an historical oddity: the appearance of a new ability and willingness to invest that kick-started new kinds of wealth-generating labor and production.  
---

### much more recently, before 2007, another appreciating asset, the ‚Äúmortgage-backed security,‚Äù was considered by the largest banks that traded them to be very liquid‚Äînearly as liquid as cash‚Äîuntil, due to rising home mortgage defaults, its value was questioned. Suddenly confidence collapsed, and they and nearly all other assets somehow tied to them became not tradable at all‚Äîilliquid.  
---

### Thus the propensity to hoard has triumphed again in our own times. The weakness of investment‚Äîin terms of quality and quantity‚Äîis the key economic problem. If there is one argument, quite prominent over the past decades, that this book argues against, it is that the free mobility of capital will accord with any rational or intelligent design when left to its own devices‚Äîthat private investment will result in the greatest fulfillment of economic potential, with an allocation of goods that is reasonable, optimal, and just. I object to this argument.  
---

### The origins of American capitalism are to be found within the history of a particular political project that mixed varied impulses into a dynamic amalgam that created something new. The project was empire.  
---

### In the end, a different long-term republican vision for U.S. political economy won out, the Virginian Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs Empire of Liberty. This settlement made a politics of property‚Äîwidespread property ownership in land and slaves among white male heads of household‚Äîthe anchor of U.S. political economy. To ensure that, it focused on the commercial and slave-based colonization of the agrarian West.  
---

### Smith admired the commercial character of British North America, and today many consider him to be something like a patron saint of capitalism, as, supposedly, he was critical of all government intervention into ‚Äúthe market.‚Äù3 That was not so.4 Smith was a theorist of political economy, of the relationship between the ordering of power and the generation of wealth. He made no categorical separation between the political and the economic, or state and market. The question for him was their relationship and the consequences of their complicated overlap. The wealth of nations could be the result only of good policy making.  
---

### Everyone may gain from trade. The wealth of nations grows. This is what economists today call ‚ÄúSmithian growth,‚Äù the combined and interactive result of self-interest, the division of labor, and the extent of markets.  
---

### In seventeenth-century thought, there was no such thing as ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù as a distinct sphere from other arenas of human experience, as it is known today.  
---

### No matter how absolutist the pretensions of the Crown were or were not, imperial sovereignty was more aspirational than accomplished. What historians call ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù and ‚Äúplural‚Äù rule, in which authority was dispersed to different institutions, was common, even inside England.62 Tellingly, joint-stock corporations‚Äîsubsovereigns of a composite empire‚Äîwhich were owned by private investors, were first granted the task of colonizing North America and governing English subjects.  
---

### In principle, colonial commerce existed to favor England‚Äôs balance of trade. The colonies should not produce manufactures but instead should import them from England, stimulating English employment and exports. The colonists must not trade with England‚Äôs enemies but must give the home country its commerce. Cromwell‚Äôs Navigation Act of 1651 codified a long-standing rule that all colonial trade be conducted in English ships.  
---

### Shaftesbury never attempted to make the British imperial political economy a completely closed circuit. There would be ‚Äúinterlopers,‚Äù smugglers, and pirates, and the strict enforcement of the Navigation Acts might actually hinder the growth of English colonization and trade.81 Shaftesbury‚Äôs governing disposition approximated what Edmund Burke, in the throes of the American Revolution, would later christen ‚Äúa wise and salutary neglect.‚Äù82  
---

### What determines the division of labor? The answer is the ‚Äúextent of the market,‚Äù or the scope for sales. That is, there must be sufficient transactional liquidity‚Äîready markets for goods on the demand side. When markets expand for goods, producers compete for them. They specialize and invest more capital in search of the gains from trade. They do this because of a natural human propensity to ‚Äútruck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.‚Äù It is commercial self-interest, or human nature, that is the mainspring of the division of labor. But the division of labor exists only in proportion to the ‚Äúextent of the market.‚Äù  
---

### The household was the central institution of early American economic life‚Äîthe central institution of life, full stop.17 Kinship, custom, law, and intimacy defined their character. Households carried out the task of ‚Äúoeconomy,‚Äù or the management of household wealth. Households were also governing institutions. In a world of ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù and ‚Äúplural‚Äù sovereignty, where imperial authority could be weak on its frontier, households, along with corporations, were the ruling subsovereigns of the British Empire.  
---

### When the American Revolution broke out, at least 80 percent of the population still worked the land, and no more than 5 percent lived in cities, defined as urban settlements of 2,500 or more. An account of early American economy must attend to the interacting rhythms of organic economy and household economy, as commerce progressed in the midst of their cadences.  
---

### colonizers brought with them to America a property regime that did not always make sense to Native Americans. It was a most peculiar English legal institution: private property. Private meant having the power and right to ‚Äúexclude‚Äù others‚Äîeven the state, if only to some extent‚Äîfrom the prerogative to enjoy the possession, use, or exchange of a particular object.  
---

### North America had more smallish landowners of capital than did Europe. ‚ÄúThe hopes of having land of their own & becoming independent of Landlords is what chiefly induces people into America,‚Äù noted a New York official.35 As John Locke explained, without secure property rights in land that was free from arbitrary interference, there was no guarantee of republican liberty.  
---

### Many northeastern American Indian communities were seasonally migratory, even if they often still engaged in horticulture, such as the Narragansett, Massachusett, and Wampanoag, populous Algonquian-speaking nations of New England. In such indigenous polities, sovereignty and property did not commonly equate to permanent, fixed possession of land, in either its public or private guise.37 Sovereignty flowed more from human relationships than from territorial possession, which then mapped onto control over resources, justifying multiple claims to them. Controlling land use made sense, as did acknowledging another nation‚Äôs possession of a loosely bounded territory  
---

### What did not make much sense to most Native American nations was to completely abstract land from the ‚Äúlife activity‚Äù of relationships in the human and spiritual worlds, and for individuals to assert exclusive claims to land backed by the coercive apparatus of law.  
---

### improvement became an argument for why English public and private property‚Äîits commons and its independent plots‚Äîmight justifiably dispossess Indian lands.  
---

### As for marriage, Blackstone explained: By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband: under whose wing, protection, and cover, she performs everything; and is called in our law-French a feme-covert‚Ä¶.Her condition during her marriage is called her coverture.68  
---

### Colonies used household government to ameliorate pauperism and poverty. That is, instead of funding almshouses or conducting ‚Äúpoor relief,‚Äù some colonies paid heads of household to take in orphans, as well as the elderly and the disabled.76 The distinction between ‚Äúservant‚Äù and ‚Äúguardian,‚Äù another of Blackstone‚Äôs oeconomical relations, could be fuzzy.  
---

### By these measurements, in 1774 the colonies were economically more equal than is the United States of the early twenty-first century. Back then, the top 1¬†percent of earners  
---

### By contrast, the gambler regarded landed property as capital. Desiring future pecuniary income, the gambler chased what Adam Smith called the ‚Äúgains from trade.‚Äù  
---

### Gambler and peasant alike desired secure land tenures and property rights, but they had different motivations. The gambler wanted property rights in order to secure his pecuniary investment in a capital asset. In colonial America, a speculative capitalist land market flourished.  
---

### What Jefferson was saying was that an economic life of commerce alone was too unstable to adequately ground an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù household. The household had to be able to support itself. Only when it produced a surplus above what it consumed was it time to head to markets, in order to exchange for that which the household did not or could not produce, or to gamble on the gains from trade.  
---

### After Britain‚Äôs costly Seven Years‚Äô War with the French Empire, however, its Stamp Act of 1765 placed a new levy on American property to raise imperial revenue. More taxes, as well as London‚Äôs repeated attempts to rein in colonizers‚Äô incursions onto Indian lands, brought about the antagonisms that led to the War of American Independence.  
---

### Only a second war with Great Britain, the War of 1812, secured a lasting national independence. By then, the character of the republican political economy that emerged from what might be called the ‚Äúlong America Revolution‚Äù  
---

### After ratification, when Madison and Hamilton, two ardent 1780s ‚Äúnationalists,‚Äù arrived in New York City to implement the new Constitution, they came as allies.  
---

### Next, Hamilton proposed that the federal government assume all state debts. Finally, the federal debt would be permanent. The reissued U.S. bonds carried no maturity dates. The principal might never be repaid, but interest payments would extend into the infinite future. At present, Hamilton said, the federal government would service only interest payments. To do so, he calculated that the new federal government would need $2.8 million in annual revenue. There would be small internal taxes on property, such as an excise on the production of alcohol. Hamilton also proposed an ‚Äúimpost‚Äù on foreign commerce, a modest tariff on imports‚Äîby English manufactures mostly.  
---

### By 1790 less than 2 percent of Americans owned Revolutionary War debts.29 Hamilton‚Äôs measures granted these elites a windfall payout‚Äîface value, in hard currency, at reasonable rates of interest.  
---

### Jefferson believed that slavery, someday, by someone else‚Äôs doing, would die out. Blacks must return to Africa. Indians should civilize or be conquered. In 1780 Jefferson first called this vision an ‚ÄúEmpire of Liberty.‚Äù His vision of a postrevolutionary settlement was a politics of property, a political economy of widespread white male property ownership.  
---

### Later, he would recall Hamilton as a singular character. Of acumen outstanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example, as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation.  
---

### The project of republican nation making should not, in his view, be hitched to financial profit seeking. After the creation of a permanent public debt and an incorporated national bank, Jefferson was sure a litany of British horrors would come next: financial oligarchy, government patronage, parasitical bureaucracy, heavy taxation, a standing army and navy, wars. Aristocracy by birth, perhaps even monarchy, might return.  
---

### Next, the ‚Äúincitement and patronage of government‚Äù would be required to inspire nervous private citizens to invest in manufacturing. In particular, Hamilton said governments must attend to the ‚Äúconfidence of cautious sagacious capitalists.‚Äù67 To induce industrial investment, he proposed that the government make direct subsidies to select U.S. manufacturers‚Äîtoday called the ‚Äúindustrial policy‚Äù of picking winners. Also, Hamilton approved the chartering of a manufacturing corporation in New Jersey, the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures  
---

### A month later a U.S. army offensive defeated an Ohio Valley confederacy of thirty-five Indian nations in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville  
---

### The Federalists had originally hoped to control and slow the pace of settlement, much as prerevolutionary British imperial officials had done. They would acquire lands from Indian nations, by treaty, and sell off large blocs to wealthy speculators  
---

### the result of Jackson‚Äôs two presidential administrations was a dramatic national political realignment. Jacksonians‚Äîself-styled inheritors of Jefferson‚Äôs legacy‚Äîcalled themselves ‚Äúthe Democracy.‚Äù Their opponents called themselves the Whigs.  
---

### What held them all together was a critique of the way private elites exclusively enjoyed government ‚Äúprivilege.‚Äù Instead, they affirmed ‚Äúequal rights‚Äù for all white men.  
---

### These men, Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed, ‚Äúare fanatics in freedom; they hate tolls, taxes, turnpikes, banks, governors, yea, almost all laws.‚Äù66  
---

### New Orleans cotton prices leaped from 9 cents per pound in 1831 to 15 cents in 1835. The Old Southwest‚Äôs cotton frontier spread yet again. Cotton exports doubled between 1831 and 1836, reaching an all-time high of 63 percent of all U.S. exports.  
---

### Even as Jacksonianism gridlocked the federal government, a state-government-led ‚Äútransportation revolution‚Äù in market infrastructure facilitated commerce. All told, between 1787 and 1860, the federal government would invest $54 million on transportation infrastructure, whereas the states collectively made public investments of $450 million.  
---

### The history began as far back as the 1790s, when many states, northeastern ones especially, had chartered joint-stock turnpike corporations. Before, roads were commonly poor paths carved through forests, often by citizens laboring to ‚Äúwork off‚Äù their tax obligations.  
---

### New York City, which had captured the southern cotton transshipment trade, now expanded to include goods from its upstate agricultural hinterlands, becoming the Empire of Liberty‚Äôs undoubted commercial colossus.  
---

### 1841‚Äì42 Louisiana, Maryland, Illinois, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Mississippi, Indiana, and the Florida Territory all entered default. Ohio and New York barely escaped.  
---

### Perhaps the adequate regulation of commercial self-interest did not need a supervening state authority, as the mercantilists had believed, or even moral exhortation in the tradition of the ‚Äújust price.‚Äù All it needed was what we call proper ‚Äúbusiness ethics‚Äù today.  
---

### What if human beings in a commercial society, instead of hacking each other to death, haggle with each other in order to live, but treat each other falsely, as instrumental means to their own future personal commercial ends? What if they are all artificial and inauthentic liars, merely trying to turn a buck? With so much commerce buzzing in their ears, many antebellum American writers and artists were obsessed with this dilemma, worries that commercial appearances had swallowed reality and that life was becoming nothing more than a confidence game.  
---

### if there is no confidence or trust, then there can be no commerce. Hoarding trust can be as dangerous as hoarding capital. The cost in both instances is an absence of investment in the future. Wisely, Hamilton had warned of the ill economic effects of ‚Äúcautious sagacious capitalists.‚Äù  
---

### Thoreau and Melville wrote during the period of literary history that scholars call the American Renaissance. A period of just seven years saw the publication of Emerson‚Äôs Nature; Addresses and Lectures  
---

### Just as, shrewdly, Barnum did not claim to be an authority on his own humbugs, the world of paper money no longer had a central authority to tell anyone whether what they saw had authentic value. After Jackson killed off the Second Bank of the United States, interpersonal trust and credit became even more a basis of what Hamilton had called ‚Äúpecuniary capital.‚Äù Farmers had their land; slave owners had their slaves. But tradesmen had trust, and without trust, instead of constant credit creation, a final reckoning would arrive‚Äîthe moment when all debts came due. If it did arrive, the result would be bank runs and financial panics.  
---

### What was there to limit or check the radical uncertainty of commerce? Tellingly, who was not inside the American Museum? What noncommercial forms of authority were absent from the scene? No king, no politician, and certainly no central banker was present to distinguish appearance from reality. The American Museum was no family farm‚Äîno father was there to decide, no slave master was present. And God?  
---

### A democratization of truth was happening inside the American Museum, which placed on individuals the democratic duty of making judgments. In the American political economy, neither Henry Clay‚Äôs American System, nor any other long-term political project of development, was directing commercial prosperity. The money and credit necessary to capitalize commerce and commercial production now bubbled up from below, in the form of democratic, interpersonal acts of trust, as well as a popular state of confidence and expectations. Arising from these excitements, doubts, and questions, emotional states and psychological drives fueled the speculative upswing in the credit cycle, which induced investment and pulled along commercial development.  
---

### To Herman Melville, Thoreau‚Äôs transcendentalism was a moral tyrant. Melville also recognized that many moral checks on commerce were fading fast, and he was worried, too, but he came to think differently from Thoreau about the morality of capitalist commerce. Rather than celebrating the market or pushing back against its always-corrosive effects, Melville wondered if commercial investment might be appropriated as a means toward a morally worthy end.  
---

### Historically, the best measure of capitalism‚Äôs presence may not be the presence of its many defining features‚Äîcapital, market activity, technological innovation, wage labor, or something else. All these things have existed to greater or lesser degrees for a long time, even if just at the margins. What defines capitalism‚Äôs presence, rather, is not a presence but a relative absence. In the United States, the Age of Commerce had arrived at a point where it made sense for Melville to ask the following question, and to write an entire novel mulling over it: What would happen if economic life‚Äînay, life itself‚Äîwere nothing more than a running series of commercial transactions in pursuit of future pecuniary gain?  
---

### On the Fidele, there is a pervasive sense of estrangement and distrust. The passengers, Melville never tires of telling us, are all ‚Äústrangers.‚Äù Melville used the word stranger no fewer than sixty times in The Confidence-Man.  
---

### the moral universe presented in The Confidence-Man is somewhat terrifying. Everyone is a confidence man, and everything is a confidence game. It is all skin and no meat. A sense for truth succumbs to a deep skepticism. If full withdrawal from commerce breeds only lethargy and melancholy and no social intercourse whatsoever, what is left beyond loneliness? What is left, it would seem, is an even more terrifying nothingness, a true existential ‚Äúfalsity,‚Äù to return to Thoreau.  
---

### **Tags:** #pink - Melville‚Äôs miser, hoarding the hard currency of gold for precautionary rather than speculative reasons, is the most liquid. He keeps all future options, all desires, all possible future speculations, open and alive. Yet by continuing to hoard pathologically, the miser never exercises any of his options. Death will come to him before any enjoyment in life does. Hoarding and speculation are of the same complex.  
---

### An American capitalism with more nationally uniform characteristics would be the result of the political history inaugurated by the Republican Party, a radical political agent born in 1854, which drew support from a rapidly changing northern economy and captured the federal government in 1860. It would‚Ä¶

### What most changed in the South after 1840 was not so much the economy. The dynamics of the post‚ÄìPanic of 1837 cotton boom were quite similar to those before. What was new was the rise of a paternalistic slaveholding ideology that was professedly inimical to unchecked commerce. American slave capitalism transformed due to paternalism‚Äôs triumph.  
---

### What historians call ‚Äúpaternalism‚Äù in this context was an unlikely nineteenth-century Christian ‚Äúinsurgency‚Äù to reform the most draconian aspects of slavery.44 Paternalism had two core features.  
---

### Slaveholders granted their slaves ‚ÄúNegro plots‚Äù to cultivate on Sundays, their one day off. Slaves clung to them tenaciously, claiming informal property rights and transforming these plots‚Ä¶  
---

### In the South, no matter what the paternalists said about commerce, the household remained the basic unit of enterprise. By contrast, in the North a rupture took place. There the romantic idealization of family life occurred in a different economic setting, creating a different kind of energy and tension. Northern economic production began‚Ä¶  
---

### Manufacturing clung to the waterways, as waterwheels transferred power to millstones by wooden shafts. Nearly everywhere in 1850, steam power cost more per unit of horsepower than did water.68 Large-scale manufacturing, when it occurred, took place in dispersed rural mills.  
---

### Inside the shops, employers and employees were ‚Äúmasters‚Äù and ‚Äúservants.‚Äù Master ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù employed ‚Äúapprentices‚Äù and ‚Äújourneymen,‚Äù former apprentices who aspired to be ‚Äúindependent‚Äù mechanics.72 Servants were legally bound to fulfill the contractual terms of employment, subject to the disciplinary authority of their masters. Home and work were often the same place.  
---

### In 1832 no less than 40 percent of the remunerated U.S. manufacturing workforce was women or children. They were all paid less to perform the same work as adult men. The larger the manufacturing establishment, and the larger the capital requirements, the more firms relied on unskilled female and child labor. In textile firms with more than fifteen employees, 73.4 percent of employees were women or girls.76 In large-scale cotton plantations and large-scale textile manufacturers alike, the labor of women and children was the key swing component.  
---

### The status of waged work was changing greatly in the North. Rather than a household dependency, it was becoming a variety of free labor. Ideologically, wage work was transforming from a dependency associated with femininity to a badge of male independence. Legally, it transformed masters and servants into employers and employees with different sets of legal obligations. Notably, the free labor doctrines emerging in the United States were quite ‚Äúradical‚Äù compared to those of other countries.90 They were not the foreordained endpoint of capitalist development.  
---

### The abolition of slavery in the North inaugurated the history of free labor there. New England abolished it first, in the midst of the Revolution or shortly thereafter.91 Elsewhere it took more time.92 A critical moment came when masters attempted to enroll emancipated slaves in long-term contracts as their servants. Northern legal decisions overturning these ruses undermined long-term contracts of all kinds, including even some forms of apprenticeship.93 Free labor required more than the abolition of involuntary servitude; it would also require the outlawing of many kinds of coercion and unfreedom in the workplace.  
---

### What emerged, slowly, was an American right to quit work, a doctrine formalized legally decades later as ‚Äúemployment at will.‚Äù Indentured servitude and legal punishments for ‚Äúabsconding from service‚Äù during the length of a labor contract fell by the wayside. Corporeal punishment of workers, even where and when it remained legal, was no longer practical, since workers, if beaten, often simply walked off the job‚Äîand demanded compensation for work already performed.  
---

### The gender ideology of ‚Äúseparate spheres‚Äù was yet another example of public and private sphering, giving rise to a new tension specific to an industrial society that was premised on borders from without rather than entanglements within. This was different from paternalism, which sought to draw oppositions by parsing the moral and economic morass of the plantation household.  
---

### Over the next century, however, nothing, not even the new industrial factories, would be more central to the industrial order than the breadwinner-homemaker family, which arose as yet another late‚ÄìAge of Commerce solution to the same old problem: how might commerce be promoted, yet still be checked and kept within its proper bounds? During the 1840s and ‚Äô50s, the organization of family life made it clear that North and South gave two very different answers to this question. The growing distinction, which occurred in tandem with an economic divergence, contributed to the convulsion in politics.  
---

### Douglas‚Äôs 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act overturned the Missouri Compromise. The 36¬∞30' parallel banning slavery to its north would no longer apply in lands acquired through the Louisiana Purchase. Instead, ‚Äúpopular sovereignty‚Äù would also determine slavery‚Äôs fate in the new territories of Kansas, which extended west into present-day Colorado, and Nebraska, which then extended north to Canada. In these territories, white male heads of household would vote on whether to have slavery.  
---

### For decades, the corn-and-hog complex of the Ohio River Valley was commercially connected to the slave plantations of the Old Southwest. In 1830 the Ohio-Mississippi river system took virtually the entirety of northwestern commercial traffic. In future decades, northwest commerce would shift from the southwest to the northeast. A contributing factor was the South‚Äôs post‚ÄìPanics of 1837 and 1839 retreat to ‚Äúsafety first‚Äù subsistence strategies, in the context of the shift to paternalism.113 Northwestern foodstuffs were less in demand in the South. New interregional railroads linked the Northwest and the Northeast over the mountains. Altogether, by the 1850s, most northwestern goods were shipped by rail to the East rather than downriver to the South.  
---

### The construction of railroads in the Northwest commercially connected that region to the Northeast, diminishing southward commerce down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Rather than ameliorating north-south sectional political discord, after‚Ä¶

### In 1860 the value of black slaves exceeded the total value of the U.S. industrial capital stock. The political destruction of enslaved capital alone was bound to initiate a new age of American capitalism. That the most intensive period of industrial revolution in all of U.S. history occurred in the decades after the Civil War was no coincidence. The Age of Capital saw the emergence of an industrial capitalism.

### On May 20, 1862, Lincoln signed the Homestead Act into law, which offered loyal citizens and immigrants 160 acres of federal land from the public domain. After they paid a ten-dollar fee, then lived on and improved the land for five years, it would be theirs to keep.  
---

### In February 1862, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act, which authorized the issue of an irredeemable paper currency and legal tender, called ‚Äúgreenbacks‚Äù because of their green ink. During the war, Congress printed $250 million in greenbacks.32 Gold remained the currency of international transactions, while greenbacks, joining banknotes and U.S. bonds, became a currency of national commerce.  
---

### The Confederate Army went hungry, while planters‚Äô bales of cotton rotted on docks due to the Union naval blockade. Then, as the tax-in-kind fell on yeoman households, massive tax resistance erupted. In 1863 mobs of women in Richmond promised ‚Äúbread or blood.‚Äù  
---

### McCulloch became the first comptroller of the currency, the office in charge of issuing the new national banknotes. He became Treasury secretary in 1865, determined to retire the greenbacks from circulation and to put the dollar back on a metallic standard.  
---

### To commit to an invariable metallic standard, the United States would have to devalue its currency and fiscally retrench. It must close budget deficits, signaling to investors that it would never help finance them by inflating away the value of the public debts, owned by the government‚Äôs creditors.68 Austerity would mean that wartime taxes could be rolled back, if not eliminated, also placating private investors fearful of taxation. The high tariff, while necessary to fund gold payments on the debt, could also be radically reduced. Federal revenue should be devoted to retiring greenbacks, bringing the ‚Äúgold premium‚Äù closer to prewar parity, and extinguishing the U.S. public debt.  
---

### In particular, black women, whether in the planters‚Äô fields, or in white homes‚Äîas cooks, washers, ironers, seamstresses, chambermaids‚Äîwithdrew their labor. The old plantation household was dead, as black families demanded and won greater autonomy over their labor.  
---

### 1867 Congress formed a peace commission to negotiate treaties with Plains Indians. More than a decade before, in 1851, the Treaty of Fort Laramie had acknowledged the sovereign possessions of the Great Plains tribes, while granting the United States the right to establish roads and build military forts. At an 1867 council in Medicine Lodge Creek, in Kansas, some members of Southern Plains peoples‚ÄîComanche, Kiowa, Apache, and southern Cheyenne and Arapaho‚Äîceded tribal lands to the federal government. In 1868, at another council at Fort Laramie, some Crow, Lakota, northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho ceded their lands, too. These Native American peoples would thereafter live‚Ä¶

### The failure of Jay Cooke & Co. set off a financial panic. Loans in the call money market hit 360 percent.148 Depositors rushed to remove their deposits from New York banks, for fear that, caught out, they might fail as well. Creditors called in their loans. European investors, who had no less than ¬£82.7 million invested in U.S. railroad securities in January 1873, repatriated their capital.149 Confidence collapsed. Precautionary hoarding broke out. The collapse of credit and prices depressed spending and commercial activity. Railroad stocks lost 60 percent of their value. Half of all U.S. railroad corporations tumbled into bankruptcy.

### Three-quarters of the earth‚Äôs anthracite deposits once resided in a five-hundred-square-mile region that runs from the aptly named town of Carbondale, in northeastern Pennsylvania, southwest through the Lehigh River Valley to Pottsville, on the Schuylkill River. It became the first American coal mining region.  
---

### Thus the mid-Atlantic region industrialized differently from New England. It specialized in the production of intermediate capital goods, like metals and machines, rather than consumer goods such as textiles. In New England, waterpower drove the textile mills, so they flourished in small, rural villages.44 But in the mid-Atlantic, the backward and forward linkages of coal, steam, iron, and steel first appeared in urban settings. By 1870 there were seven hundred steam engines in the anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania.45 Cheap coal made the stationary steam engine economical in manufacturing. Greater urban agglomerations of manufacturing became possible, which created network effects. Urban population growth strongly correlated with the adoption of the steam engine in manufacturing.46 In the city factories, the coal-fired steam engine ran continuously, at command. Unlike waterwheel or windmill power, steam power was impervious to the natural rhythms of climate and weather. Carnegie ran his steelworks twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  
---

### Having invested in the new capital goods, many of the larger firms in the manufacturing belt settled in place, determined to realize profits from their past sunk investments. Accordingly, smaller firms located around larger, successful firms. A lot of productive capital fixed on the ground, as an industrial geography that would last until World War II settled in place.  
---

### No one had ever seen anything like Chicago, the world‚Äôs fastest-growing city during the Age of Capital.69 Born a commercial hub of the Old Northwest, Chicago became something more, and something new, an industrial city of unprecedented spatial organization and scale. What made it possible were the combined emergent properties of the industrial economy of coal, steam, iron, and steel.

### On the southern plains, cattle overgrazing led ranchers to drive herds northward. In the two unusually harsh winters of 1886 and 1887, as many as one million cattle perished in what came to be known as the ‚ÄúGreat Die Up.‚Äù Fleeing winter storms, cattle blindly piled into farmers‚Äô barbed-wire fences, where, trapped, they froze to death.  
---

### Ford had a final motivation: he was also in the business of producing men. The five dollars were not a daily wage. A portion was called a profit share, granted only under certain conditions. The worker had to live the right way, as the company‚Äôs ‚Äúsociology department‚Äù administered the five-dollar-day program. As one Ford manager explained, an unskilled worker received ‚Äú$2.34 per day for working‚Äù and ‚Äúanother $2.66 for living as the company wanted him to live.‚Äù ‚ÄúDrinking‚Äù and ‚Äúriotous living‚Äù were forbidden, as were ‚Äúlack of thrift,‚Äù ‚Äúdomestic trouble,‚Äù and ‚Äúindebtedness.‚Äù The sociology department conducted home inspections, such that ‚Äúthere was nothing to keep from them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis man lives in a dirty unsanitary hut,‚Äù Ford records read. Or ‚ÄúPolish wedding, Drunk.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy wife told them everything,‚Äù one worker lamented. Ford‚Äôs vision was total.

### Most important, the market autocorrection of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù economy must occur without government interference. These were very sophisticated logical arguments, made by very intelligent economists, in defense of economic suffering. They were wrong.  
---

### In the history of American capitalism, one may isolate this moment: the liquidity trap of the fall of 1932. From it would issue a long historical arc, into the twenty-first century, from the Great Depression to the Great Recession. Along its path an escape from the liquidity trap would be achieved during World War II, which induced‚Äîby public investment‚Äîa long-term industrial investment boom in productive capital assets.  
---

### Cities fared little better. In the winter of 1932, unemployment in Detroit and Chicago reached as high as 50 percent. The most vulnerable‚Äîwomen, children, the elderly, the disabled, minorities‚Äîsuffered the most. The rate of black unemployment doubled that of white unemployment. Men, women, and children lined up for bread, foraged in streets, rummaged in trash cans, and lived in ‚Äúrusted-out car bodies‚Äù or ‚Äúshacks made of orange crates.‚Äù  
---

### Around himself he assembled many advisers, who made different, sometimes contradictory suggestions. Much to their amazement, the candidate would agree with them all. ‚ÄúYes! Yes! Yes!‚Äù ‚ÄúFine! Fine! Fine!‚Äù Thus intellectuals thoroughly underestimated FDR. Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once said of FDR that he had a ‚Äúsecond-class intellect‚Äù but a ‚Äúfirst-class temperament.‚Äù Journalist Walter Lippmann referred to the incoming president as ‚Äúa kind of amiable boy scout,‚Äù without ‚Äúa firm grasp of public affairs and without very strong convictions.‚Äù Hoover thought the Democratic nominee a hopeless lightweight. Upon FDR‚Äôs landslide victory over him in 1932, he predicted disaster.  
---

### FDR indicated he would support a provision in Congress‚Äôs Emergency Banking Act, enabling the executive to control international and domestic gold movements. The new law granted to the president the power to take the United States off the gold standard. On April 5, 1933, FDR signed an executive order ‚Äúforbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.‚Äù  
---

### Next, the New Deal attempted a dizzying variety of policy experiments. The overarching keyword that motivated them all was security. The primary goal was control: to de-volatize capitalism and to employ breadwinning men.  
---

### No less, the New Deal would draw from America‚Äôs homegrown illiberal traditions. The white supremacy that maintained its grip on the South was no monument to liberty, and FDR was willing to cooperate with southern racists, as he needed Democratic votes in Congress.  
---

### In the spirit of trying something, during the First Hundred Days, congressional legislation made quite dramatic interventions in commercial markets, to restrict supply and thereby reflate the economy.  
---

### The Banking Act of 1935 reformed the Federal Reserve System.91 It increased the powers of the system‚Äôs Washington-based board of governors. The board, its chairman, and its vice-chairman were now to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate and were independent of the regional banks.  
---

### A large share of the economy-wide productivity gains during the 1930s have been attributed to the building of roads, tunnels, and bridges. Schools, post offices, train stations, and airports were also built. The ‚ÄúPWA Moderne‚Äù architectural style featured solid massing, evoking stability, and lines that swerved, as if they were electric.128 What had been called ‚Äúinternal improvements‚Äù in the Age of Commerce increased the national extent of markets, bringing about an Age of Control wave of Smithian economic growth.  
---

### In the late 1930s, it was needed. Capitalists themselves still suffered from disquietude and were falling down on the job of investment, hoarding out of precaution instead. Keynes proposed in The General Theory that a volume of investment sufficient to end mass unemployment would likely ‚Äúprove impossible without a far-reaching change in the psychology of investment markets such as there is no reason to expect.‚Äù Keynes wrote, ‚ÄúI conclude that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.‚Äù The General Theory recommended ‚Äúa somewhat comprehensive‚Ä¶  
---

### Some historians have argued that the New Deal‚Äôs turn toward budget deficits in 1938 represented the ‚Äúend of reform,‚Äù since New Deal liberalism became preoccupied with adjusting macroeconomic aggregates rather than transforming the core institutions of capitalism through political and legal interventions.155 The attempt to induce greater private investment by slashing taxes on the owners of capital‚Äîa core policy staple of New Deal liberalism over the decades, persisting to this day‚Äîconfirms such an analysis.  
---

### From price, wage, and profit controls, to high rates of income taxation, the extraordinary interventions taken by the federal government to restrain the price level and halt inflation are worthy of note‚Äîgiven their implications for the long-term fate of New Deal liberalism in the Age of Control. When the state held down interest rates on short- and long-term loans in order to induce private fixed investment, and issued debt to finance budget deficits and public investment, it pulled in untapped resources: labor, machines, and technological know-how. That led to the growth of total output and employment. But there were limits. Should there be no more resources left to draw from, should the ‚Äúmacroeconomy‚Äù reach its productive limit, monetary and fiscal expansion might lead to inflation‚Äîmore money chasing a limited amount of goods. There is nothing wrong with inflation per se.  
---

### The urgency to employ male breadwinners would dominate the dramatic postwar hinge, when the political economy of New Deal liberalism finally settled in place. The issue would be inseparable from the question of on what terms and by what principles the federal government would attempt to rebuild the war-torn world economy, given both the blunt power of U.S. economic and military might and the hegemonic aspirations of a triumphant cultural Americanism abroad.  
---

### In military terms, the Soviet Red Army, an unmovable force, occupied much of Europe, but the United States was the only atomic power, and the U.S. military boasted the only globe-spanning, high-tech logistical supply chain in the world. By contrast, the Red Army, bound within the Eurasian landmass, transported no less than half of its materials by horse-drawn wagons.  
---

### Few international bankers agreed with these doctrines. As before the Depression, they hoped to be at liberty to place their money and pull it out anywhere they liked, at a whim.  
---

### Back in Britain, before his peers in the House of Lords, Keynes bragged that Bretton Woods ‚Äúaccords to every member government the explicit right to control all capital movements. What used to be a heresy is now endorsed as orthodox.‚Äù Across the Atlantic, a Wall Street banker invoked the legacy of Nazi capital controls and complained of the new ‚ÄúHitlerian monetary system.‚Äù  
---

### Such ‚Äúpeak‚Äù business lobbies, as political scientists call them, very rarely just dictate legislative possibilities, but this time they did.24 To them, what was at issue was their own power to make investment decisions, as well as the long American political-economic tradition of sphering. The arena of private capital investment, in their view, should remain free of state encroachment, and state control over investment was nothing short of Soviet Communism.  
---

### Nonetheless, postwar consumerism was a break from the past in important respects.  
---

### As one French critic of American consumerism would say, ‚ÄúWhatever happens, and whatever one thinks of the arrogance of the dollar or the multinationals, it is this culture which, the world over, fascinates those very people who suffer most at its hands, and it does so through the deep, insane conviction that it has made all their dreams come true.‚Äù22 American consumerism was a utopian project no less audacious than Soviet Communism. That was why the shopping centers ticked, and why, in the twenty-first century, online shoppers click.

### During the so-called golden age of capitalism, big government, for all its power at home and abroad‚Äîand it did sit on a nuclear arsenal capable of ending all civilization‚Äînonetheless enjoyed a rather weak mandate to act in the name of the public interest when moving outside the orbits of either national security

### The many fault lines of the Age of Control set off a series of shocks‚Äîa very 1970s term, when there was ‚Äúfuture shock,‚Äù the ‚ÄúNixon shock,‚Äù ‚Äúoil shocks,‚Äù and finally the ‚ÄúVolcker Shock‚Äù in monetary policy‚Äîthat brought the decade to an end. The total transformation would be tectonic.  
---

### Postwar industrial society had had its virtues‚Äîstructure, stability, and the channeling of income growth to the middle of the distribution. Yet premised as it was on the white male heterosexual breadwinning wage, on social conformism, on an energy regime capable of threatening the planet‚Äôs future, and on dangerous, at times stultifying factory work, regret over its death was and is unwarranted. After all, Matta-Clark made his sculptural ‚Äúcuts‚Äù at industrial and suburban structures in order to let in the light.  
---

### State interventions would only be self-defeating anyway, as individuals took them into account, being rational agents. There was nothing in the world except individual choice and the logical precision of mathematical rigor. With its emphasis on stripped-down individual choice, the economic thought of the 1970s, later branded ‚Äúneoliberal ideology,‚Äù was really just ‚ÄúMe Decade‚Äù economics.  
---

### a difficulty in characterizing, let alone naming, this new capitalism is one of its distinctive features. Perhaps it is ‚Äúpostindustrial‚Äù or ‚Äúpost-Fordist,‚Äù but those labels say what it is not, as opposed to what it is. Is it a ‚ÄúSecond Gilded Age,‚Äù or a period of ‚Äúneoliberalism,‚Äù in some sense a mere repetition of the late nineteenth century? Surely aspects of this capitalism, like its pattern of inequality and its dependence on debt, resonate with past eras.  
---

### Not since after World War I, when, in the context of postwar inflation, the victorious Allies made the decision to return their currencies to the gold standard, had state power so overtly enforced the scarcity value of money capital in an attempt to attack inflation.  
---

### If managers resisted, the buyout would be ‚Äúhostile.‚Äù To raise cash for the purchase of the shares, buyers secured credit lines from banks, or issued junk bonds‚Äîrisky corporate bonds paying high yields. This was the final ingredient: the newly burgeoning debt market in junk bonds. They were what made the buyout leveraged.  
---

### by the mid-1980s a new ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù of what a corporation was had taken shape.77 In 1976 two Chicago-trained University of Rochester business school professors, Michael Jensen and William Meckling, had published what was to be one of the most widely cited of all academic economics papers, ‚ÄúTheory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Ownership Structure.‚Äù78 A firm, they argued, was a spot market, a ‚Äúnexus of contracts.‚Äù The most important contract was that between a principal

### The blurring of appearance and reality was a great preoccupation of 1980s cultural ‚Äúpostmodernism.‚Äù86 Take what might be considered one of the great postmodern literary genres, ‚Äúmark-to-market‚Äù accounting.87 Postwar managerialism‚Äôs ‚Äúhistorical cost‚Äù accounting had computed profit in relation to the past use of productive capital, or its long-term depreciation. In mark-to-market accounting, the present market value of assets, foretelling future incomes, is what matters. The horizon is perpetually short-term. Future ‚Äúreturn on equity,‚Äù or the trajectory of the stock, replaces ‚Äúreturn on investment,‚Äù or the return on the company‚Äôs past outlay of resources, in order to produce something and sell it above its cost of production. The distant past is wiped out. So is the distant future, as the future collapses into the present price of an asset, updated by the millisecond.  
---

### In 1985 Reagan backed down and signed an expanded farm bill that distributed 80 percent of its welfare to overwhelmingly white farm proprietors or corporations that earned more than $100,000 a year. The white yeoman Jeffersonian farmer was no less mythical than the black welfare queen.  
---

### Why worry about stability, structure, or sphering? The great keyword of the decade, globalization, expressed the sentiment best. Goods and culture flowed across borders. To a lesser extent, people did, too‚Äîlegal and illegal immigrants.8 Above all, globalization meant letting capital rove, embracing change. It would all work out to the benefit of everyone somehow.  
---

### The microprocessor was at the heart of the digital electronics revolution. It was a ‚Äúgeneral purpose technology,‚Äù as economists call it, meaning it could be put to use in a variety of ways, like the steam engine in the first industrial revolution.

### 2000, Cisco received $40 million a day in online orders. Sixty percent of them were automated by the website. Cisco then subcontracted the vast majority of production to an ever-shifting, low-wage ‚Äúglobal supply chain.‚Äù The company formally employed 34,000 people  
---

### Quite strict immigration restrictions remained. But what did globalized labor markets often look like? Picture a Filipino nanny raising the child of a highly educated female Silicon Valley executive. That executive earns less money to perform the same task as her male peers at a start-up funded by a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. She also employs a Mexican gardener, who wires money back home on a computer assembled in a Mexican maquiladora, from parts manufactured in a Taiwanese free trade zone.  
---

### new forms of private ‚Äúglobal governance‚Äù emerged, in lieu of state regulation, whether arbitration agreements among multinational corporations, or entities such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association

### The global liquidity glut funded Wall Street speculation in U.S. residential mortgages, and a host of related financial derivatives, such as mortgage-backed securities, all somehow bets or counterbets on whether American residential housing prices would rise in the future.

### Skilling‚Äôs Enron created new liquid markets to trade energy, including ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù energy derivatives‚Äîtradable constructs of data that allowed traders to bet on various movements in prices in markets, or even combinations of movements.  
---

### Still, these companies, racing to the top of corporate valuations, employed fewer people and stimulated surrounding businesses less than high-valued firms had done in previous eras. They had smaller footprints, compared to, say, General Motors in the 1950s. In 2010, 79.5 percent of all high-tech jobs were in the hundred largest metro areas.29 Not surprisingly, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle did well. So did, say, Austin, Texas, and Rochester, New York, specializing in optical technology, or Dayton, Ohio, with its research cluster in radio frequency identification.  
---

### Unlike Wal-Mart in the 1990s, Amazon in the 2000s was not responsible for lowering retail prices‚Äîthat new economy effect, cheaper goods, now trailed off. Amazon most benefited ‚Äúbusy, high earning households.‚Äù30 For these high-earnings households, increasingly, were two-income households, with less time for shopping. Amazon offered not lower prices so much as time savings. Because of Amazon, at the opening of the twenty-first century, the average well-off American consumer could, lying in bed, order with a click on the laptop or a swipe on the phone, various products from around the world and reasonably expect their rapid arrival on their doorstep in two days. But Amazon‚Äôs rise to market dominance through below-cost pricing meant it began to acquire the power to prevent market competition‚Äîas well as place demands on its suppliers. Further, when profits arrived at Amazon, they would come not from consumer retail but rather from Amazon Web Services, which offered data storage and ‚Äúcloud‚Äù computing for businesses.  
---

### Amazon made many fixed investments in its logistics and delivery networks, which better facilitated commerce‚Äîlike investments in canals and railroads more than a century ago. But productivity growth in general disappointed because few potentially productivity-enhancing innovations appeared, given the overriding emphasis on finding ways to gather and use data to predict or even modify consumer behavior.  
---

### In the cities, elites self-removed by marrying only each other or finding common cultural tastes with respect to, say, cuisine. Political polarization surged in tandem.53 Even estimations of human worth sharpened. Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs warped conception was that ‚Äúsomeone who is exceptional in their role is not just a little better than someone who is pretty good. They are 100 times better.‚Äù54 So corporations should hire only the exceptionally talented‚Äîand pay them well, due to their ‚Äúhuman capital‚Äù‚Äînot the born losers.  
---

### Banks sold the tranches in over-the-counter markets to investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, and university endowments. Or they held on to them as their own investments. In 2004 banks‚Äô ‚Äúprivate label‚Äù securitization surged past Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had long offered government subsidies to the mortgage market. With confidence in risk management due to MBS diversification high, banks believed they could profitably offer loans to riskier, subprime borrowers. Between 2003 and 2007, there was $4 trillion in new MBSs.  
---

### Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fearful of having lost 20 percent of market share between 2003 and 2006, tried to win it back. They ramped up leverage 75 to 1 and also bought riskier loans. Origination standards degraded. In 2006, 27 percent of all new mortgages had no or low documentation proving income, and in the summer the number of mortgages defaulting within months of their issue doubled. In the spring of 2006, residential investment declined, and mortgage defaults began to arrive.  
---

### Lehman was leveraged as high as 40 to 1.1 That meant that for every $40 it borrowed, it had $1 as a cushion in the event that its creditors all suddenly came calling. Every night, as a matter of its business model, Lehman borrowed $200 billion from overnight interbank money markets. When nobody would lend to Lehman anymore, the bank went under.  
---

### Decades of privatization meant that many citizens no longer interacted with the government when exercising their rights as citizens‚Äîthey interacted with nonprofit and for-profit ‚Äúservice providers.‚Äù81 Thus the statement ‚ÄúKeep your government hands off my Medicare!‚Äù actually made some degree of sense.  
---

### Geithner had come of age at Treasury‚Äôs international desk during the 1990s, and to him the Panic of 2007‚Äì8, while grander, was little different from the Mexican currency crisis of 1994 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997‚Äì98. Restore confidence, restore capital markets, honor all private contracts, and presto‚Äîbehold Humpty-Dumpty put back together.  
---

### Whether it was the stress tests or something else‚Äîperhaps the government‚Äôs forced recapitalization of the banks, perhaps finally a waning of fear in the markets‚Äîthe fog of disquietude began to lift. Transactional liquidity among banks began to return. By June 2009, nearly all credit spreads had returned to pre-crisis levels. Most of the banks had begun to redeem TARP funds from the government. The federal government would actually profit from the program. The nearly two-year financial crisis was over. That same month, in‚Ä¶

### Still, as in the Great Depression, the bigger problem was an immediate demand constraint. Spending, whether for investment or for consumption, was simply insufficient to bring about employment-giving enterprise. When many corporations made profits, rather than invest in new capacity, they distributed the profits as dividends, bought back their shares to increase their values, or simply sat on giant piles of hoarded cash. Given their access to nearly free short-term funding, banks returned to profitability by‚Ä¶

### Tellingly, in states hardest hit by the Great Recession, such as Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Nevada, Republicans swept into power. It was undoubtedly a resounding rejection of the Democrats‚Äô handling of the Great Recession, as well as the Democratic Party‚Äôs decades-long contributions to the creation of an economy whose restoration was, so far, mostly benefiting elites.
