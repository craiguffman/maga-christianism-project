### The owners of capital control investment decisions. More than anything, the investment power is what makes capitalists so powerful.

### Capitalism is an economy‚Äîan instrumental means of producing things for consumption‚Äîgeared toward the achievement of capital‚Äôs end, which is pecuniary gain.  
---

### Liquidity and illiquidity are relative qualities, which must get attributed by actors to capital assets. They are not essential properties of them.  
---

### Arguably, there is no more extraordinary instance of economic development on record than the case of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century United States.  
---

### What brought about the end of the Age of Commerce in America was precisely the issue that had initiated it‚Äîa geopolitical struggle over commerce, and over a particular kind. From the seventeenth century, enslaved capital had played a vital role in the extension of capitalist production across North American space. The free labor vision of the North now hoped to forbid its spread. The Republican Party, which arose during the national political crises of the 1850s over the extension of slavery in the West, desired a new political-economic settlement. No one was better at articulating the moral and economic reasons for it than the party‚Äôs candidate for president in the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln said slavery should exist only where it already stood and someday should die out altogether.  
---

### Foremost, mercantilists promoted an understanding of political economy in which there was no categorical separation between state and market. Smith inherited this legacy. But unlike Smith, mercantilists defined national economic prosperity as the existence of a positive ‚Äúbalance of trade‚Äù with other nations. Greater market access and more commerce were the sources of imperial wealth, but only when a nation exported goods of a value greater than it imported, including in relation to its colonies. More coin flowed into the nation‚Äôs coffers at the expense of its geopolitical competitors.  
---

### Like many Whigs, and unlike many of their Tory political opponents, Shaftesbury was among the more enterprising of English lords. He sought to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù his lands and thereby increase their productivity and commercial yields. In that process, land became something more than the property and wealth that sustained gentry class rule. It also became a form of productive capital.

### The Ashley and Cooper rivers bear his name in South Carolina today.

### power, he formed a like-minded circle around him. In 1666, then chancellor of the exchequer, Shaftesbury traveled to Oxford suffering from a liver ailment. A young physician installed a silver tap to his abdomen and likely saved his life. The young physician was also a philosopher, John Locke. Locke joined his new patron‚Äôs household in London, earning his keep as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Locke even invested in the Bahamas projects, and together the two drafted the

### Benjamin Worsley, a Hartlibian before the Restoration and afterward a member of Shaftesbury‚Äôs circle, explained that the state‚Äôs interest in commerce was ‚Äúwidely different from the mercantile part of it.‚Äù22 For it was the duty of the merchant to consider not the public interest but rather only his ‚Äúprivatt profitt.‚Äù Shaftesbury agreed. The state should promote commerce, an ever more critical source of imperial wealth. But the state must also regulate private self-interest so that commerce might lead to a desirable public end.  
---

### In the Atlantic, the Iberian powers had first claimed dominion over the Americas. The English settled Barbados in 1625 in part because Spain neglected it. The English had to fight to gain and keep their Atlantic colonies. At war with Spain, Cromwell sent a fleet to the Caribbean in 1654, with the goal of conquering Hispaniola, but England would settle for the violent colonization of Jamaica.41 In the 1660s and ‚Äô70s, England fought a series of wars against the Dutch, explicitly over global market access.42 In 1664 Charles II dispatched a fleet to conquer New Netherland, which became the New York colony. English colonization in the Atlantic proceeded thus.  
---

### The most incisive mercantilists recognized that money is a dynamic factor in economic development. For in addition to being a medium of transaction, as well as a unit of account, money may also be a form of credit‚Äîand thus a form of pecuniary capital. Credit, at the very nerve center of capitalism, may finance, and thus draw out, more commerce, labor, and wealth-generating enterprise. Increasing returns to economic activity are unlocked.  
---

### In 1685 the Catholic James II ascended to the English throne and attempted to reorganize the North American colonies into something more like his personal dominions. He promulgated more absolutist enforcements of the Navigation Acts. Revolts in New England, New York, and Maryland accompanied the 1688 Glorious Revolution and Parliament‚Äôs invitation of William and Mary of Orange to the English throne.  
---

### The Barbados slave code of 1661, which secured common law property rights in human chattel, and set a legal precedent for other English colonies, was draconian.96 That was putting it nicely. Overseers hung disobedient slaves from trees in iron cages, leaving them to die of thirst as examples to others. By the 1710s, in not too dissimilar fashion, Jamaica‚Äîfirst a hub for English buccaneers‚Äîwas producing more sugar than Barbados.  
---

### Winthrop worried that New England risked commercial collapse. But a Barbados planter wrote to him as early as 1647 requesting ‚Äútrade for provisions for the belly.‚Äù The boom in Barbados sugar production increased the ‚Äúextent of the market,‚Äù as Smith would put it, for New England fish, foodstuffs, timber, and livestock.  
---

### Left alone, commerce would lead to an enlightened commonwealth, Smith argued. Eighteenth-century colonial North America, much more the North than the social disaster that was the early West Indies, began to reflect Smith‚Äôs moral vision. Coffeehouses, libraries, and theaters appeared. Colonial elites rushed to participate in a British Atlantic consumer culture, sustaining, in good mercantilist fashion, considerable consumer markets for English manufacturers. By the 1750s, North America was the fastest-growing destination for British goods.125 Commercial refinement became a marker of status.  
---

### Already by 1300, no more than 10 percent of England was still forested. The seventeenth-century poet Henry Vaughan began his poem ‚ÄúThe Timber‚Äù declaring ‚ÄúSure thou didst flourish once!‚Äù10 But then the climate cooled, inaugurating what archeologists call a five-hundred-year ‚ÄúLittle Ice Age.‚Äù Between the Great Famine  
---

### The ‚Äúhousehold sector,‚Äù as it is known today‚Äîwith much of it not counted in contemporary calculations of a national economy‚Äôs gross domestic product  
---

### Thus, Locke wrote, the ‚Äúwild Indian‚Äù who shoots a deer in ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù is entitled to its carcass and meat but not to the forest in which he killed it. That would require a conscious effort to clear, cultivate, and fence the land. The improvement that thus resulted excluded ‚Äúthe common right of other Men.‚Äù  
---

### Within the category of master and servant, there were two more subsets, in addition to indenture. One was wage work. Wages in America were by comparison with England high, but ‚Äúhirling‚Äù was still a dependent legal status. Hirlings could not legally quit before ending their term of service. If they did, they could not claim wages for past services rendered. In these important respects, wage labor was not yet ‚Äúfree labor,‚Äù in the later sense of the term.  
---

### The peasant desired landed property‚Äîpolitical security of title, a home for the household, and noncommercial access to life‚Äôs basic economic necessities. For the peasant, landed property, as wealth, secured a certain standard of living, but it was also something more than capital.  
---

### Jefferson objected. As secretary of state, he desired for the United States to break free, immediately, from all commercial dependence on the mercantilist British Empire. By opening up its ports to all nations, the U.S. republic would become a beacon of ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù to the world. Meanwhile, if Hamilton‚Äôs sympathies were with urban, commercial elites, Jefferson‚Äôs were with rural white heads of household, even with lesser yeomen. Hamilton looked east to the British model of long-term economic development. Jefferson looked west, eyeing the continental interior. The republic‚Äôs long-term future, in his view, lay in more settler colonialism, including the slave-based variety. Not the economic development of finance, commerce, and manufactures in unison but widespread white male property ownership should be the aim of republican political economy.  
---

### As for the federal government‚Äôs ‚Äúassumption‚Äù of the state debts, Madison believed Virginia, less in debt than other states, would pay more than its fair share under Hamilton‚Äôs scheme. Madison had the votes in Congress to block the measure, and he did.  
---

### One more aspect of Hamilton‚Äôs economic worldview deserves mention. Born low, illegitimately, and an immigrant, he was a self-made elitist. The new federal government, on the make as well, was ripe for his ambition. Hamilton was a revolutionary and a republican, but he believed in government of the wise, the rich, and the good. He was no friend to democracy. ‚ÄúThe people,‚Äù he announced to the Constitutional Convention, ‚Äúare turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.‚Äù41  
---

### Hamilton was not finished yet. Months later, in December 1790, he released his ‚ÄúReport on a National Bank,‚Äù proposing a twenty-year federal corporate charter for a Bank of the United States  
---

### After the Revolution, there was a flurry of state-level chartering of joint-stock corporations, all profit seeking, but each with a stated ‚Äúpublic purpose‚Äù‚Äîmarine insurance corporations, turnpike corporations, but also some banking corporations.46 To critics, corporations were unrepublican, smacking of monarchical privilege and monopoly. Some did not want corporations chartered at even the state level.47 Secretary of State Jefferson and Congressman Madison made constitutional objections to Hamilton‚Äôs BUS, arguing that the federal chartering of corporations was not implicit in the Constitution‚Äôs ‚Äúnecessary and proper clause.‚Äù Hamilton made quick work of the Virginians‚Äô legal arguments. The charter passed, and the BUS opened its book for subscriptions on July 4, 1791. Within an hour, there was no more stock left to sell.  
---

### Republicans believed in a system of political representation. For this reason, in politics the American revolutionary leadership was obsessed with personal ‚Äúvirtue.‚Äù Republican leaders must act ‚Äúdisinterestedly,‚Äù on behalf of the common good. Politics should not be a venue for self-interested ambition, as that would lead to ‚Äúcorruption.‚Äù If a political representative were not ‚Äúindependent,‚Äù if he did not own sufficient property, his ‚Äúdependence‚Äù would make him corruptible and unfit for republican rule. Hamilton would have agreed with all this. But Jefferson went further. Not only republican leaders but also republican citizens must be ‚Äúvirtuous‚Äù and ‚Äúindependent.‚Äù For that, they had to own a particular kind of property and wealth. Not financial ‚Äúscrip,‚Äù which represented the whims of finance and therefore the risk of dependency. Republican citizens should really own land.  
---

### Jefferson was no simple yeoman. He enslaved black people and exploited them physically, sexually, and emotionally. His own republican ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù hardly rated. Hamilton called him a ‚Äúcontemptible hypocrite,‚Äù and contemptible or not, at minimum Jefferson was a hypocrite.55 Instead of ‚Äúcharacter,‚Äù he had, in the modern sense of the term, ‚Äúpersonality,‚Äù which is why he continues to fascinate us today‚Äîwhereas Washington, if more admirable, can come across as boring. Jefferson was truly conflicted about nearly everything in his life. He hated cities but loved Paris. He celebrated commercial independence but died under a mountain of debt. Probably he thought he was in love with one of his slaves.  
---

### Tensions emerged between the two future blocs at the opening of first Congress, when Congressman Madison proposed a Navigation Law against British imports‚Äînearly a prohibitive ban. Wrongly, Madison believed the loss of the U.S. market would bring the British Empire to the negotiating table. But Jefferson agreed with him. Hamilton‚Äôs Treasury reports are justly celebrated, but few read Secretary of State Jefferson‚Äôs no less thorough ‚ÄúReport on the Privileges and Restrictions on the Commerce of the United States in Foreign Countries‚Äù  
---

### Hamilton could not abide a steep tariff against British imports, for 77 percent of U.S. imports were then British.66 His proposed moderate duty was meant not to discourage British imports but rather to raise the fiscal revenue needed to fund assumption, and thus the permanent national debt, and therefore the entire Hamiltonian developmental project.  
---

### The Virginians saw a political opportunity to expand Jefferson‚Äôs white yeoman ideology to encompass northern mechanics and even tradesmen who could not locate a scheduled federal Treasury auction. In 1792 Madison wrote an anonymous newspaper article accusing Hamilton of being ‚Äúmore partial to the opulent than to the other classes of society‚Äù and of believing that ‚Äúmankind are incapable of governing themselves.‚Äù70 By the end of that year, Jefferson‚Äôs ‚Äúrepublican interest,‚Äù or the Republicans, was publicly squaring off against ‚Äúthe Treasury‚Äù of Hamilton, or the Federalists.  
---

### the immediate cause of the 1790s boom was the French revolutionary wars and the Atlantic commercial opportunities they made possible. Europeans demanded U.S. foodstuffs, which meant prosperity for the grain-growing mid-Atlantic states, as well as for U.S. shipping interests, which benefited the northeastern urban ports. While southern planters did not benefit so much, they found a new export staple‚Äîcotton.  
---

### But the most active and hostile agents west of the Appalachians were neither European empires nor Indian nations. They were American colonizers. Some flirted with separation from the United States, but these men‚Äîwhite yeomen heads of household‚Äîwere Jefferson‚Äôs constituents. In 1780, the same year he announced the Empire of Liberty, Jefferson noted of the West that the national government could not hope to control colonization there. It was ‚Äúnecessary to give way to the torrent.‚Äù  
---

### In declaring war, Madison had accused the British of rousing Indian ‚Äúsavages‚Äù in the West.113 A composite British imperial geography, which had granted Native nations some room to maneuver, including commercially, gave way to something different.114 The Empire of Liberty was not the same as European empires in this respect: it was less respectful of Indian sovereignty. It did not want to trade so much as to conquer. Popular violence was let loose against Indian peoples.  
---

### Gravitating to his dark horse candidacy were supporters of the national war hero, as well as squatters and speculators who eyed Indian and western lands. He also attracted elites who did not support Clay‚Äôs American System‚Äîchiefly slaveholders who feared expansive federal governmental power and hated the tariff that taxed their consumption of British goods.44 They wanted ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù and saw nothing wrong with the post-1815 cotton boom except for its bust.  
---

### Finally, another constituency projected its views onto General Jackson, a group that shared in common a sense of grievance against cosmopolitan national elites, which Clay, Calhoun, and Adams undoubtedly were.46 With roots in the Jeffersonian mobilization, the enduring, emotionally pitched American populist tradition first appeared.  
---

### The Missouri-based Bingham, a political Whig, offered this explanation of his painting: ‚ÄúThe Squatters as a class, are not fond of the toil of agriculture, but erect their rude cabins upon those remote portions of the national domain, when the abundant game supplies their phisical [sic] wants. When this source of subsistence becomes diminished in consequence of increasing settlements around they usually sell out their slight improvement, with their ‚Äòpreemption title‚Äô to the land, and again follow the receding footsteps of the Savage.‚Äù  
---

### At the same time, Biddle curried government favor. He used BUS funds to support the campaigns of politicians friendly to the bank. He made loans to editors of important newspapers. He granted loans to congressmen, on poor security, that sometimes went unpaid. He kept Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster, for instance, on a permanent legal retainer. Once, Webster wrote to Biddle, ‚Äúmy retainer has not been renewed, or refreshed, as usual. If it be wished that my relation to the Bank be continued, it may be well to send me the usual retainer.‚Äù59 Should such an arrangement appear ‚Äúcorrupt,‚Äù it is because one is looking at it through the eyes of the Jacksonian Democracy. Biddle, Webster, and Clay saw nothing wrong with the BUS simultaneously benefiting both the public good and their private bottom lines, at once. That was the essence of political economy.  
---

### The same Lewis Tappan of the mercantile credit agency hired out the chapel to Charles Finney, the most popular evangelical preacher of the day, in the ongoing Second Great Awakening. Finney himself was something of a showman. He said your soul‚Äôs salvation was your own responsibility. You, not God, had to decide if you wanted to be saved, trusting in your own will‚Äîa stark departure from the Calvinist orthodoxy of Puritan New England, which insisted that only God was truth, only God was real, only God knew and could be trusted to know the true state of your soul, including whether you would go to heaven after the final day of reckoning. Finney announced that you got to choose whether you were saved.  
---

### In the American political tradition, the Jeffersonian idiom was critical less of the market than of dependence on particular markets, whether stock markets or public debt markets. After all, Jefferson was a utopian about the geopolitical possibilities of ‚Äúfree trade.‚Äù Jeffersonian republicanism had translated into a Jacksonian democratic rhetoric that was even more suspicious of privilege and oligarchy. Nevertheless, a large Jacksonian constituency was mostly critical of monopoly and positively yearned for equality of commercial opportunity.  
---

### In Walden‚Äôs scathing first chapter, ‚ÄúEconomy,‚Äù Thoreau addressed Concord‚Äôs farmers. But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool‚Äôs life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.  
---

### Thoreau did not believe in the commercializing farmer‚Äôs limitless quest for more and more. Specialization and the division of labor, rather than increasing the wealth of nations, turned everyone into but ‚Äúthe ninth part of a man.‚Äù37 The accusation gets to the heart of ‚Äútranscendentalism.‚Äù Thomas Jefferson had celebrated the republican virtue of independence, premised on the private ownership and control of landed property, wealth, and capital. Land had to be owned, and worked, for the feeling of independence to come about. For Thoreau, no private property outside one‚Äôs own being could adequately ground independence and autonomy.  
---

### Furthermore, human beings are not self-sufficient, or at least stoic independence is a weak premise for true friendship. We are friends with one another because, as human beings, we are dependent on one another. Thoreau, hoarding his confidence, is lampooned in The Confidence-Man as an ethical miser. A world without ‚Äúconfidence,‚Äù Melville wrote, was both ‚Äúsolitary‚Äù and ‚Äúdehumanized.‚Äù  
---

### While in the abstract a pecuniary process of investment defines capitalism, at a more concrete level there are different possible capitalisms, in which capitalists, and the communities in which they live, may prioritize investing in different forms of capital.  
---

### In the Age of Commerce, the cotton trade revealed the extent to which the American South remained dependent for demand on the British Empire, which had already carried out slave emancipation.6 Meanwhile in the composite order of the Empire of Liberty, slavery existed in Louisiana but‚Ä¶

### First, in a departure from common eighteenth-century beliefs that equated enslavement with attempted animalization, paternalism professed to acknowledge the ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù of enslaved blacks but nonetheless still considered them racially inferior. ‚ÄúOur slaves,‚Äù insisted James Henley Thornwell, an important professor of theology in Columbia, South Carolina, ‚Äúare moral beings.‚Äù45 Unlike many masters before, paternalists welcomed the religious conversion of their slaves to Christianity. They rejected the patriarchal slaveholding ideology‚Äîthe harsh, distant rule of the father over his subjects‚Äîof colonial North America and instead promoted the ‚ÄúAbrahamic‚Äù kind, in which master-slave relations should be more intimate and affective. God‚Äôs law checked the master‚Äôs dominion.  
---

### Second, paternalism cast southern home life in the Victorian moral light of domestic sentiment. Black slaves were not just members of households, or economic units. They were members of families, emotionally speaking. William A. Smith, president of Randolph-Macon College, captured the essential idea in his Lectures on the Philosophy and Practice of Slavery  
---

### In 1860, with cotton prices soaring, only on plantations with fifteen or more slaves did cotton account for more than 50‚Ä¶  
---

### paternalists lapped up the same transatlantic, romantic critique of commerce as did Emerson and Thoreau but spun something different of it.55 Here, among the slave master‚Äôs newly fashioned ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù Christian duties and burdens, none was more publicly celebrated than the need to provide for slaves‚Äô basic subsistence‚Äîapart from commerce. In paternalist ideology, the moral split between heartless commerce and domestic familial affection became sharp. Thus a particular economic logic of investment, given that slaves represented running and fixed costs, led to a large plantation household subsistence sector,‚Ä¶

### Paternalism, which seemed to evoke precapitalist tradition if not bygone feudalism, was in truth an invented tradition of late-antebellum slave capitalism. It was one more crack at the same old problem of the Age of Commerce: how might commerce be‚Ä¶

### In 1837 John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, indicating the shift, championed the new pro-slavery ideology from the floor of the U.S. Senate. Not widespread landownership but black slavery and white racial solidarity, he bellowed, was ‚Äúthe‚Ä¶

### Lincoln was unusually tall, a gangly six foot four inches, with oversize ears, gray eyes, and a high-pitched squeaky voice. In the courtroom he had honed an engaging and folksy speaking style. People who knew him well commented on his ambition. He had not been a leading early architect of the Republican Party, but he was an eloquent spokesman for free labor, saying, ‚ÄúFree labor has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope.‚Äù He saw no fundamental conflict between ‚Äúcapital‚Äù and ‚Äúlabor,‚Äù as wage laborers could someday become property-owning producers.137 Greater access to ‚Äúeducation,‚Äù he added, was key.  
---

### ‚ÄúA house,‚Äù Lincoln declared when he had announced for the Senate, ‚Äúdivided against itself cannot stand.‚Äù The United States could not ‚Äúendure, permanently half slave and half free.‚Äù  
---

### Douglas won reelection to the Senate in 1858, sweeping downstate corn-and-hog Illinois. Tellingly, however, Lincoln carried the northern counties, the city of Chicago, and the Illinois wheat belt. Nevertheless, the Lincoln-Douglas debates made Lincoln a national political figure and while he was a dark horse candidate, in 1860 he would go on to win the Republican Party‚Äôs nomination for president. He learned of his nomination while sitting in his parlor in his home in Springfield. The house, fenced off from the public street, did not have a street-facing front porch. Lincoln had removed it in an 1855 home renovation.  
---

### Slave capital was valuable precisely because it was portable. The South still had plenty of land available for cultivation, but rationally or not, southerners now hitched their economic expectations to the continued geographic spread of slavery. As a Georgia congressman put it bluntly on the House floor in 1856, ‚ÄúThere is not a slaveholder in the House or out of it, but who knows perfectly well that, whenever slavery is confined within certain specified limits its existence is doomed.‚Äù147 Lincoln agreed. No wonder that after his election, southern capital markets priced a different future expectation, and slave asset prices declined by a third.  
---

### **Tags:** #orange - The Jeffersonian Empire of Liberty was no more. Slavery was abolished. The federal government asserted a more robust and uniform sovereignty, devolving relatively less rule than it had before to households, corporations, the individual states, and Indian sovereigns. Instead, government offered inducements for private industrial development. It granted subsidies to railroad corporations‚Äîno longer subsovereigns of the Empire of Liberty, and more fully private, for-profit actors that, soon enough, had constitutionally protected rights as property owners.  
---

### Populists attacked the gold standard‚Äîto which the United States had returned following the Civil War‚Äîfor restricting the money and credit supply and for contributing to a grinding era of commodity price deflation. They attacked large, democratically unaccountable, and monopolistic railroad and banking corporations. Raising the Jacksonian banner of antimonopoly and equal commercial opportunity, Populists arrayed the interests of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù against those of industrial and financial elites.

### Congress passed two Pacific Railway Acts, in 1862 and 1864. The former created the first federally chartered corporation since the Second Bank of the United States, the Union Pacific, which built westward from Lincoln‚Äôs chosen starting point of Omaha, Nebraska. Meanwhile the Central Pacific, a California-chartered corporation, approached from the west.  
---

### In 1861 President Lincoln appointed Thomas A. Scott, the brilliant superintendent and vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, to serve as assistant secretary of war.24 Scott worked under Secretary of War Simon Cameron, a friend of Scott‚Äôs and the most corrupt government official in the Union. Scott did not even resign his post at the Penn Railroad when he went to Washington. He could set the terms, because the Union was in dire need of his expertise.

### Greenbacks began to trade against gold at a discount‚Äîthe ‚Äúgold premium‚Äù‚Äîand a gold market, formally organized as the New York Gold Exchange in October 1864, took shape. Paper money depreciated: while $1.00 in gold traded at $1.30 in paper in 1862, it traded at $2.33 in 1864. But the gold premium was volatile, depending on future expectations of the Union‚Äôs military‚Ä¶

### In the congressional elections of 1866, President Johnson campaigned against Radical Republicans, at loggerheads over the South. Radical Republicans, promising to make good on the Civil War, swept the Congress, taking the reins of Reconstruction during the onset of the deflationary slump. Before ex‚ÄìConfederate States could reenter the Union, the new Congress demanded passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which enshrined the Civil Rights Act of 1866 into the Constitution. Congress divided the South into five districts of northern military‚Ä¶

### Between 1868 and 1873, railroad corporations constructed 24,589 miles of new rail, more than half in the trans-Mississippi West and the Far West.116 In Smithian fashion, the railroads increased the extent of markets and the demand for goods across an expanding continental marketplace.  
---

### The Adams brothers wrote of Vanderbilt: [He] has combined the natural power of the individual with the factitious power of the corporation. The famous ‚ÄúL‚Äôetat, c‚Äôest moi‚Äù of Louis XIV represents Vanderbilt‚Äôs position in regard to his railroads. Unconsciously he has introduced Caesarism into corporate life. He has, however, but pointed out the way which others will tread‚Ä¶.Vanderbilt is but the precursor of a class of men who will wield within the state a power created by the State, but too great for its control.  
---

### The Democracy had called for an end to corrupt ‚Äúspecial privilege,‚Äù but something had gone wrong. Economically, given the reality of increasing returns to economic scale in railroading, the risk that first movers would capture a monopolistic share of the market loomed. Now powerful men, who competed over the buying of judges and legislators, were cynically manipulating the Jacksonian cry for equality of commercial opportunity to acquire such advantages politically, too.  
---

### Carnegie, at thirty-three, was weighed down by a guilty conscience. ‚ÄúMan must have an idol,‚Äù he wrote to himself. But ‚Äúthe amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money.‚Äù8 Conflicted, he ceased his financial speculations.  
---

### Carnegie applied product cost accounting to steelmaking. He once told his men: Show me your cost sheets. It is more interesting to know how cheaply and how well you have done this thing than how much money you have made, because the one is a temporary result, due possibly to special conditions of trade, but the other means a permanency that will go on with the works as long as they last.15 ‚ÄúCarnegie never wanted to know the profits,‚Äù his own prot√©g√©, Charles M. Schwab, recalled. ‚ÄúHe always wanted to know the cost.‚Äù  
---

### Meanwhile Carnegie increased the scale of his operations. ‚ÄúCheapness is in proportion to the scale of production,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo make ten tons of steel a day would cost many time[s] as much per ton as to make one hundred tons. Thus the larger the scale of operation the cheaper the product.‚Äù18 Larger scale demanded greater bureaucratic coordination from start to finish and the ‚Äúvertical integration‚Äù of production. Carnegie himself could help sell the final product in final markets.  
---

### A final issue to consider is the functioning of a new industrial investment multiplier, which now complemented the Smithian commercial multiplier, in the achievement of increasing returns to economic activity. A farmer might harvest wheat and, selling it in a competitive market, earn a higher money income, but that would be the end of it. By contrast, Carnegie manufactured steel. Steel, an ‚Äúintermediate,‚Äù or ‚Äúcapital good,‚Äù multiplied a whole series of backward and forward linkages, fostering downstream demand for coal and coke, as well as for the components of his factories, while supplying, upstream, goods for railroad corporations or the construction industry.25 Due to Carnegie‚Äôs achievements, firms began to expect these activities to be profitable in the future, and so they were called forth in the present. Production in general expanded. Carnegie‚Äôs singular drive to manufacture steel thus helped catalyze a larger, cumulative process of industrialization.

### Dead plants and animals decay in oxygen-poor environments, and after thousands of years a spongy biomass forms, called peat. Gravity, and heat from the earth‚Äôs core, removes water and gases from peat, leaving behind high concentrations of carbon. After millions of years, peat bogs become coal. The more water and gases are removed from the peat, the higher the carbon concentration. Peat becomes lignite, then subbituminous, then bituminous coal. Pressure from the movement of tectonic plates produces anthracite coal, which is almost pure carbon. It burns longer, hotter, and cleaner than any other coal.

### The point could be taken too far. Subsistence economies persisted, whether among white farm households in Appalachia‚Äîcenturies of successive commodity booms had passed over them‚Äîor Hispanic villages in the Southwest, which mixed commerce and subsistence not far from corporate railroad and mining camps.

### In 1892 alone state militias intervened to put down strikes on twenty-three separate occasions.12 The Homestead strike followed nearly two decades of labor strife, which had begun, no less dramatically, in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873 with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.  
---

### New industrial cities were the chief arenas of conflict, and municipal authorities struggled to contain the violence.14 In Pittsburgh, a crowd of workers and sympathizers, many women and children, blockaded the Pennsylvania Railroad‚Äôs freight yard. The Pittsburgh police, in solidarity with the strikers, would not act. State militiamen arrived, bayoneted a few protesters, and fired on the crowd, killing twenty. Angry mobs, in the thousands, chased the six hundred militiamen into a roundhouse, where they barricaded themselves, clinging to a Gatling gun. The mob destroyed more than two thousand railcars, one hundred locomotives, and nearly forty buildings, and they tore up the tracks of a three-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

### Increasingly, unskilled operatives in factories were European immigrants, whose preference was for long hours of work and the highest possible wage, regardless of working conditions, because their aspiration was not to own and operate their own businesses, as proprietors, but rather to return to Europe with money in their pockets.34 Their outlook and preferences disrupted U.S. labor-organizing efforts. The immigrant return rate was 10 percent in the 1870s, but it would approach 70 percent in the early twentieth century.

### After a harvest, farmers were forced to accept a competitive world market price for their crops. Farmers in this era grew wealthier in absolute terms. But relatively, industry captured a larger share of the newfound productivity gains, due to increasing returns in commerce and manufacturing.17 While many farmers were in debt, the great railroad corporations, which farmers depended on to take their crops to market‚Äîand which set prices for their customers based on their own costs rather than being forced to take a competitive market price, as farmers were‚Äîgrew rich. Bankers, who controlled farmers‚Äô access to credit, increased their own incomes.  
---

### The railroad corporations contributed to the farmers‚Äô troubles. The Farmers‚Äô Alliance charged the railroads with discriminating against small, rural customers, a violation of property owners‚Äô equality of commercial opportunity. The antimonopoly charge evoked Jacksonian Democracy but also the post‚ÄìCivil War Granger movement. Granger laws, which had passed in many midwestern states, forbade railroad rate discrimination.

### Taking up the Populist cause, although more in cities than in the West, Progressives transformed the concept of ‚Äúnatural monopoly‚Äù into the associated notion of a ‚Äúpublic utility‚Äù corporation. 90 In 1905‚Äì7 they largely lost the battle for municipal ownership of streetcars and subways, but the capital of privately owned ‚Äúutilities‚Äù‚Äîthe municipal infrastructure of transportation, gas, waterworks, and sewage‚Äîbecame newly affected with the ‚Äúpublic interest.‚Äù

### Henry Ford was many things. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to see that no man comes to know me,‚Äù he once jotted in an introspective note to himself.7 He was an eccentric, surely, but also a pacifist and a suffragist. For health reasons, he attacked the pasteurization of milk. He was an anti-Semite, publisher of The International Jew

### Profit was far too narrow an aim for Ford‚Äôs massive, homespun ego. A far more grandiose motivation fired his extraordinary dedication to investing in mass production. He was not conflicted about short-term speculation versus long-term investment‚Äîlet alone hoarding. He associated short-term profit making in liquid financial markets with the ‚ÄúInternational Jew‚Äù and never participated in it,

### This type of worker, like a good soldier, stood at an assembly line. In return for his obedience and consent, he earned a breadwinning wage‚Äîafter work, he could buy the new consumer goods of the Machine Age.  
---

### Basically, to keep the line moving, Ford bought off his workforce. He preempted the AFL‚Äôs politics of pay with his own brand of income politics. Unlike Carnegie, he would hand over a portion of his expanding profits. To great public fanfare, he announced the five-dollar day on January 5, 1914. Work was reduced from nine hours a day to eight. Daily pay for unskilled workers doubled from $2.50 to $5. Job application lines quickly ran out the door of the Ford employment department, and by 1915 labor turnover was down to 16 percent.58  
---

### another line of thought, Ford realized that if he did not pay his workers high enough wages, they would not be able to afford to buy his cars. That Ford was manufacturing a consumer good as opposed to an intermediate capital good was of great significance. Mass production would usher in an era of mass consumption, in which consumerism joined commerce and industrial investment among dynamic economic factors.  
---

### Ford objected. ‚ÄúThe primary object of a manufacturing business,‚Äù he would declare in My Life and Work, was not to make a pecuniary profit for the company‚Äôs owners but ‚Äúto produce.‚Äù69 That was Ford‚Äôs politics of capital.

### Hoover believed his ‚Äúassociational state‚Äù transcended the Jacksonian sphering of public and private, state and market, which, under the banner of equal commercial opportunity, had withered state action throughout the Age of Capital. But he drew one line in the sand: he would not coerce capitalists to invest.

### Hoover further implored private nonprofit corporations to provide relief to the growing ranks of the unemployed. With capital failing, perhaps philanthropic wealth could fill the breach. The Rockefellers kicked in $1 million in New York. When Henry Ford was approached in Detroit, he refused, with the bizarre response, ‚ÄúEndowment is an opiate of the imagination, a drug to initiative.‚Äù

### Economic output fell 52 percent. Farm prices declined by a staggering 65 percent. U.S. corporations, profiting by $10 billion in 1929, suffered losses of $3 billion in 1932. The Dow stock index for the NYSE hit 41, a total loss of 90 percent since the 1929 peak. No fewer than 600,000 homeowners defaulted on mortgages, and $7 billion in deposits were lost. Fortune estimated that 34 million Americans‚Äîout of a population of 120 million‚Äîhad no money income on which to live.

In July 1932, most dramatically, 25,000 unemployed World War I veterans marched on Washington, pleading with the federal government to pay them the bonuses they said the government owed them for military service. The ‚ÄúBonus Army‚Äù camped out across the Potomac River in Anacostia, Virginia. General Douglas MacArthur sent in tanks and bayonets, and the Bonus Army disintegrated.

### But one of the candidate‚Äôs great political assets was his ideological flexibility. Unlike Hoover, he was not a technocrat. Nor was he an intellectual; hence he was free from the problem that plagues most intellectuals in politics, their almost aesthetic desire for a grand ideological system, in which all the different parts must fit together into a unified whole. When asked during the campaign what his ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù was, FDR responded, ‚ÄúPhilosophy? Philosophy? I am a Christian and a Democrat‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Frankfurter cut his teeth on Progressive public utility regulation and was generally inimical to Wall Street. Many of Frankfurter‚Äôs ‚Äúboys‚Äù would swarm New Deal administrative agencies.35 Corcoran had practiced corporate law in New York before becoming an RFC lawyer in 1932.

### The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 would repeg the dollar to gold at $35 an ounce. The devaluation against gold since FDR‚Äôs inauguration was 60 percent. Rather than repegging it for all time, FDR announced that if need be, there would be more adjustment. ‚ÄúI reserve the right,‚Äù he declared, ‚Äúto alter this proclamation as the interest of the United States may seem to require.‚Äù

### The TVA would expand electric power generation to an impoverished rural region, which private power utilities had deemed unprofitable.

### The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was perhaps the most direct assault against the owners of capital of any piece of New Deal legislation. It was another Frankfurter, Cohen, Corcoran job, working in alliance with southern Democrats, led by Texan Sam Rayburn in the House. When he was governor of New York, FDR had been an advocate of public electric utilities.

### In 1937‚Äì38 came a sharp economic downturn, the so-called ‚Äúrecession within the Depression,‚Äù particularly in the industrial sector. Many New Dealers finally began to make the correct diagnosis: the economic problem had been not overproduction but rather underinvestment and underconsumption. They began to consider using government deficit spending to kick-start private economic initiative through a fiscal multiplier.

### The General Theory had yet to make an impact as a book, but Keynes‚Äôs ideas were in circulation.149 And he clearly saw the political bind posed by his theory. He attributed the 1937‚Äì38 recession to a ‚Äúpeculiar kind of new crisis of confidence,‚Äù leading to the ‚Äúfailure of durable investment to develop.‚Äù150 In February 1938 he wrote to FDR, ‚ÄúYou must either give more encouragement to business or take over more of their functions yourself.‚Äù If ‚Äúpublic opinion‚Äù was not ‚Äúyet ripe‚Äù for a greater role for public investment in, say, electric utilities, then ‚Äúwhat is the object of chasing the utilities round the lot‚Ä¶

### As U.S. assembly lines were rolling, Britain began to buy war mat√©riel for which it could not possibly pay. In December 1940, FDR announced that America ‚Äúmust be the great arsenal of democracy.‚Äù A Lend-Lease Bill passed Congress by large majorities. The United States would loan war mat√©riel, food, and critical raw materials‚Äîespecially oil‚Äîto Allies, who, in principle, would return it after the conclusion of hostilities

### The Northeast remained a significant home to shipbuilding, but the Midwest, more impervious to potential foreign attack, fared better.

It took place in the South but above all in the Pacific West.

### In his final, January 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for an ambitious ‚ÄúSecond Bill of Rights,‚Äù of economic rights, guaranteeing jobs, housing, medical care, education, and living wages. All these rights, FDR noted‚Äîhitting the central New Deal keyword‚Äîspelled ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù But in an increasingly conservative Congress, FDR‚Äôs request fell on deaf ears. The Second Bill of Rights dropped like a dud. The narrower GI Bill passed instead.

### Keynes added, In the post-war years there is hardly a country in which we ought not to expect keen political discussions affecting the position of the wealthier classes and the treatment of private property. If so, there will be a number of people constantly taking fright because they think the degree of leftism in one country looks for the time being likely to be greater than somewhere else.

### That blacks ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt even get a hamburger and a Coke at a soda fountain‚Äù became one of the political indignities of racial oppression, as the civil rights leader John Lewis once put it.17 The civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‚Äô60s had long roots in past labor organizing on the side of production. But that the movement made significant breakthroughs in venues of consumption, through boycotts and sit-ins, was no coincidence, reflecting just how charged consumption had become with political meaning.  
---

### In The General Theory, Keynes had assumed that for psychological reasons, personal consumption was a rather stable aggregate, even when personal incomes grew; investment, he thought, was more dynamic. Perhaps Keynes was wrong, many American Keynesians began to think. Not investment but private consumption could both drive and stabilize growth. In part, postwar consumerism was new because of its newly anointed ‚Äúmacroeconomic‚Äù significance.

### Congress passed tax rebates to induce private investment. Altogether the macroeconomy climbed out of recession by the end of 1975 and began an expansion that would last until 1980, making it the second longest of the postwar period.

### Nixon‚Äôs message to the world was clear. The United States would prioritize domestic concerns over international obligations. Thus the ‚ÄúNixon Shock‚Äù of 1971, or the ‚Äúnew economic policy‚Äù as Nixon called it. Nixon‚Äôs Treasury secretary was the Democrat John Connally, a former governor of Texas and a nationalist who believed, ‚ÄúThe foreigners are out to screw us. It‚Äôs our job to screw them first.‚Äù Both men deeply desired to restore U.S. manufacturing‚Äôs international prowess, which Nixon believed was the basis of postwar U.S. geopolitical power.24 As for domestic politics, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll take inflation if necessary,‚Äù Nixon said, but ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt take unemployment.‚Äù

### In policy making, one cannot give Chicago school economists that much credit, however.120 Not Friedman but council chairman Schultze‚Äôs The Public Use of Private Interest had said that markets ‚Äúnot only minimize the need for coercion as a means of organizing society; they also reduce the need for compassion, patriotism, brotherly love, and cultural solidarity as motivating forces behind social improvement.‚Äù121 Let the market discipline when democratic politics could not. Let the market do what the state should not.

### Carter‚Äôs attention to the global scale was the reason the only novel macroeconomic initiative of his presidency played out there‚Äîin a coordinated attempt of states at ‚ÄúInternational Keynesianism.‚Äù Foiling it was another transnational constraint on national sovereignty: not human rights but short-term speculative movements of liquid global capital.  
---

### In ending Bretton Woods, Nixon had sought a shortcut toward restoring the postwar moment of U.S. hegemony. Instead, the result was a regression to an even earlier moment, which had seemingly ended with the Great Depression. Global liquidity preference, and international capital mobility, once again acted as constraints on national economic policy making. The locomotive strategy could not even go into effect before capital fled the dollar, which plummeted. Carter blinked: he announced a new policy of budget balancing, fiscal restraint, and monetary tightening. He brought the G7 along with him.

### Carter asked Lasch what he should do. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù the historian said, true to his calling. At Camp David, Vice President Walter Mondale nearly suffered a nervous breakdown.

### Meanwhile deindustrialization in the northeastern-midwestern manufacturing belt accelerated, with the Midwest suffering the most. Many working people experienced the new ‚Äúprofit orientation‚Äù as something like a shock. In 1980 a round of steel closures hit the Calumet region, south of Chicago and in northwestern Indiana, eliminating ninety thousand manufacturing jobs. Local communities met the closures with ‚Äúbewilderment‚Äù and ‚Äúdisbelief‚Äù because many of the factories were profitable. But they were not profitable enough by the new criteria, applied by executives at an ever-increasing distance from the ‚Äúphysical process.‚Äù

### It seemed that the unintended consequence of the Volcker Shock was to foil even Volcker‚Äôs expectations. If any one person was responsible for the global economy at this moment, it was Paul Volcker, and if he could not answer the question, that said something about the fundamental indeterminacy that was being wired into the new political economy. FDR once knew how much gold was fleeing U.S. borders: none, because he had passed an executive order banning it.

### Pickens never acquired majority control of Gulf Oil, but management paid him ‚Äúgreenmail.‚Äù That is, they bought back the shares that Pickens and his allies had accumulated at a price above the going market rate‚Äîfar above what Pickens‚Äôs group had originally paid.

### Reagan‚Äôs 1981 tax cut had created a new accelerated depreciation credit for ‚Äústructures.‚Äù Manufacturing was the intended target, but the law also applied to commercial real estate. Companies could sell tax credits to one another.97 The paperwork meant more jobs in ‚Äúbusiness services‚Äù for tax lawyers. Rather than building factories, even industrial corporations such as General Motors began to invest in office building construction, if only for the tax credit.

### A new world of service work was taking shape. It was socially interactive, consisting of affective, emotional, and care labor.114 These kinds of service labor were still marked feminine. Few laid-off male steelworkers applied for jobs as home health care aides. Men were more likely to find jobs in ‚Äúself-employment,‚Äù often precarious and with low benefits.

### In 1956 physicist William Shockley had decamped from AT&T‚Äôs Bell Labs in New Jersey and arrived in Palo Alto to live closer to his sick mother and develop transistors. Shockley hired eight young PhDs. In a bizarre turn, following his 1956 Nobel Prize, he started advocating eugenics and founded his own sperm bank. The ‚Äútraitorous eight‚Äù departed and, bankrolled by Sherman Fairchild, son of the first chairman of IBM, founded Fairchild Semiconductor. They used silicon, which amplifies and insulates electricity and possesses extraordinary durability. In 1968 Fairchild begat Intel Corporation, founded by two Fairchild founders, Gordon E.

### Jobs went to Xerox PARC to study the Alto, believing that Xerox‚Äôs investment entitled him to sample its technology.

### The ‚Äúera of big government is over,‚Äù he declared twice in his 1996 State of the Union address, the year he would sign into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act.80 The act was everything Ronald Reagan had ever wanted. It ended a New Deal entitlement‚Äîfederal-government-guaranteed support for indigent citizens. Aid to Families with Dependent Children became Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. By instituting block grants, it devolved much responsibility to states for determining eligibility criteria and benefits. It also let states contract welfare to for-profit corporations or to religious nonprofits

### Decades earlier, U.S. trade with industrialized economies like those of Germany and Japan, which might have enjoyed some advantages but not so many, could not have had such an effect. The China ‚Äúshock‚Äù did. For decades, U.S. manufacturing jobs had been shifting to the low-wage low-unionized South. By 2000 southern migration had played out, and jobs now went overseas.

### Having social and economic life increasingly organized by networks had consequences: they not only ‚Äúscale‚Äù and fluidly mutate, as recognized in the 1990s, but also have the capacity, it turned out, to rigidly exclude. Inequality increased, with respect to income and wealth, in the realm of abstract numbers. But more concretely, in a parallel dynamic of social exclusion, many individuals and groups were simply ejected from the production side of the new economy.  
---

### Back in the 1980s, capital imports were largely Japanese, not Chinese, and they funded U.S. speculation in corporate equities and commercial real estate, not residential housing. The same question posed then echoed during the 2000s, except more loudly: what got built with all this capital and credit? The answer, in this round, was: many McMansions and gas-guzzling Humvees. Indebted American consumers bought the world‚Äôs goods‚ÄîiPhones, PlayStations, flat-screen TVs, and sneakers.

### The problem is that no matter how long, the briefest of downturns wipe out much of the gains from the expansion.
