Path: - Book Four: The Age of Chaos, 1980- > - Preface: Chaos > - Scholars can't agree on what to call our new economy. Certain backward-looking names are apt except that they refer to what it's not, rather than what it is. Examples include "postindustrialist" and "postFordist." Names that refer to it a repeat of a past period don't work either, such as "Second Gilded Age" and "neoliberalism."

### The family resemblance between the leap-of-faith capitalist credit system and Finney‚Äôs leap-of-faith theology is evident. Neither has a transcendent authority.

### Tea Party members were on average conservative, white, old, and relatively well-off citizens who feared the federal government. The Great Recession had taken a giant cut into the wealth of this demographic. Many of its members continued to work instead of retire, resentfully. Others, if they could not find employment, prematurely drew Social Security.73 Tea Partiers said the stimulus had given away money to ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù and thus sacrificed ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù of their own that they had ‚Äúearned‚Äù through a lifetime of work. Freeloaders included especially young people, welfare recipients, and illegal immigrants.
