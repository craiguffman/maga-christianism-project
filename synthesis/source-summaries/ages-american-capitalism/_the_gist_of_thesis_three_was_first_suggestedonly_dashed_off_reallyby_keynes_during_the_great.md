### The great pivot for British North American commercial development was the period after 1660, when Parliament restored Charles II to the British throne eleven years after the execution of his father in the English Civil War. Up until then, English colonization had been a haphazard affair, with early efforts leading to repeated failures—in terms of survival, let alone commercial gain.  
---

### Shaftesbury was to be a leading figure in Restoration England. During the Civil War, he had played both sides, Crown and Parliament, before joining the victorious forces of Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell’s death, Shaftesbury then helped to restore Charles II to the throne. But he remained a vocal critic of royal absolutism, becoming a founder of the liberal-minded Whig Party.  
---

### three building blocks for Shaftesbury’s generation to work with: the ethical ideal of “commonwealth”; the state theory of “political economy”; and the economic doctrine of “balance of trade.”  
---

### Mercantilism was first a political translation of the religious impulse at work in the concept of commonwealth. The commonwealth was an ideal vision of a “body politic,” consisting of interdependent and hierarchical ranks and orders. The dominant metaphor was anatomical. God was the head. Next came the nobility, down the chain of being. The poorest “sort” of commoners was at the bottom. Organically, the commonwealth functioned to achieve the collective interest of the common

### Some religious leaders began to equate commercial gain with spiritual gain, during a wave of evangelical religious awakenings in the 1730s and ’40s, called the First Great Awakening. “Covetousness,” New Jersey reverend Joseph Morgan declared in The Nature of Riches  
---

### Oeconomy was a common project, and women’s contributions to economic life were critical. In this era, women’s labors were visible and valued, placing them in the middle of early American economy.  
---

### Black slaves were human chattel. The colonial law of slavery, at first following the influential Barbados slave code of 1661, moved closer and closer to granting slaves the same attributes of private property as land.  
---

### The great economic historian William Parker once astutely proposed that the early American household had a split economic personality.90 The conflict was between two ideal types that he called the “peasant” and the “gambler” mentalities. All colonial American households were peasants and gamblers to various degrees.  
---

### By the end of the colonial period, great planters and middling yeomanry alike widely practiced a system of commercial “safety first” agriculture, or what households called achieving a “competency.”101 The average early American household directly consumed most household production. At the end of the colonial period, 9 to 13 percent of colonial economic production was destined for Atlantic markets.  
---

### He proposed the following. The United States would pay foreign creditors in full. The domestically held debt would be refinanced, at face value through the issue of bonds that, some technicalities aside, paid 4 percent interest—2 points less than originally promised, reducing the immediate need for federal revenue by a third. To all debt-holders, foreign and domestic, Hamilton guaranteed interest payments in hard currency,  
---

### Hamilton chose the right time. The United States enjoyed its first national commercial boom. The success of Hamilton’s financial reforms deserves some credit. The BUS extended private loans, expanding the supply of money and credit. “Pecuniary capital” augmented. No less crucial were developments at the level of the states. During the 1790s, state governments chartered twenty-eight banks

### the Old Southwest, during the War of 1812, General Andrew Jackson had wrested some 14 million acres from the Creek people. The “Creek Cession” was the crescent-shaped strip roughly three hundred miles long and twenty-five miles across, descending from the southwestern corner of Tennessee, down through central Mississippi

### brilliant orator, Clay was elected to Congress in 1810 at the age of thirty-three—a piercing blue-eyed “hawk,” spoiling for war with the British Empire. During his first term, remarkably, he became the Speaker of the House.

### Later, in the twentieth century, the miser would reappear, taking center stage in the most incisive economic study of hoarding, the English economist John Maynard Keynes’s The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money  
---

### Friendship was a central ethical theme of commercial society, discussed by all sides in the debate over the moral worth of commerce. Barnum, in his autobiography, spoke often of his friends; Smith celebrated friendship in The Theory of Moral Sentiments; Hegel viewed friendship as the quintessence of freedom; Emerson’s great essay on friendship appeared in Essays: First Series

### Slave children entered the workforce at age three or four

### In 1854 Republicans, to appeal to many northerners frustrated with the inequities of economic change, threw in a dash of Jacksonian antimonopoly, newly directed at slaveholders’ ill-gotten gains. Before, antimonopoly had targeted the “Money Power.” But with free banking, and with hard money from the California Gold Rush expanding the money supply, the money question during the 1850s was eerily absent…

### The Homestead Act fulfilled another campaign promise—“free soil”—and helped clear the way for white heads of household to settle the lands west of the Mississippi. The Homestead Act would eventually distribute 270 million acres of land. The last claim would be filed in Alaska in 1988.18

### two great economic changes. Three billion dollars of enslaved capital no longer existed. For the Union, creating the military might necessary to destroy slavery had resulted in a $2.6 billion public debt.  
---

### Upon the Union victory, $1.00 in gold, at the prewar parity exchange rate, traded at $1.50 in paper currency. The policy of returning to par was called resumption. Since resumption would demand fiscal retrenchment and credit contraction, and the government’s resources were limited, political will would be necessary to achieve a meaningful political and economic reconstruction of the South. In the economic reconstruction of the South, much would be up for grabs, and nothing would be more critical than control over land and labor.  
---

### To contract the currency would be to limit the supply of money and credit and potentially deflate values and prices.  
---

### Finally, the role of the South in all this would be to restore cotton production as quickly as possible, for cotton was the only real source of U.S. exports—and thus the hard, foreign exchange earnings necessary to support resumption of a specie standard.  
---

### In 1868 the Republican nominee, General Ulysses Grant, won the presidential election. Grant was a resumptionist, and after his victory, with one-third of Democrats and three-quarters of Republicans in favor, Congress passed the Public Credit Act of 1869, which Grant signed. It pledged the federal government to pay back all U.S. public debt in gold, and promised to the world the eventual resumption of a metallic standard for the dollar at prewar parity.86 Politically, resumption was settled.

### Gould was a man with little political ideology to speak of. By contrast, the elder Vanderbilt, during the 1830s and ’40s, had been the representative Jacksonian businessman who believed in competition, open access, and antimonopoly.

### In all economic history, there have been but two great ruptures. The first was the Neolithic Revolution, roughly ten thousand to twelve thousand years ago, when many populations shifted into settled agriculture on a permanent basis, leaving hunting and gathering behind for good. The second was the industrial revolution, which…

### But “what European miners had done over the span of several centuries, the Americans accomplished in little more than in a single generation.” The Comstock silver lode was discovered in Nevada in 1859; gold in Montana in 1862; silver in Utah, 1869; gold in the Black Hills of Dakota, 1874. Colorado’s coalfields opened in the 1860s and ’70s. During the 1880s, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada began to dominate lead mining. Michigan and Wisconsin ranges were the largest sources of iron ore, until the Mesabi range of northern Minnesota opened. Midwestern petroleum fields dominated until the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Texas, in 1901, soon followed by California exploration.96 By 1900, the United States led the world in the extraction of industrial minerals—ranking first in coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, silver, tungsten, molybdenum, petroleum, arsenic, phosphate, antimony, magnetite, mercury, and salt, as well as a close second place in gold and bauxite.

### In 1923 MIT graduate Alfred Sloan became the Detroit-based president of GM. The corporation developed a sophisticated hierarchy, with power and authority vested in impersonal titles and offices—which was the ongoing corporate trend.110 Mechanization created great demand for skilled, white-collar workers.111 Vice presidents, managers, middle managers, and associates piled into head offices, sitting in standardized chairs, at standardized desks, in standardized office cubicles.112 In a mass society, paradoxically faceless bureaucracy and the cultural celebrity of a figure like Ford arose in tandem.

### During the 1920s, a great speculative upswing unfolded across all sectors. Due to Fordist mass production, expectations of future gains in industrial production were brighter than ever before: in hindsight, the 1920s spread of the electric assembly line beyond the Ford Motor Company brought about the largest surge in labor productivity ever recorded. In

### Hoover’s political philosophy of “neighborly helpfulness” was stretched beyond its economic limit. Neighborly helpfulness could still go a long way, however. The primal need for human community, its endurance under unspeakable hardship, was, in fact, at the heart of Steinbeck’s two great Depression-era novels, The Grapes of Wrath and the earlier Tortilla Flat

### when FDR took office in 1933, a generation of Populist and Progressive policy proposals were already on the shelf, ready for someone to pick them up.13 After all, going off gold was precisely what William Jennings Bryan had demanded in 1896, at the helm of the fused Populist-Democratic ticket. FDR’s first two administrations would draw from old Populist demands for agrarian credit and price supports, and the income…

### A great symbol of the American victory in World War II’s “Battle of the Factories,” Ford Motor Company’s Willow Run B-24 bomber production facility was said to be the largest one-roof factory in the world. On the production line, there was room enough for 110-foot winged airplanes to make full ninety-degree turns.

### The largest migration was the 8 million Americans who moved west of the Mississippi. Los Angeles had been a “Jim Crow town,” but the great migration of more than one million blacks from the South finally began to undermine the regional segregation of southern labor markets from the rest of the country—a great economic blow to Jim Crow in the South.

### When the G7 met in Tokyo in May 1979, the communiqué promised “tight monetary measures and tight and prudent fiscal measures.” The Tokyo G7 communiqué declared that tackling inflation was the “immediate top priority.”131 For the first time since the early 1930s, austerity was back in economic policy making.

### Market advocacy was not new. In the American past, markets had been celebrated in at least three ways: as arenas for a positive vision of individualism, as engines of economic betterment, and as just arbiters of social and political conflict.

### After 2008, as has been the case with every recovery during this age, eventually the expansion began to tighten labor markets, and income gains occurred at the middle to the bottom of the distribution, in this instance beginning in 2014. At this point, the expansion was led by a rising share of personal consumption in GDP, in another continuity: the enduring significance of the American consumer for the global economy.
