### To write this book, I have learned and drawn from a tradition of thought in economics, sustained in the twentieth century by such thinkers as John Maynard Keynes, Thorstein Veblen, Joseph Schumpeter, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, and Albert Hirschman. I have also drawn from the pre-twentieth-century, so-called classical political economists that many of them engaged with, above all Adam Smith but also Karl Marx.

### I would argue for the rightful place of historical analysis in economics, and for a broader vision of what the economy is. Dormant traditions in economic thought once argued for this position. Seeking to revive them, I have tried to recut a wider path in order to make room for the inclusion of many subjects—spanning, say, politics and society, or environment and psyche—that once were but today are not typically seen as relevant to understanding the economy in which we live. My conviction is that these subjects and many others are relevant.

### Thus the propensity to hoard has triumphed again in our own times. The weakness of investment—in terms of quality and quantity—is the key economic problem. If there is one argument, quite prominent over the past decades, that this book argues against, it is that the free mobility of capital will accord with any rational or intelligent design when left to its own devices—that private investment will result in the greatest fulfillment of economic potential, with an allocation of goods that is reasonable, optimal, and just. I object to this argument.

### Smith admired the commercial character of British North America, and today many consider him to be something like a patron saint of capitalism, as, supposedly, he was critical of all government intervention into “the market.”3 That was not so.4 Smith was a theorist of political economy, of the relationship between the ordering of power and the generation of wealth. He made no categorical separation between the political and the economic, or state and market. The question for him was their relationship and the consequences of their complicated overlap. The wealth of nations could be the result only of good policy making.

### No matter how absolutist the pretensions of the Crown were or were not, imperial sovereignty was more aspirational than accomplished. What historians call “composite” and “plural” rule, in which authority was dispersed to different institutions, was common, even inside England.62 Tellingly, joint-stock corporations—subsovereigns of a composite empire—which were owned by private investors, were first granted the task of colonizing North America and governing English subjects.

### In principle, colonial commerce existed to favor England’s balance of trade. The colonies should not produce manufactures but instead should import them from England, stimulating English employment and exports. The colonists must not trade with England’s enemies but must give the home country its commerce. Cromwell’s Navigation Act of 1651 codified a long-standing rule that all colonial trade be conducted in English ships.

### What determines the division of labor? The answer is the “extent of the market,” or the scope for sales. That is, there must be sufficient transactional liquidity—ready markets for goods on the demand side. When markets expand for goods, producers compete for them. They specialize and invest more capital in search of the gains from trade. They do this because of a natural human propensity to “truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.” It is commercial self-interest, or human nature, that is the mainspring of the division of labor. But the division of labor exists only in proportion to the “extent of the market.”

### The household was the central institution of early American economic life—the central institution of life, full stop.17 Kinship, custom, law, and intimacy defined their character. Households carried out the task of “oeconomy,” or the management of household wealth. Households were also governing institutions. In a world of “composite” and “plural” sovereignty, where imperial authority could be weak on its frontier, households, along with corporations, were the ruling subsovereigns of the British Empire.

### North America had more smallish landowners of capital than did Europe. “The hopes of having land of their own & becoming independent of Landlords is what chiefly induces people into America,” noted a New York official.35 As John Locke explained, without secure property rights in land that was free from arbitrary interference, there was no guarantee of republican liberty.

### Many northeastern American Indian communities were seasonally migratory, even if they often still engaged in horticulture, such as the Narragansett, Massachusett, and Wampanoag, populous Algonquian-speaking nations of New England. In such indigenous polities, sovereignty and property did not commonly equate to permanent, fixed possession of land, in either its public or private guise.37 Sovereignty flowed more from human relationships than from territorial possession, which then mapped onto control over resources, justifying multiple claims to them.

### What Jefferson was saying was that an economic life of commerce alone was too unstable to adequately ground an “independent” household. The household had to be able to support itself.

The principal might never be repaid, but interest payments would extend into the infinite future. At present, Hamilton said, the federal government would service only interest payments. To do so, he calculated that the new federal government would need $2.8 million in annual revenue. There would be small internal taxes on property, such as an excise on the production of alcohol. Hamilton also proposed an “impost” on foreign commerce, a modest tariff on imports—by English manufactures mostly.

### The project of republican nation making should not, in his view, be hitched to financial profit seeking.

Aristocracy by birth, perhaps even monarchy, might return.

### What if human beings in a commercial society, instead of hacking each other to death, haggle with each other in order to live, but treat each other falsely, as instrumental means to their own future personal commercial ends?

### Just as, shrewdly, Barnum did not claim to be an authority on his own humbugs, the world of paper money no longer had a central authority to tell anyone whether what they saw had authentic value. After Jackson killed off the Second Bank of the United States, interpersonal trust and credit became even more a basis of what Hamilton had called “pecuniary capital.” Farmers had their land; slave owners had their slaves. But tradesmen had trust, and without trust, instead of constant credit creation, a final reckoning would arrive—the moment when all debts came due. If it did arrive, the result would be bank runs and financial panics.

### A democratization of truth was happening inside the American Museum, which placed on individuals the democratic duty of making judgments. In the American political economy, neither Henry Clay’s American System, nor any other long-term political project of development, was directing commercial prosperity. The money and credit necessary to capitalize commerce and commercial production now bubbled up from below, in the form of democratic, interpersonal acts of trust, as well as a popular state of confidence and expectations. Arising from these excitements, doubts, and questions, emotional states and psychological drives fueled the speculative upswing in the credit cycle, which induced investment and pulled along commercial development.

### To Herman Melville, Thoreau’s transcendentalism was a moral tyrant. Melville also recognized that many moral checks on commerce were fading fast, and he was worried, too, but he came to think differently from Thoreau about the morality of capitalist commerce. Rather than celebrating the market or pushing back against its always-corrosive effects, Melville wondered if commercial investment might be appropriated as a means toward a morally worthy end.

### Historically, the best measure of capitalism’s presence may not be the presence of its many defining features—capital, market activity, technological innovation, wage labor, or something else. All these things have existed to greater or lesser degrees for a long time, even if just at the margins. What defines capitalism’s presence, rather, is not a presence but a relative absence. In the United States, the Age of Commerce had arrived at a point where it made sense for Melville to ask the following question, and to write an entire novel mulling over it: What would happen if economic life—nay, life itself—were nothing more than a running series of commercial transactions in pursuit of future pecuniary gain?

He keeps all future options, all desires, all possible future speculations, open and alive. Yet by continuing to hoard pathologically, the miser never exercises any of his options. Death will come to him before any enjoyment in life does. Hoarding and speculation are of the same complex.

### Inside the shops, employers and employees were “masters” and “servants.” Master “mechanics” employed “apprentices” and “journeymen,” former apprentices who aspired to be “independent” mechanics.72 Servants were legally bound to fulfill the contractual terms of employment, subject to the disciplinary authority of their masters.

### In 1832 no less than 40 percent of the remunerated U.S. manufacturing workforce was women or children. They were all paid less to perform the same work as adult men. The larger the manufacturing establishment, and the larger the capital requirements, the more firms relied on unskilled female and child labor. In textile firms with more than fifteen employees, 73.4 percent of employees were women or girls.76 In large-scale cotton plantations and large-scale textile manufacturers alike, the labor of women and children was the key swing component.

### The status of waged work was changing greatly in the North. Rather than a household dependency, it was becoming a variety of free labor. Ideologically, wage work was transforming from a dependency associated with femininity to a badge of male independence. Legally, it transformed masters and servants into employers and employees with different sets of legal obligations. Notably, the free labor doctrines emerging in the United States were quite “radical” compared to those of other countries.90 They were not the foreordained endpoint of capitalist development.

### The abolition of slavery in the North inaugurated the history of free labor there. New England abolished it first, in the midst of the Revolution or shortly thereafter.91 Elsewhere it took more time.92 A critical moment came when masters attempted to enroll emancipated slaves in long-term contracts as their servants. Northern legal decisions overturning these ruses undermined long-term contracts of all kinds, including even some forms of apprenticeship.93 Free labor required more than the abolition of involuntary servitude; it would also require the outlawing of many kinds of coercion and unfreedom in the workplace.

### What emerged, slowly, was an American right to quit work, a doctrine formalized legally decades later as “employment at will.” Indentured servitude and legal punishments for “absconding from service” during the length of a labor contract fell by the wayside. Corporeal punishment of workers, even where and when it remained legal, was no longer practical, since workers, if beaten, often simply walked off the job—and demanded compensation for work already performed.

### The gender ideology of “separate spheres” was yet another example of public and private sphering, giving rise to a new tension specific to an industrial society that was premised on borders from without rather than entanglements within.

### Over the next century, however, nothing, not even the new industrial factories, would be more central to the industrial order than the breadwinner-homemaker family, which arose as yet another late–Age of Commerce solution to the same old problem: how might commerce be promoted, yet still be checked and kept within its proper bounds? During the 1840s and ’50s, the organization of family life made it clear that North and South gave two very different answers to this question. The growing distinction, which occurred in tandem with an economic divergence, contributed to the convulsion in politics.

In these territories, white male heads of household would vote on whether to have slavery.

### For decades, the corn-and-hog complex of the Ohio River Valley was commercially connected to the slave plantations of the Old Southwest. In 1830 the Ohio-Mississippi river system took virtually the entirety of northwestern commercial traffic. In future decades, northwest commerce would shift from the southwest to the northeast. A contributing factor was the South’s post–Panics of 1837 and 1839 retreat to “safety first” subsistence strategies, in the context of the shift to paternalism.113 Northwestern foodstuffs were less in demand in the South. New interregional railroads linked the Northwest and the Northeast over the mountains. Altogether, by the 1850s, most northwestern goods were shipped by rail to the East rather than downriver to the South.

### To commit to an invariable metallic standard, the United States would have to devalue its currency and fiscally retrench. It must close budget deficits, signaling to investors that it would never help finance them by inflating away the value of the public debts, owned by the government’s creditors.68 Austerity would mean that wartime taxes could be rolled back, if not eliminated, also placating private investors fearful of taxation. The high tariff, while necessary to fund gold payments on the debt, could also be radically reduced. Federal revenue should be devoted to retiring greenbacks, bringing the “gold premium” closer to prewar parity, and extinguishing the U.S. public debt.

### Thus the mid-Atlantic region industrialized differently from New England. It specialized in the production of intermediate capital goods, like metals and machines, rather than consumer goods such as textiles. In New England, waterpower drove the textile mills, so they flourished in small, rural villages.44 But in the mid-Atlantic, the backward and forward linkages of coal, steam, iron, and steel first appeared in urban settings. By 1870 there were seven hundred steam engines in the anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania.45 Cheap coal made the stationary steam engine economical in manufacturing. Greater urban agglomerations of manufacturing became possible, which created network effects. Urban population growth strongly correlated with the adoption of the steam engine in manufacturing.46 In the city factories, the coal-fired steam engine ran continuously, at command. Unlike waterwheel or windmill power, steam power was impervious to the natural rhythms of climate and weather. Carnegie ran his steelworks twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

### Ford had a final motivation: he was also in the business of producing men. The five dollars were not a daily wage. A portion was called a profit share, granted only under certain conditions. The worker had to live the right way, as the company’s “sociology department” administered the five-dollar-day program. As one Ford manager explained, an unskilled worker received “$2.34 per day for working” and “another $2.66 for living as the company wanted him to live.” “Drinking” and “riotous living” were forbidden, as were “lack of thrift,” “domestic trouble,” and “indebtedness.” The sociology department conducted home inspections, such that “there was nothing to keep from them.” “This man lives in a dirty unsanitary hut,” Ford records read. Or “Polish wedding, Drunk.” “My wife told them everything,” one worker lamented. Ford’s vision was total.

From it would issue a long historical arc, into the twenty-first century, from the Great Depression to the Great Recession.

### In the late 1930s, it was needed. Capitalists themselves still suffered from disquietude and were falling down on the job of investment, hoarding out of precaution instead.

### Some historians have argued that the New Deal’s turn toward budget deficits in 1938 represented the “end of reform,” since New Deal liberalism became preoccupied with adjusting macroeconomic aggregates rather than transforming the core institutions of capitalism through political and legal interventions.155 The attempt to induce greater private investment by slashing taxes on the owners of capital—a core policy staple of New Deal liberalism over the decades, persisting to this day—confirms such an analysis.

### From price, wage, and profit controls, to high rates of income taxation, the extraordinary interventions taken by the federal government to restrain the price level and halt inflation are worthy of note—given their implications for the long-term fate of New Deal liberalism in the Age of Control. When the state held down interest rates on short- and long-term loans in order to induce private fixed investment, and issued debt to finance budget deficits and public investment, it pulled in untapped resources: labor, machines, and technological know-how. That led to the growth of total output and employment. But there were limits. Should there be no more resources left to draw from, should the “macroeconomy” reach its productive limit, monetary and fiscal expansion might lead to inflation—more money chasing a limited amount of goods. There is nothing wrong with inflation per se.

In mark-to-market accounting, the present market value of assets, foretelling future incomes, is what matters. The horizon is perpetually short-term. Future “return on equity,” or the trajectory of the stock, replaces “return on investment,” or the return on the company’s past outlay of resources, in order to produce something and sell it above its cost of production. The distant past is wiped out. So is the distant future, as the future collapses into the present price of an asset, updated by the millisecond.

### Unlike Wal-Mart in the 1990s, Amazon in the 2000s was not responsible for lowering retail prices—that new economy effect, cheaper goods, now trailed off. Amazon most benefited “busy, high earning households.”30 For these high-earnings households, increasingly, were two-income households, with less time for shopping. Amazon offered not lower prices so much as time savings. Because of Amazon, at the opening of the twenty-first century, the average well-off American consumer could, lying in bed, order with a click on the laptop or a swipe on the phone, various products from around the world and reasonably expect their rapid arrival on their doorstep in two days. But Amazon’s rise to market dominance through below-cost pricing meant it began to acquire the power to prevent market competition—as well as place demands on its suppliers. Further, when profits arrived at Amazon, they would come not from consumer retail but rather from Amazon Web Services, which offered data storage and “cloud” computing for businesses.

### Geithner had come of age at Treasury’s international desk during the 1990s, and to him the Panic of 2007–8, while grander, was little different from the Mexican currency crisis of 1994 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98.

### Whether it was the stress tests or something else—perhaps the government’s forced recapitalization of the banks, perhaps finally a waning of fear in the markets—the fog of disquietude began to lift.

### One bet seems safe. Politics stands to assert more authority over economics. But an authority wielded by whom, on what basis, and toward what ends?

### What would it mean for American economic life to break free from the patterns of the Age of Chaos, and to capitalize and chart a different and better economic future? The question demands economic imagination. It calls for moral and political courage.
