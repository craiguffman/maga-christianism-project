## Highlights

### during World War II, the state finally intervened and, through the fiscal multiplier of public investment in military production, ended the Great Depression. The United States ascended to hegemonic position in the world economy. The postwar period saw a private corporate investment boom in industry, the rise of consumerism, and the attempt of Cold War liberalism to stabilize the U.S. domestic and world economies.

### John Winthrop, governor of the early Massachusetts Bay Colony, was a wealthy lawyer from Sussex, one of the most commercial regions in England. In 1630 he boarded the ship Arbella bound for America and sat down to write “A Model of Christian Charity.” Winthrop’s blueprint for a “city on a hill” was boilerplate commonwealth. God intended hierarchy: “in all times some must be rich, some poor, some high and eminent in power and dignity; others mean and in subjection.”

### Mercantilists generally promoted subsidies, taxes, and tariffs to protect employment-intensive as well as hard-currency-earning manufacturing exports.61 They wanted more commercial investment, and they would also target its content—industry. Still today, policies that subsidize domestic manufacturers are called mercantilist.  
---

### trade within the British Empire became so mutually beneficial that the Navigation Acts became nearly self-enforcing. Colonists complained about the shortage of coin  
---

### Capitalistic to be sure, the great planters’ turn to black slavery in eighteenth-century Virginia oeconomy also became a self-consciously patriarchal project.  
---

### From his position in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson became the most articulate defender and advocate of a popular oeconomical ideology that said commerce, while it must be promoted, must also be held in check. He would take this vision into revolutionary battle.  
---

### Foreign commercial policy was no trifling matter. Not only did export markets provide American commerce with its most critical source of demand, geopolitically the U.S. republic was born a minor power in a world of belligerent empires. In his approach, Hamilton chose commercial rapprochement with the British Empire. Meanwhile, emulating the British model, as secretary of the Treasury he launched an ambitious federal program to kick-start long-term national economic development. Finance, commerce, and manufacturing would prosper in unison—Enlightenment “improvement” on a grand scale. To initiate economic development, Hamilton would opportunistically reorganize the public finances. He would have the federal government capitalize a long-term public debt, a step toward fostering a dynamic private capital and credit market, as British experience proved. He would also charter a Bank of the United States in the image of the Bank of England. On behalf of his various projects, Hamilton always sought to energetically entangle private profit seeking and public power, market and state.  
---

### He gambled that the right application of state power might just conjure a U.S. financial system capable of capitalizing commerce, agriculture, and manufacturing all at once. Likewise, he judged from the contemporary British example that not just more commerce—as in the classical mercantilist’s larger slice from the pie of world trade—but rather intensive national economic development was fast becoming the lever of power in international relations.

### Jefferson had first invoked the “Empire of Liberty” in 1780, to evoke a political confederation to benefit rural white heads of household, the yeoman subsovereigns of the republic. There was no way to have it without the colonization of the trans-Mississippi West. The project also required diverting a “branch of commerce,” as Jefferson put it, toward the Mississippi River.94 Upon taking office in 1801, Jefferson set about putting the program in action. To succeed would be to end U.S. commercial dependence on Atlantic commerce. At stake was the same phenomenon that had given rise to the Age of Commerce in the era of mercantilism—the geopolitics of market access and trade.  
---

### after 1803 the Napoleonic Wars heated up, and neutral shipping in the Atlantic once again flourished. From 1805 to 1807, freight charges alone exceeded U.S. domestic exports.  
---

### In 1836 Illinois began construction on the Illinois and Michigan Canal to open a commercial waterway from the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes, via the new city of Chicago.  
---

### In contrast to timeworn religious counsels about the perils of too much commerce and also to the Jeffersonian critique of possible market dependence, Walden was part of a new, transatlantic intellectual movement, known as romanticism, that had grown suspicious of capitalist commercialization altogether. The Romantics feared that the heartless world of commercial appearances was overtaking reality.  
---

### After the closing of the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, slave owners could no longer replenish their capital stock from abroad. Slave capital would have to reproduce itself sexually, as white masters grew ever more dependent on the reproductive labors of black women. Between 1790 and 1860, the U.S. slave population doubled every twenty-eight years, an increase of 2.5 percent per annum.48 In addition to “portability,” positive fertility was a second unique characteristic of enslaved human capital, compared to other forms of capital.  
---

### Finally, during the 1850s, northern manufacturing pushed at the productive limits of the organic economy. Coal-fired steam engines began to power many lines of production.  
---

### after the recovery from the Panic of 1837, the invisible hand of the market began to fall down on the job of political union. The expansion of commerce began to sharpen rather than alleviate sectional differences.110 The task of maintaining the Union was dropped into the hands of politicians. There may be no greater example of the power of democratic politics to determine capitalism’s future than the sudden rise of the antislavery Republican Party after 1854.111

### The South became trapped in an unjust and inefficient sharecropping system that blocked long-term southern economic development, even as it enabled a…  
---

### The national debt increased from $65 million to $2.7 billion and transformed the American financial system. The public bond market fueled the national accumulation of finance capital, just as Alexander Hamilton had once said it would. Bond holdings also began to nationalize a more uniform banking system.  
---

### In December 1861 the Union departed from a metallic standard. Thereafter the Treasury Department guaranteed interest payments on the public debt only in gold, and nothing else.  
---

### As U.S. bonds replaced gold as the basis of the money supply, these banks were legally required to hold a third of their capital reserve in public debt. Against these reserves, the comptroller of the currency issued another national…  
---

### Further, to the Stevens wing, greenbacks—unbacked by gold or silver—would make the domestic U.S. capital market freer from foreign dependency. Returning to gold would link the American and British money and capital markets. In 1866 a banking panic crashed London financial markets, and the Bank of England raised its interest rate in the short-term money market, which drained gold from the United States into Britain, in search of the higher yield. But because the greenback was not pegged to gold, the U.S. money market remained unstirred.  
---

### The protective industrial tariff survived the war. Rates actually increased. In 1870 the duty on finished steel rails was raised to twenty-eight dollars per ton, equivalent to the entire British selling price.81 The tariff and continued fiscal retrenchment meant that wartime taxes could be reduced. Beginning in 1866, bills chipped away at, and finally eliminated, income taxation, as well as excise and license taxes  
---

### Long-term, high-grade railroad bond rates settled in the low 6 percent region after the war.118 That was the hurdle for profit making from enterprise. Why do that, and of necessity divert resources to pay workers, when one could make profits from short-term financial speculations without paying anyone? Economic inequality increased in this era much because many of the owners of reconstructed capital sometimes could not find good answers to these questions. They manipulated finance to enrich themselves.  
---

### The policy of resumption had harnessed the U.S. economy to the international gold standard and thus to the fortunes of international economic events. In 1873 gold began to drain from the United States to Britain. After the crash of the stock exchange in Vienna, shaky credit conditions in Europe led to a competitive panic among the owners of capital to hold safe, liquid assets.142 As everyone sought to get their hands on gold, the Bank of England saw the British banking system’s gold reserves dwindle. In response, it raised its short-term bank interest rate from 4 to 9 percent. Seeking the higher yield and fearful of a general panic, gold deposits swung into British banks from everywhere, including from the United States. Credit began to contract on Wall Street.  
---

### An additional problem was that, to fund their operations, U.S. railroad corporations had grown dependent on the short-term call money market to help roll over their prodigious debts. U.S. railroad corporate debt had climbed from $416 million in 1867 to $2.2 billon in 1870.144 By 1873, interest rate yields on fresh railroad bonds remained at 6 percent. Yet rates in the short-term call money market soared from 3.8 percent to 61.23 percent.  
---

### More than future economic prosperity of any kind, let alone a northeastern- and European-owned railroad, southern congressional politicians were now invested, above all, in the restoration of local rule in pursuit of the maintenance of white supremacy.159 Republicans acquiesced. In the Compromise of 1877, Hayes became president. U.S. troops left South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, and the military occupation of the South was formally over. Reconstruction was finished.  
---

### Scott taught Carnegie everything he knew. The Penn Railroad deployed prodigious amounts of productive fixed capital, in rails, cars, and locomotives. Due to the running costs of using up that capital, the railroad had to run its cars as fast and as full as possible. To do so, the corporation became the first great modern managerial enterprise, probably the most efficient business bureaucracy in the world at that time.  
---

### Scott, an entrepreneurial two-face, also taught Carnegie the art of short-term speculation in liquid capital markets, as well as the art of corporate self-dealing.  
---

### Jones also developed a method of pouring steel directly into ingot molds that sat on moving flatcars, a premonition of mechanized assembly-line production, which would be, in Henry Ford’s automobile factories, the productive culmination of the Age of Capital.  
---

### Indeed, the profits took care of themselves. In its first month of operations, the Thomson works turned a profit of $11,000—a figure Carnegie believed was unprecedented in the history of U.S. manufacturing. In 1888 the annual profits of the Carnegie Steel Company were $2 million. In 1890, they reached $5.4 million.20 In manufacturing nothing like this had ever happened in the history of the world.  
---

### In the early 1890s, in the absence of major recent world gold discoveries and in the wake of a surge in silver mining in the U.S. West, the market ratio of gold to silver hovered near 30 to 1. “Silverites” decrying the “Crime of ’73” demanded that the U.S. Mint freely coin silver at 16 to 1. That would enrich silver producers but also increase the U.S. hard money supply, reflate prices, prompt credit expansion, and ease the economic depression.  
---

### Bryan, a former lawyer, took the podium in Chicago on July 9, 1896, and proceeded to give arguably the most electrifying speech in all U.S. political history.  
---

### The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, passed because of agrarian political power in Congress, created something different from what either monetary theorists or Wall Street bankers had wanted—twelve regional reserve banks. These “banker’s banks” accepted the deposits and discounted the notes of other banks. By law, the national banks had to purchase stock in the twelve reserve banks and hold their reserves in them. Ownership came with voting rights to determine the board members and governors of the regional reserve banks. The regional banks printed federal reserve notes, which replaced the national banknotes and became the sole U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve was required to have 40 percent of the currency backed by gold reserves. Each regional bank had the discretion to set its own interest rates on loans to its members. Immediately, given the importance of the Wall Street capital market, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became the most powerful of the twelve banks. The president appointed and the Senate confirmed a seven-member board to oversee the Federal Reserve.  
---

### The electrification of assembly in the 1910s and ’20s gave rise to even greater capital deepening, and stupendous gains in productivity occurred.13 From negligible amounts in 1900, electricity powered 78 percent of U.S. industry by 1929.14 During the 1920s, U.S. manufacturing productivity increased at an annual rate in excess of 5 percent—the fastest rate of growth of any decade on record.  
---

### Peace brought a dramatic worldwide postwar economic cycle of inflation and deflation, as nations had departed from but now returned to the gold standard.  
---

### The first generation to live through industrialization often experienced it as uprootedness—perhaps from rural life and the stolidity of the land. Many of Ford’s workers were European peasants. Nonetheless, when gazing up at the Rouge, it was hard not to think that, after the rupture of industrial revolution, the time horizon was now extending, and that economic life was at last settling down into a long-term structure.  
---

### Quickly, in addition to being a symbol of economic modernism, the Rouge became an aesthetic symbol of cultural modernism.  
---

### After 1921, General Motors was under the controlling interest of a Delaware explosives manufacturer, the DuPont Company. GM’s Chevrolet model began to compete with the Model T. GM’s mass production methods were more flexible. It built more lines of cars, catering to different consumer market niches. Grudgingly, Ford began to paint the Model T different colors. GM also encouraged its customers to buy on credit. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation  
---

### Modernity and progress evoked efficient, linear, straight-line time—the path of Ford’s sped-up electric-powered assembly line, capable of such great production.  
---

### by now the United States was at the center of global finance. After World War I, the world owed the country $12 billion. The United States sat on most of the world’s gold reserves, and the Federal Reserve was newly burdened by the responsibility of maintaining the worldwide gold standard.  
---

### In sum, U.S. loans to Germany began to be recycled into reparations payments to Britain and France, which then traveled back across the Atlantic to pay down British and French war debts.  
---

### was one; also, corporate profits began to disappoint. The Fed, seeking to temper speculation, raised its short-term interest rate on money above 10 percent. The hurdle rate for speculative investment had become exceedingly high, and finally the credit markets broke. Money and credit became tight, as expectations shifted. In agriculture, dealers who had speculatively accumulated large inventories of crops, confident that future prices would rise, now changed their minds and dumped commodities on the market.  
---

### By March 1928, dealers had accumulated 48.2 million bushels of corn. By July 1929, they had dumped more than 30 million bushels on the market. Prices fell. Farm incomes dropped, sapping consumer demand for manufactures. In July industrial production began to fall.43 In August total economic output began to drop.  
---

### The era’s great admiration for energy in machines and in power utilities carried over to the vigorous figure of Hoover. In 1920 he supported Republican Warren Harding’s candidacy for president, and upon his election he became secretary of commerce—“and Undersecretary of all other Departments,” as one official put it.57 After Harding’s death, he continued to actively serve under President Coolidge, who by contrast was a taker of prodigious White House naps.  
---

### In April 1929, Hoover called Congress into special session, and in June he signed the Agricultural Marketing Act. The U.S. Treasury would inject $500 million of capital into a new Federal Farm Board to finance agricultural cooperatives  
---

### Agreeing in principle with Mellon, a number of other economic thinkers proposed, too, that only from widespread bankruptcy could general prosperity ever return. For on this account, the cause of the crisis was overinvestment in an inflationary boom, which called for less investment after the bust. The purge of the system would re-equilibrate savings and investment at a higher rate of interest and at lower prices, including wages.  
---

### In the early 1930s, short-term capital movements among countries became, in the words of President Hoover, a “loose cannon on the deck of the world in a tempest-tossed era.”75 Nonetheless, Hoover’s own commitment to the gold standard destroyed the U.S. economy and with it his presidency.  
---

### While the Fed had been lowering interest rates, now in October 1931 it raised interest rates from 1.5 to 3.5 percent. This was a grave error, as the restricted supply of credit and money was another blow to spending of all kinds.  
---

### Finally in January 1932, Congress created the Hoover-approved Reconstruction Finance Corporation  
---

### As for the Great Depression, the numbers from the beginning of the slump in August 1929 until it hit the very bottom in March 1933 are staggering. U.S. consumer expenditures fell from $79 billion to $64.6 billion.104 The value of world trade was down 65 percent.105 U.S. prices dropped 30 percent. U.S. industrial production declined 37 percent. Of the workforce, 22.9 percent were unemployed, and of those employed, one-third worked less than full time. Industrial unemployment hit 37.6 percent.

A postwar real estate boom, in the suburbs, saw the construction of single-family homes, highways, shopping malls, and strip malls.

### in Washington, liberalism lost its nerve. An era of deregulation began, as high rates of inflation destabilized long-term expectations, which had the effect of pulling economic horizons toward the present, crippling political control. After an internationally coordinated Keynesian stimulus was perceived to fail, due to speculative cross-border attacks on the U.S. dollar, the administration…

### FDR appointed RFC board member Jesse H. Jones its new chairman. Jones hailed from Houston, a city Jones believed, rightly, was destined to become the “Chicago of the South.” After FDR, Jones was arguably the second most powerful man in the country during the 1930s. He was a banker, a Democratic Party operative, and an old Bryanite who believed Wall Street had monopolized capital and credit.  
---

### More consequential than the Securities Act was the Banking Act of 1933, commonly named after its southern Democratic sponsors, Carter Glass of Virginia and Henry B. Steagall of Alabama. Glass-Steagall separated deposit-taking and loan-granting commercial banking from securities-underwriting investment banking. J.…  
---

### The NRA suspended antitrust law. The plan was that all the firms in every industrial sector would cooperatively agree on “industry codes”—binding agreements to limit production volumes, prices, and wages. The NRA was modeled after the short-lived War Industries Board of World War I, but government intervention of this kind outside wartime was unprecedented in U.S. history.  
---

### Furthering the downgrading of the power of the New York Fed, five of the twelve regional bank presidents joined the governors on a rotating basis on the new Federal Open Market Committee, which enjoyed the power to set short-term interest rates in the money market and to determine member bank reserve requirements. The effect was to dilute the power of private bankers in monetary policy.  
---

### Meanwhile, after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, as many feared a Nazi-induced inflation, much gold departed from Europe and fled into the U.S. banking system, which helped expand credit and raise prices.  
---

### During FDR’s first term, farm incomes increased 50 percent.120 New Deal policies also began to induce people to leave the land. Before, underemployment in the U.S. agricultural sector had acted as an economic drag, especially in the South, given the toxic marriage of sharecropping and white supremacy. Mechanization had failed to take command during the Age of Capital. At first, New Deal legislation remained locked in its “southern cage,” dependent on the votes of Jim Crow Democrats.  
---

### The foreign buying spree began in the summer of 1938, after a group of British officials toured Lockheed Aircraft’s California facilities. By April 1940, Britain and France ordered nearly six thousand planes, injecting $573 million into fledgling firms such as Douglas, Lockheed, North…

### After Great Britain and France declared war on Germany following its 1939 invasion of Poland, Congress revised the Neutrality Acts so that the United States could still export arms to the Allies. Over the objections of more isolationist…

### Bombers were made from aluminum—an industry that up until then had been dominated by one corporation, Alcoa. Refining aluminum takes twelve times as much energy as refining steel. DPC capital helped the Reynolds Metal Company develop facilities in both Alabama and Washington, near cheap sources of public hydropower. World War II would help launch both the airplane and the aluminum industries.  
---

### In the summer of 1941, Japanese forces moved south into Indochina. In response, the United States embargoed oil and froze all Japanese assets. Japan had imported most of its fuel from the United States, but now watched Lend-Lease American oil tankers cruise to the Soviet Union while its own supply diminished. On  
---

### The Axis powers fought a relatively labor-intensive war compared to the capital-goods-intensive U.S. variety. Hitler’s bloody drive for direct colonial control over eastern European raw materials and coerced, unskilled labor appeared ever more anachronistic as U.S. state capital financed one technologically innovative mass production industry after another from Seattle to San Diego.  
---

### In 1944 the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China began to deliberate over the creation of the United Nations. The same year, 730 delegates from 44 Allied nations met at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to negotiate working principles for the postwar reconstruction of the world economy.

### By 1948, the moment had closed. The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union had begun, and the world was splitting into capitalist and Communist blocs. The structure of the postwar capitalist world economy solidified. Bretton Woods named the U.S. dollar, newly pegged to gold, as the world’s currency of reserve—against which to peg the world’s other currencies. By exporting capital,…

### **Tags:** #pink - First, mass consumption became a truly national phenomenon, as television, the “selling machine in every room,” slowly replaced radio as the dominant medium of communication.11 By 1960, the so-called average American watched twenty-five hours of television per week.12 It was no longer possible to escape a national, homogenizing mass consumer culture—especially as immigration dramatically slowed down in the decades after the Immigration Act of 1924.

### **Tags:** #pink - political significance of consumption changed after World War II, as the very ground of civic identity shifted. It became more consumerist.  
---

### More than a century old, the long industrial epoch of American capitalism came to a close during the 1970s. Actually, the share of total U.S. employment in manufacturing peaked during World War II at 38 percent, at which time there were already more employees in the “service-providing industries.” After the war, in raw totals, service employment expanded while manufacturing held steady, but during the 1970s evidence abounded of a structural shift.

### But persistent, volatile, and high inflation may destabilize expectations and, by creating uncertainty, pull economies into the short-term present. That undermines long-term development.  
---

### When Carter returned to Washington from Tokyo, his approval ratings were dipping into the 20s—Nixon Watergate territory.  
---

### The overhang of Vietnam surely explains why the federal government’s crisis of legitimacy during the 1970s was so severe.134 But the 1970s “energy crisis” had many manifestations. The oil shocks made that crucial input more expensive and contributed to a productivity slowdown in the most energy-intensive industries, all of them together triggering inflation. At the same time, as the sun set on industrial society, Carter sensed a broader enervation of the polity that undermined long-term expectations and stuck the U.S. economy into the inflationary present.  
---

### Volcker turned to Milton Friedman’s monetarist policies, which produced the final shock of the decade, the “Volcker Shock.” Up till then, normal practice for the Fed had been to target an interest rate in the short-term money market, which indirectly loosened or tightened the money supply. But now Volcker would attempt to use the Fed’s powers to directly target the growth of the quantity of money. He would leave interest rates alone, to set themselves freely in the market. Volcker was not a monetarist, but he liked the optics of it, saying, “More focus on the money supply also would be a way of telling the public that we meant business.”136 At the same time, the Carter administration also mandated credit controls. Altogether interest rates spiked, above 17 percent in April 1980.  
---

### Dramatically, the Fed had reasserted the scarcity value of money capital. The high interest rates that resulted from monetarist policy recruited short-term capital into the United States and halted the dollar’s decline. Meanwhile the reduced money supply and high cost of credit finally assaulted inflation and inflationary expectations. No less significantly, left to the markets, interest rates began to experience extreme volatility. Volcker had attacked inflation but had also exacerbated uncertainty. The predictable consequence of all this was to halt all kinds of spending. In the second quarter of 1980, GDP contracted by 7.9 percent.  
---

### The Volcker Shock transformed the character of capital investment at home and abroad. In the world economy, high U.S. interest rates brought about a worldwide credit crunch and worldwide economic depression. Seeking high interest rates, global capital moved into the U.S. capital market in prodigious amounts. The value of the dollar soared. Accordingly, the U.S. trade deficit expanded. This new pattern would ultimately stick. It was an utter reconfiguration of U.S. global economic hegemony. After World War II, like other hegemons of the past, the United States was an exporter of capital and goods. After the Volcker Shock, it became a net…  
---

### A historically low short-term interest rate from the Fed supported a genuine worldwide economic boom, centered on the rise of China as a world manufacturing power after its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Regions of China became ever more linked to U.S. multinational supply chains, as Chinese producers exported such things as flat-screen televisions and, beginning in 2007, Apple’s iPhone, into the great U.S. consumer market. To help finance U.S. consumption and to accumulate dollar-denominated assets—the world’s safest, most risk-free, liquid investment—China also began to export prodigious amounts of its savings into the U.S. capital market. That helped hold down long-term interest rates as well.  
---

### But the story of the Great Recession is one of economic continuity. Many people suffered, losing their homes and jobs, but capitalism continued to bestow most of its benefits upon the best off, whose interests politicians protected. In this crisis, politics failed to chart a viable new long-term vision of economic life, as had been the case after the Great Depression. Instead, the Great Recession slowly began to show signs of lifting, as another new asset-led macroeconomic expansion, to last over the 2010s, began to exhibit many of the same qualities as every single one since…  
---

### Even if Volcker’s Fed would scrap monetarism, Friedman’s basic argument prevailed. This meant the Fed had to follow a simple and transparent “rule.” It should target a noninflationary and thus “neutral” interest rate, neutral in that it kept the growth of the money supply in line with the growth of the real economy. The Fed had only to set the right interest rate and it could sit back and watch the market economy optimize itself. Inflation could take priority over unemployment, since with low inflation and a stable general price level, employment would find equilibrium at its “natural” market level.

### During the inflationary 1970s, Mexico, like many Latin American countries, had taken advantage of the low real cost of capital and high world commodity prices to borrow heavily in public debt markets. U.S. commercial banks had recycled petrodollars from oil-producing economies into Latin American public debt.36 The high interest rates of the Volcker Shock undermined commodity prices and plunged the world into recession. The price of oil thus fell—one reason the Volcker Shock so diminished inflation in the United States. However, high U.S. interest rates made it more difficult for Latin American sovereigns to roll over their debts. Mexico was the most exposed country, and Citibank was the most exposed U.S. commercial bank. Chairman Walter Wriston had once quipped, “Countries don’t go bankrupt.”37 But foreign investors were questioning that belief. Mexico was suffering from short-term capital flight. In June 1982 the Fed was debating whether to grant Mexico a $600 million credit line, an injection of funding that would be only a bridge loan to a much larger International Monetary Fund  
---

### Arguably, in no era has monetary policy ever mattered so much as the era after 1980. For as capital became more liquid and convertible, the Fed’s targeted interest rate became ever more a global benchmark for the flow of global investment, as the Fed—if belief in the presence of a market for a debt ever waned—became responsible for ensuring the transactional liquidity upon which the smooth functioning of one big global capital market was more and more premised.  
---

### The Fed ended the monetarist experiment in 1982, returning to targeting short-term interest rates rather than the money supply—lowering interest rates if just a bit, to help ease the recession.  
---

### In 1982 Reagan doubled down on Nixon’s “War on Drugs.” Rates of black male incarceration for nonviolent drug offenses surged in particular, but in general white incarceration increased at the same rate as black. The U.S. prison population climbed from around 300,000 to over 1 million by 1996. The United States became by far the most punitive state in the world. Spending on incarceration increased as means-tested welfare benefits and public housing expenditures fell.

### When the Volcker Shock hit and a worldwide economic recession broke out, interest rates on funding shot up, resulting in crippling public debt crises—in Latin America and Africa especially. But even some eastern European Communist countries, Poland being the most dramatic case, had gone to the capital markets to attempt to borrow their way out of the industrial doldrums. These regimes doubled down on their investments in capital goods industrialism, in a gamble that failed. Communism would perish.

### By the turn of the millennium, the world’s most vibrant economic region was the Transpacific West—specifically, the vast region under the pledged security protection of the U.S. military, including California and Washington but also Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand.13 In particular, capital focused on a location where U.S. military contracts, university scientists, Japanese-design-obsessed engineers, Buddhism-curious hippie entrepreneurs, and venture capital all mixed.

### the long-term rate had remained stubbornly high even when, to stoke the “jobless” post 1990–91 recession recovery, the Fed brought short-term rates down to 3 percent in 1993. Even if inflation was not yet presently appearing, Rubin speculated that bond traders were pricing inflation into the long-term rate. What the federal government had to do was balance the federal budget, signaling fiscal rectitude. Rubin could not read bond traders’ minds, but his reasonable analysis was that the high long-term interest rates of the 1980s had created a high hurdle rate for profit making, inducing leveraged speculation. Lower rates would free up capital for long-term fixed investment. Rubin thus recommended catering economic policy to the whims, real or perceived, of capital markets.

### In 1995 the dollar began to rise in value. U.S. trade deficits reappeared. So did capital imports from abroad, which helped finance American consumers’ purchases of the world’s goods. The post–Volcker Shock configuration of U.S. global economic hegemony was back.

### With the spread of global commerce, trade cumulatively begat more trade, production cumulatively begat more production, and economic activity brought increasing returns. Throughout the world, millions of people escaped economic deprivation.6 In particular, China, which joined the World Trade Organization

### An upswing in the global credit cycle meant that money capital financed long-term investment in wealth-generating trade, enterprise, and employment. Prosperity boomeranged. Gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of world GDP, depressed relative to the postwar past ever since the 1980s, now even began to rise after 2002.8 But the upswing in the credit cycle also meant that money capital could fund short-term speculation for its own sake in liquid assets. Liquid assets, furthermore, potentially enabled a precautionary propensity to hoard, at the expense of either short-term speculation or long-term investment.

### The Chinese Communist Party did not direct its manufacturing export earnings to domestic investment, which was far more state-directed than dependent on the global financial system. Instead, China chose to invest much of the savings earned from its exports in the U.S. capital market, especially in U.S. public debt. These Chinese investments helped finance the U.S. trade deficit, which helped sustain American consumption of Chinese-produced goods. This was the post–Volcker Shock configuration of American global hegemony, on steroids.

### That they would rise became ever more important, for the post-2001 business expansion featured a historically abysmal labor market, a “jobless” recovery. The labor force participation rate actually declined

### The Fed always lowering interest rates when asset prices declined had the same effect—downside protection, which encouraged more risk-taking. The term Greenspan put became even more prominent when, in response to the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, the Fed lowered its interest rate target to soothe jittery global capital markets.

### That framed the issue as a matter of personal malfeasance and responsibility and nothing more—certainly nothing systemically wrong about U.S. capital markets.

### the 2001 Bush tax cuts budged activity so much. The law slashed marginal income tax rates across the board between 3 and 5 percent. The Bush administration came back for more tax cuts in 2003, and the budget was back in deficit, after Bush had inherited a budget surplus from Clinton. “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter,” Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, declared.24 True, foreign capital—from Japan especially in the 1980s, from China especially in the 2000s—had proved willing to finance U.S. budget deficits. They purchased U.S. Treasury bills, depressing long-term interest rates, because they wanted assets denominated in the currency of the global hegemon, and they were happy to finance the U.S. trade deficit, if only to fund U.S. consumption of their goods.

### By the time American troops poured into Iraq, the Fed had reduced the federal funds target to 1 percent, where it remained until the summer of 2004. The Age of Chaos had opened with the high interest rates of the Volcker Shock, which reestablished the scarcity value of money capital. Now the historically low short-term interest rate of the Greenspan put induced a most extraordinary speculative upswing in the global credit cycle.

### Between 1990 and 2011, China’s share of world manufacturing exports climbed from 2 percent to 16 percent. From 2001 to 2011, the Chinese share of U.S. manufacturing imports climbed from 10.9 percent to 23.1 percent.43 After 2000, the “China trade shock” was a great contributor to the starkly diverging economic fates of American economic regions.

### According to one estimate, “import growth from China between 1999 and 2011 led to an employment reduction of 2.4 million workers” in the United States. The above map of 2000s U.S. “trade exposure” reveals that cities such as Detroit, Buffalo, and Providence were hit hard. So were rural areas of Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Indiana.

### Short-term interest rate hikes by the Fed beginning in 2004 did not cause a dent in long-term rates. The global demand for long-term U.S. debt—whether safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, government-sponsored enterprise debt, or even banks’ “private label” MBSs and CDOs—was simply extraordinary.81 Between 2000 and 2006, led by China, foreign owners of U.S. Treasury debt climbed from $0.6 trillion to $1.43 trillion, from 18.2 percent to 28.8 percent of all U.S. debt. Foreign ownership of Fannie and Freddie bonds increased from $348 billion in 2000 to $875 billion in 2004.82 European banks especially were buying up extraordinary amounts of American MBSs and mortgage-referenced assets.

### Indirectly, the Chinese hoarding of its export earnings in safe dollar assets made possible the extraordinary speculative investment boom in residential American real estate.

### In early 2007 subprime delinquencies hit 20 percent. Still, the banks kept securitizing. After the summer of 2006, banks led by Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman engineered another $1.3 trillion in MBSs and another $350 billion in CDOs that referenced mortgages. Citigroup was among the many banks that were holding most of their mortgage assets as investments. Finally on July 10, 2007, Moody’s downgraded 399 mortgage-backed securities that had been issued in 2006.90

### Meanwhile many worrisome trends that had first appeared in the early twenty-first-century persisted. Geographical disparities in economic life outcomes worsened.97 The waning of market competition and the rise of corporate monopoly and monopsony power continued to exacerbate.98 Finally, the frequency of “deaths of despair” from alcoholism, drug…

### The Fed had lost control of the long-term interest rate before the crisis, when raising short-term interest rates in 2004 did nothing to raise long-term rates. Now, with short-term rates at zero, long-term rates remained stuck high. So in another unconventional monetary policy, the Fed purchased billions of dollars of long-term bonds, mostly U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. mortgage bonds, hoping to bring down long-term rates. The goal of lowering the pecuniary return for parking cash on the sidelines was to induce greater immediate private investment and spending. The strange name for this policy was “quantitative easing.”  
---

### In the new “unconventional” monetary policy of quantitative easing, the Fed expanded its balance sheet by purchasing long-term bonds, hoping it would bring down interest rates and thereby induce private spending, especially on investment. The policy worked, but through the channel of more asset price appreciation.  
---

### Thus, many pre-2008 trends carried over into the 2010s. Investment and productivity growth remained weak. Infrastructure dilapidated. A fossil fuel–based energy system persisted—entrenched further by a 2010s domestic oil fracking boom, capitalized by the decade’s cheap credit. Large corporations, especially the great technology companies, accumulated more market power and profits.  
---

### Meanwhile as asset prices recovered first, delivering gains to their owners, economic inequality continued its upward march until 2014. Although, during this decade inequality finally became a matter of public debate and concern. Job creation focused in the high-paying and low-paying services, still exhibiting pronounced geographical disparities, as well as disparities concerning educational attainment. White male “deaths of despair” continued, while the most historically disadvantaged groups, as always, continued to fare the worst.
