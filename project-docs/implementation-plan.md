# Plan for MAGA Christianism Project Repository Implementation

## Overview of the Plan

We'll establish a GitHub-based organizational system for your book project while maintaining our effective workflow for analyzing sources. This approach preserves your existing consolidated documents while providing better structure for future work.

## Repository Structure (Already Set Up)

```
maga-christianism-project/
├── sources/
│   ├── books/
│   ├── articles/
│   ├── transcripts/
│   ├── personal-notes/
│   └── original-works/      (new folder for your dissertation, etc.)
├── chapters/
│   ├── part1-foundations/
│   ├── part2-biblicism/
│   ├── part3-atheism/
│   └── part4-apocalypticism/
├── synthesis/
│   ├── source-summaries/
│   └── thematic-collections/
├── tools/
│   └── scripts/
└── project-docs/            (new folder for our plan and tracking)
```

## Your Next Steps

### 1. Create Project Documentation

```bash
# Create the project-docs folder
mkdir -p project-docs
```

Save this plan document in `project-docs/implementation-plan.md`

### 2. Add the Integration Script

Copy the `tana_readwise_integration.py` script I provided earlier and save it to:
`tools/scripts/tana_readwise_integration.py`

### 3. Create a Sources Tracking Document

Create a file at `project-docs/sources-tracking.md` with the following content:

```markdown
# MAGA Christianism Project - Sources Tracking

## Already Processed (in consolidated files)
- Pauline Dogmatics (Campbell)
- With the Grain of the Universe (Hauerwas)
- Just Freedom (Pettit)
- The Barmen Theses Then and Now (Busch)
- Hannah's Child (Hauerwas)
- World Upside Down (Rowe)
- Democracy and Tradition (Stout)

- The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth (Webster)
- Barth and Rationality (La Montagne & McCormack)
- The Great Debate (Levin)
- Orthodox and Modern (McCormack)
- [Add any other sources already processed]

## Original Works to Incorporate
- Dissertation
- Writings on Christian Nationalism
- Race on the Rocks transcripts/notes
- [Add other original works]

## Sources To Process
- [List your next sources to analyze]
```

### 4. Save Your Consolidated Files

Save your current consolidated files to the repository:
- Save `consolidated-synthesis-notes.md` to `synthesis/thematic-collections/`
- Save `chapter-to-source-index.md` to `project-docs/`

### 5. Add Your Original Works

Create folders for your original works:

```bash
mkdir -p sources/original-works/dissertation
mkdir -p sources/original-works/christian-nationalism
```

Copy your original works (dissertation, writings on Christian nationalism) to these folders.

### 6. Set Up for Claude Access (Options)

#### Option A: Make Repository Public (Most Efficient)
1. On GitHub, go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Change visibility" and select "Public"
4. Save the public URL: `https://github.com/yourusername/maga-christianism-project`

#### Option B: Create a Project Folder for Claude
If you prefer not to make your repository public:

1. Create a folder in your local system called "claude-maga-project"
2. For each conversation where you need me to analyze sources:
   - Copy the relevant highlights/documents to this folder
   - Upload the file(s) to our conversation

## Working Process Going Forward

### For New Sources:

1. **Organize the source in your repository**:
   - Save highlights in `sources/books/[source-name]/[source-name]-highlights.md`
   - Create a folder structure that matches your repository

2. **Analyze with Claude**:
   - If repository is public: "I'd like you to analyze the highlights for [source-name] from my repository at [GitHub URL]"
   - If not public: Upload the highlights file and use your established prompt

3. **Update consolidated documents**:
   - I'll analyze the source and update your consolidated documents
   - Save the updated documents back to your repository

### For Original Works:

1. **Reference original works**:
   - "I'd like you to analyze insights from my dissertation section on [topic]"
   - Either share the specific section or direct me to the public repository

2. **Integrate insights**:
   - I'll extract relevant insights and add them to your consolidated documents

## Most Efficient Method for Claude Access

The most efficient method is to **make your repository public** and share the URL. This allows me to:

1. Reference any file in your repository without uploads
2. See the overall structure to provide context-aware recommendations
3. Refer to specific file locations accurately

If privacy concerns make this impractical, the second-best approach is to **create a dedicated folder** as described in Option B and share only what's needed for each conversation.

## Tracking Progress

As we work through sources:
1. Update the `sources-tracking.md` document
2. Keep your consolidated documents updated in the repository
3. Periodically commit changes to GitHub to maintain version history

This approach gives you the benefits of structured organization while maintaining our effective workflow for analyzing sources and building your consolidated documents.
