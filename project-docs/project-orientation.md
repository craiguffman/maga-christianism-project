# MAGA Christianism Project Orientation

This document provides key context for my ongoing research project examining the intersection of MAGA politics and Christian identity in America.

## Essential Project Resources
- **Voice Guide**: [Voice & Synthesis Style Guide](https://github.com/craiguffman/maga-christianism-project/blob/main/project-docs/guides/voice-synthesis-guide.md) - Defines my writing approach: accessible, journalistic style balancing storytelling with analysis; intellectual rigor with approachable language.
- **Content Structure**: [Chapter-to-Source Index](https://github.com/craiguffman/maga-christianism-project/blob/main/project-docs/guides/chapter-to-source-index.md) - Maps how sources connect to project chapters.
- **Evolving Synthesis**: [Consolidated Synthesis Notes](https://github.com/craiguffman/maga-christianism-project/blob/main/synthesis/thematic-collections/consolidated-synthesis-notes.md) - Contains my developing thoughts integrating various sources.

## Project Structure
- **Sources**: Original texts, interviews, and research materials
- **Synthesis**: 
  - Source summaries (extracted highlights and notes)
  - Thematic collections (cross-source analysis)
- **Project-docs**: Guides and planning documents
- **Drafts**: Working chapter drafts

## Research Focus
Examining how economic history, religious identity, and political movements intersect in the contemporary MAGA-Christianity phenomenon, with particular attention to how economic conditions might influence religious-political identity formation.

## Tools & Workflow
I use Tana for note-taking, Readwise for highlights, and Python scripts to integrate and organize research materials. When analyzing sources, please consider both the original content and my notes (atomic, synthesis, and permanent notes) to understand my developing thesis. My goal is to publish 800-word SubStack posts, 90-second videos, and ePub books like Kindle. 

# Integration Workflow: Claude, Tana, Scrivener & GitHub

## Overview

This workflow integrates four powerful tools to streamline your book writing process:

1. **Claude** - AI assistant for ideation, research, drafting, and feedback
2. **Tana** - Knowledge management and organization
3. **Scrivener** - Manuscript drafting and editing
4. **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Research & Ideation (Claude + Tana)

**Process:**
- Use Claude to generate research questions, explore themes, and develop initial concepts
- Organize research findings in Tana using its SumNodes and networked structure
- Create dedicated Tana nodes for key concepts, historical references, and source materials
- Use Claude to analyze and synthesize source materials


### 2. Outlining & Structure (Tana → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Use Tana's hierarchical structure to develop chapter outlines and book structure
- Refine outline with Claude's feedback
- Transfer approved structure to Scrivener's binder

### 3. Drafting (Claude → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Generate initial drafts with Claude based on your outline
- Use Claude to expand bullet points into paragraphs
- Paste refined content into Scrivener documents
- Use Scrivener's composition mode for focused writing and editing


### 4. Version Control & Collaboration (Scrivener → GitHub)

**Process:**
- Export Scrivener documents as markdown files
- Commit to GitHub repository
- Create branches for major revisions or alternate approaches
- Use GitHub Issues to track editorial tasks


### 5. Revision & Feedback (GitHub → Claude → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Use Claude to review specific sections from GitHub markdown files
- Implement Claude's suggestions in Scrivener
- Track revision history in GitHub
