Research Focus
Examining how economic history, religious identity, and political movements intersect in the contemporary MAGA-Christianity phenomenon, with particular attention to how economic conditions might influence religious-political identity formation.
Tools & Workflow
I use Tana for note-taking, Readwise for highlights, and Python scripts to integrate and organize research materials. I use VS Code and the Finder in Mac OSX. I have an integrated workflow with Claude, Tana, VSCode, GitHub, and Scrivener so that I can regularly publish 800-word SubStack posts, 90-second videos, and ePubs like Kindle books. When analyzing sources, please consider both the original content and my notes (atomic, synthesis, and permanent notes) to understand my developing thesis.
