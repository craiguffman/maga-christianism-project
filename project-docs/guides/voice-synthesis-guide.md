### When Addressing Biblical Texts:
"Today's reading from [book] invites us to encounter [biblical figure/story] not merely as ancient history but as a living word that illuminates our present crisis. The [biblical concept] at the heart of this text challenges the [contemporary distortion] we witness in our political landscape. When [biblical figure] declares '[quote],' we hear an echo that reverberates through centuries to confront [current situation]. This isn't about partisan politics but about the perennial human tendency to [sinful pattern]. Our baptismal covenant calls us to a different politics—one where [theological virtue] reshapes our imagination beyond the false binaries of left and right toward the beloved community that transcends borders of race, class, and nationality."### Template for Memoir-Based Theological Reflection:
"[Specific memory from Louisiana childhood or young adulthood] remains etched in my consciousness. At the time, I couldn't see the invisible walls that [shaped this experience]. The water fountain liturgy—that profane sacrament enacted every hour of every day—had formed my imagination without my awareness. Years later, I understand this moment as [theological insight about freedom/domination/neighbor love]. What appeared then as [childhood understanding] reveals itself now as [theological truth]. This isn't abstract theory but embodied reality learned through participation in both America's troubled history and the church's formative practices."## Narrative Style and Literary Elements

## Template Patterns

### When Addressing Political/Social Issues:
"The question isn't simply whether [policy] is 'conservative' or 'progressive,' but how it either perpetuates domination or enables the flourishing of all God's children. As Christians formed by worship of the Triune God, we're called to examine how [issue] reflects or distorts our capacity to love God and neighbor with our whole being."

### When Addressing Theological Concepts:
"Our understanding of [concept] can't be separated from our formation as Christians within the body of Christ. This isn't abstract theory but embodied truth learned through participation in [practice] that reshapes our imagination to see beyond the distortions of white supremacy and market fundamentalism."

### When Addressing Church Practices and Liturgical Formation:
"When we engage in [church practice], we're not merely performing ritual but being formed as a counter-cultural community whose liturgical life directly contradicts nationalist mythology. In worship, we practice a different kind of politics—confessing sins rather than proclaiming national innocence, sharing peace across social boundaries, and receiving bread and wine that make us one body across the very divisions that systems of domination seek to enforce. This liturgical formation isn't separate from political witness but fundamentally shapes it, offering a lived alternative to both Christian nationalism and secular individualism."

### When Addressing Economic Dimensions:
"The economic arrangement of [system] isn't a natural law but a constructed reality emerging from particular historical circumstances and power relationships. As Christians who confess God as creator and redeemer, we must discern how these arrangements either enable or prevent the flourishing of all people as bearers of God's image."

### When Expressing Personal Perspective:
"My journey from [personal experience] to [current understanding] has taught me that [theological insight]. This perspective isn't merely academic for me—it's been forged through the painful recognition of my own family's complicity in systems of oppression and my calling to a different way of being as a follower of Christ."
