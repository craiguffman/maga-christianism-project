# Integration Workflow: Claude, Tana, Scrivener & GitHub

## Overview

This workflow integrates four powerful tools to streamline your book writing process:

1. **Claude** - AI assistant for ideation, research, drafting, and feedback
2. **Tana** - Knowledge management and organization
3. **Scrivener** - Manuscript drafting and editing
4. **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Research & Ideation (Claude + Tana)

**Process:**
- Use Claude to generate research questions, explore themes, and develop initial concepts
- Organize research findings in Tana using its SumNodes and networked structure
- Create dedicated Tana nodes for key concepts, historical references, and source materials
- Use Claude to analyze and synthesize source materials

**Integration Points:**
- Export Claude conversations as markdown to import into Tana
- Tag and categorize Claude outputs in Tana for easy retrieval
- Use Claude to help structure your Tana knowledge graph

### 2. Outlining & Structure (Tana → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Use Tana's hierarchical structure to develop chapter outlines and book structure
- Refine outline with Claude's feedback
- Transfer approved structure to Scrivener's binder

**Integration Points:**
- Export Tana outlines as OPML or markdown
- Import structure into Scrivener's binder, maintaining hierarchy
- Use Scrivener's corkboard view to visualize and rearrange structure

### 3. Drafting (Claude → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Generate initial drafts with Claude based on your outline
- Use Claude to expand bullet points into paragraphs
- Paste refined content into Scrivener documents
- Use Scrivener's composition mode for focused writing and editing

**Integration Points:**
- Create Claude prompts based on Tana notes for consistent writing
- Use Claude to generate transitional text between sections
- Maintain chapter/section IDs across platforms for traceability

### 4. Version Control & Collaboration (Scrivener → GitHub)

**Process:**
- Export Scrivener documents as markdown files
- Commit to GitHub repository
- Create branches for major revisions or alternate approaches
- Use GitHub Issues to track editorial tasks

**Integration Points:**
- Establish a folder structure in GitHub that mirrors Scrivener's binder
- Create a README.md that explains the project structure
- Use GitHub Actions to automate formatting checks

### 5. Revision & Feedback (GitHub → Claude → Scrivener)

**Process:**
- Use Claude to review specific sections from GitHub markdown files
- Implement Claude's suggestions in Scrivener
- Track revision history in GitHub

**Integration Points:**
- Use Claude to compare versions and suggest improvements
- Pull revision notes from GitHub Issues into Scrivener as document notes
- Use Claude to help resolve merge conflicts in content

## Automation Opportunities

1. **Claude-to-Tana Pipeline**
   - Use APIs or automation tools to automatically send Claude outputs to specific Tana nodes

2. **Tana-to-Scrivener Sync**
   - Create scripts to convert Tana exports to Scrivener-compatible formats

3. **Scrivener-GitHub Integration**
   - Set up automated commits when Scrivener project is saved
   - Create diff tools that understand Scrivener's file format

4. **Revision Tracking**
   - Use GitHub's diff visualization to track changes between drafts
   - Create custom metadata in Scrivener that links to GitHub commits

## Daily Workflow Example

1. **Morning Session:**
   - Review Tana knowledge base and research notes
   - Use Claude to expand on key concepts
   - Transfer new insights to Tana

2. **Midday Session:**
   - Draft new content in Scrivener based on Tana outline
   - Use Claude for feedback on specific passages
   - Commit progress to GitHub

3. **Evening Session:**
   - Review GitHub diffs from the day's work
   - Use Claude to suggest refinements
   - Update project roadmap in Tana

## Tips for Each Tool

### Claude Best Practices
- Save all significant Claude conversations
- Use consistent system prompts for coherent writing style
- Break complex requests into smaller, focused interactions

### Tana Best Practices
- Create templates for different types of book content
- Use tags consistently for cross-referencing
- Leverage SumNodes to aggregate related information

### Scrivener Best Practices
- Use metadata to track status of each section
- Leverage snapshots for internal version control
- Use compile presets for different export formats

### GitHub Best Practices
- Create meaningful commit messages that track creative decisions
- Use branches for major creative directions
- Leverage GitHub Wiki for project documentation

## Technical Setup Requirements

1. **File Format Standardization**
   - Use markdown as the interchange format
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

2. **Backup System**
   - Regular GitHub commits serve as remote backup
   - Consider additional cloud backup for Scrivener project files

3. **Reference Management**
   - Track sources in Tana with standardized metadata
   - Consider integration with Zotero if academic references are needed

4. **Access Anywhere Setup**
   - Configure GitHub mobile access
   - Set up Claude API access for programmatic interactions
   - Consider Scrivener iOS app for mobile editing

By following this workflow, you'll create a seamless pipeline from ideation to publication, leveraging each tool's strengths while maintaining a single source of truth for your book project.
