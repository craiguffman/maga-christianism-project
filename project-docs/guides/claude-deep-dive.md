## Integration with Unified Workflow

This deep dive guide works in conjunction with the Unified Workflow Guide. All commands and techniques in this document follow the same terminology and process structure as the main workflow.

For basic workflow processes, always refer to the Unified Workflow Guide as the authoritative source. This document extends those foundations with specialized techniques for complex analysis and content development.
