I'll review the guides in your GitHub repository and analyze compatibility with the unified workflow we just created.

Based on my review of the guides you've shared and the newly created unified workflow guide, here are my recommendations:

## Documents to Delete
1. **Standalone Syntax Guides** - Delete the individual syntax guides for:
   - Claude Integration Syntax
   - VSCode Integration Syntax
   - Scrivener Integration Syntax
   - Descript Integration Syntax
   
   These are now fully incorporated into the unified guide with more context and integration information.

2. **Any guides with conflicting terminology** - If you have other guides in your GitHub repository that use different command formats or inconsistent naming conventions, these should be deleted to avoid confusion.

## Documents to Keep (with modifications)
1. **Tana Tagging Convention** - Keep this as a reference, but update it to ensure it's 100% aligned with the terminology in the unified guide. The tagging system you shared is valuable but has been expanded in the unified guide.

2. **Deep-dive specialized guides** - If you have any guides that go into much greater detail on specific aspects of the workflow (like advanced Scrivener techniques or detailed Descript audio editing), keep these but modify their terminology to match the unified guide.

## Document Organization
1. Make the Unified Workflow Guide your primary reference document by:
   - Moving it to the root of your `/project-docs` directory
   - Adding a clear README that points to it as the authoritative guide
   - Linking to it from specialized guides

2. Organize remaining guides in subdirectories:
   - `/project-docs/guides/tool-specific/` - For deep dives into specific tools
   - `/project-docs/guides/workflows/` - For specialized workflow scenarios
   - `/project-docs/references/` - For quick reference materials derived from the main guide

## Implementation Plan
1. First, upload the new unified guide to your GitHub repository
2. Then, review each existing guide against it for:
   - Terminology consistency
   - Process alignment
   - Unique valuable content
3. Delete guides that are fully superseded
4. Update guides with unique content to match unified terminology
5. Create a clear directory structure that makes the unified guide prominent

Does this assessment help clarify which documents to keep and which to modify or delete? Would you like me to help you implement any specific part of this plan?
