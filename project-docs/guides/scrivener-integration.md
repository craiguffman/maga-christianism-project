# Integrating Scrivener with Your MAGA Christianism Project

Scrivener could significantly enhance your writing workflow while complementing your GitHub repository setup. Here's how to integrate the two effectively:

## Initial Scrivener Setup for Your Project

1. **Create a new Scrivener project** with the "Non-Fiction" template
   
2. **Set up your binder structure** to mirror your theological framework:
   ```
   - Front Matter
   - Part I: Foundations
     - Chapter 1: Introducing the Crisis
     - Chapter 2: Trinitarian Foundation
     - Chapter 3: Knowledge of God
     - Chapter 4: Formation of Virtue
   - Part II: Primitive Biblicism
     - [Chapters 5-8]
   - Part III: Practical Atheism
     - [Chapters 9-12]
   - Part IV: Binary Apocalypticism
     - [Chapters 13-16]
   - Back Matter
     - Bibliography
     - Appendices
   ```

3. **Create a Research folder** with subfolders that parallel your source categories:
   ```
   - Research
     - Primary Sources
     - Theological Works
     - Original Works
     - Video Transcripts
     - Personal Reflections
     - Consolidated Notes
   ```

## Workflow Integration Between GitHub and Scrivener

### Importing from GitHub to Scrivener

1. **Import consolidated documents** from your GitHub repository:
   - Import `consolidated-synthesis-notes.md` into your Research folder
   - Import `chapter-to-source-index.md` for reference
   - These become your master reference documents within Scrivener

2. **Reference material workflow**:
   - When we analyze a new source in Claude, save the updated consolidated files
   - Import these updated files into Scrivener periodically (weekly or after significant additions)

3. **Use snapshots** in Scrivener before updating imported files to track changes

### Draft Development Process

1. **Stage 1: Outline from chapter-to-source index**
   - Create detailed outlines for each chapter based on your index
   - Use Scrivener's synopsis feature to summarize each section's purpose

2. **Stage 2: Block drafting**
   - Draft sections using split-screen with your sources on one side
   - Reference our consolidated notes while composing
   - Use Scrivener's labels to mark draft status (rough, revised, polished)

3. **Stage 3: Integration and flow**
   - Use Scrivener's composition mode for focused editing
   - Add transitions between sections
   - Review document notes for consistency

## Practical Workflow Example

Here's how this might look in practice for Chapter 5 on Ramist Realism:

1. In Scrivener, open the chapter document and split-screen with `chapter-to-source-index.md`

2. Review the sources listed for Chapter 5:
   - McCormack's critique of foundationalism
   - Wittgenstein on language and public criteria
   - Von Balthasar on theological knowledge
   - etc.

3. Create subdocuments for each major section of the chapter

4. For each section:
   - Review relevant parts of `consolidated-synthesis-notes.md`
   - Draft the section using insights from our analysis
   - Add document notes with questions or areas to develop

5. Use Scrivener's composition mode to refine and connect the sections

## Technical Integration Tips

1. **File management**:
   - Keep your Scrivener project in a separate folder from your GitHub repository
   - Export compiled drafts to your `chapters` folders in the repository periodically

2. **Research synchronization**:
   - When new analysis is completed, update your research materials in Scrivener
   - Use Scrivener's import folder feature to keep research current

3. **Version control**:
   - Scrivener has its own versioning through snapshots
   - For major milestones, export compiled chapters to your GitHub repository

4. **Backup strategy**:
   - Configure Scrivener's automatic backup
   - GitHub serves as secondary backup for exported compiled files
   - Consider additional cloud backup for the Scrivener project file itself

## Benefits of This Integrated Approach

1. **Separation of concerns**:
   - GitHub: Source material organization, version control, collaboration
   - Scrivener: Composition environment, manuscript development, drafting
   - Claude: Analysis, synthesis, feedback on drafts

2. **Flexible writing environment**:
   - Write non-linearly as theological insights develop
   - Easily reorganize content as your argument evolves
   - Track progress on specific sections

3. **Comprehensive research access**:
   - All source material and analysis available within your writing environment
   - Split-screen referencing while drafting
   - Searchable research database

## Scrivener Features Particularly Useful for Theological Writing

1. **Keywords and metadata**:
   - Tag sections with theological concepts
   - Track references to key theologians
   - Create custom metadata for tracking which mutation each section addresses

2. **Comments and annotations**:
   - Add theological nuances to consider
   - Note connections between different theological traditions
   - Mark areas where further research is needed

3. **Collections**:
   - Create dynamic collections for each theological mutation
   - Group related theological concepts across chapters
   - Assemble sections that address specific theologians

4. **Compile options**:
   - Create different versions for different audiences
   - Produce drafts with or without scholarly apparatus
   - Generate sections for peer review
